2018,"On Gab, an Extremist-Friendly Site, Pittsburgh Shooting Suspect Aired His Hatred in Full","Early Saturday, moments before the police say he barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue and opened fire, Robert Bowers’s anti-Semitic rage finally boiled over as he posted one last message online. But he did not turn to Facebook or Twitter. Instead, the man accused of killing 11 people went to Gab, a two-year-old social network that bills itself as a “free speech” alternative to those platforms, and that has become a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists. There, he posted a signoff to his followers: The shooting in Pittsburgh came on the heels of another violent episode involving social media extremism. Cesar Sayoc Jr., the suspect in the pipe bomb mailing campaign, had a history of posting hateful and violent messages on Facebook and Twitter that were laced with misinformation and conspiracy theories. There have long been hateful enclaves online, and chat rooms and message boards where white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists have congregated. But the popularity of mainstream mega-platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has created environments in which misinformation and hate can multiply, and where extremists can attempt to convert — or “red pill,” in the parlance of right-wing internet activists — a new generation to their cause. [Related coverage: What we know about the Pittsburgh suspect, Robert Bowers. The victims of the shooting are identified. The latest developments in the Pittsburgh massacre. ] Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, once guided by the principle of free speech, have come to realize that an anything-goes approach is ripe for exploitation, and ultimately bad for business. “The challenge faced by any platform that allows everything permitted under U.S. law is that if left unabated, the most objectionable content will inevitably take over,” said Micah Schaffer, a former policy leader at YouTube and Snap who is now a technology policy consultant. “If an online community is dominated by porn, beheadings or white supremacists, most people aren’t going to think it’s a good place for their baby photos.” Facebook and Twitter’s attempts to crack down on hateful and violent speech have been inconsistent, and many objectionable posts still slip through the cracks. (Mr. Sayoc, for instance, was reported to Twitter for making a violent threat against a Democratic television commentator this month, but the company declined to take action against him, a decision it has since said was in error.) But the companies have made earnest efforts to clean up their platforms — and in the process, they have pushed some extremists to alternative venues like Gab. Mr. Bowers’s affiliation with Gab has already cost the company dearly. On Saturday, the company’s web hosting provider, Joyent, said it would stop hosting the site, according to an email posted by Gab on Twitter. Gab’s website went offline Sunday night and was replaced with a statement saying that its service would be temporarily inaccessible while it switched to a new hosting provider. “We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers and several payment processors,” the statement read. In addition, GoDaddy, the domain name provider, told Gab it had 24 hours to move its domain name to another service, after finding content on the site that promoted violence. The payment processing platform Stripe, which Gab has used to receive fees for its paid Gab Pro membership level, and which froze Gab’s account this month for violating its terms of service, said it was suspending transfers to the company’s bank account pending an investigation, according to another email posted to Twitter by Gab. PayPal, another payment processor, canceled Gab’s account, saying it had been closely monitoring the site even before Saturday’s massacre. “When a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,” a PayPal spokesman said. Joyent did not respond to a request for comment. A Stripe spokesman said the company could not comment on individual users for privacy reasons. Gab, which was started in 2016 by a conservative programmer, Andrew Torba, who was fed up with what he saw as Silicon Valley’s left-wing censorship, was a controversial project from the start. The announcement of its introduction doubled as a broadside against political correctness, which the company said had “become a cancer on discourse and culture.” Gab, its creator said, would be a social network where all speech would be welcome, no matter how noxious or offensive. In an email interview on Saturday, Mr. Torba, Gab’s chief executive, said that he had not reviewed all of Mr. Bowers’s posts, but that the company had turned over information about his account to law enforcement agencies and was cooperating with the investigation. “Because he was on Gab, law enforcement now have definitive evidence for a motive,” Mr. Torba wrote. “They would not have had this evidence without Gab. We are proud to work with and support law enforcement in order to bring justice to this alleged terrorist.” Technically, there was nothing special about Gab at the start — its interface was buggy and unattractive, and it lacked the features of more established social networks. But the platform’s intentionally slim rule book attracted a crowd of extremists, including white nationalists and neo-Nazis, who had been banned from other social platforms. Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart writer whose harassment campaigns got him kicked off Twitter, signed up for an account. So did Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi publication Daily Stormer, and Richard Spencer, the well-known white nationalist. Within months, Gab had become a last refuge for internet scoundrels — a place where those with views considered too toxic for the mainstream could congregate and converse freely. The site’s guidelines prohibit threats of violence, but not hateful speech. Gab’s reputation for accommodating extremism may have been what drew Mr. Bowers to the site. In January, he signed up for an account, and began sharing anti-Jewish images, conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world, and criticism of President Trump — whom, he implied, was too accommodating of Jewish influence. He appeared to have other social media accounts, but Gab was where he aired his hatred in full. His bio on the site read, “Jews are the children of Satan,” and a photo on his profile included the number 1488, a reference to Nazism that is popular among white supremacists. After Mr. Bowers was named as a suspect in the mass shooting, Gab released a statement saying it “unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” The company spent much of Saturday replying to its critics on Twitter, and deflecting blame by pointing out that Mr. Bowers also had accounts on other social networks. The company boasted that its website was getting a million views per hour in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh shooting. This is not Gab’s first run-in with controversy. Last year, Google banned the company’s app for failing to moderate hateful content. (The app was rejected by Apple.) In August, Microsoft threatened to cut off Gab’s access to its Azure cloud service after posts surfaced on the site advocating genocidal violence against Jews. The posts were ultimately taken down. Mr. Torba insisted in his email that the shooting had not changed his mind about Gab’s core mission of promoting free speech. “Twitter and other platforms police ‘hate speech’ as long as it isn’t against President Trump, white people, Christians, or minorities who have walked away from the Democratic Party,” he wrote. “This double standard does not exist on Gab.” What did exist on Gab was a flurry of posts made by people who appeared to share Mr. Bowers’s hatred for Jews. The site, which functions like a combination of Twitter and Reddit and claims to have more than 700,000 members, is not exclusively for bigots. It has areas for various interest groups, including cryptocurrency traders, doomsday preppers and fans of Japanese-style animated pornography. But Gab’s most popular posts espouse far-right ideology. “Gab became their safe haven because it was actively recruiting the worst of the worst,” said Joan Donovan, a media manipulation researcher with the nonprofit organization Data and Society. “Gab’s users have complained of a global Jewish conspiracy to control the internet, where Gab is the only place online where they can network with one another.” In the past several years, as Twitter and Facebook have stepped up their enforcement of policies to prevent hate speech and abuse, some white nationalists and neo-Nazis have been forced to find other ways to communicate. Discord, a chat app built for video gamers, became a haven of white nationalists last year, who used the service to plan and execute the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. The company subsequently shut down several large far-right groups, but many have since reappeared. On Saturday, a Discord channel populated by neo-Nazis filled with chatter and gossip about Mr. Bowers’s possible involvement in a mass shooting of Jews. Several members praised Mr. Bowers, while others criticized him for jeopardizing the neo-Nazi movement’s long-term prospects by resorting to violence. “This guy just blew out the kneecaps of the movement in order to kill some no name Jews,” one member wrote. A Discord spokeswoman said the company had investigated and found some accounts that violated its terms of service, which it deleted, although she said the accounts were not directly linked to the shooting. On Gab, however, the talk was less about Mr. Bowers and the anti-Jewish movement, and more about what was happening to the platform itself. On Saturday, as Gab’s service providers began to cut ties, one of the most popular posts on the site speculated that the company was being unfairly targeted because “Gab is the free speech platform Jews want to destroy.” Asked if Gab would be changing any of its policies in response to the mass shooting, Mr. Torba gave an unequivocal answer. “Absolutely not.”",The New York Times
2018,"On Instagram, 11,696 Examples of How Hate Thrives on Social Media","SAN FRANCISCO — On Monday, a search on Instagram, the photo-sharing site owned by Facebook, produced a torrent of anti-Semitic images and videos uploaded in the wake of Saturday’s shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. A search for the word “Jews” displayed 11,696 posts with the hashtag “#jewsdid911,” claiming that Jews had orchestrated the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Other hashtags on Instagram referenced Nazi ideology, including the number 88, an abbreviation used for the Nazi salute “Heil Hitler.” The Instagram posts demonstrated a stark reality. Over the last 10 years, Silicon Valley’s social media companies have expanded their reach and influence to the furthest corners of the world. But it has become glaringly apparent that the companies never quite understood the negative consequences of that influence nor what to do about it — and that they cannot put the genie back in the bottle. “Social media is emboldening people to cross the line and push the envelope on what they are willing to say to provoke and to incite,” said Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. “The problem is clearly expanding.” The repercussions of the social media companies’ inability to handle disinformation and hate speech have manifested themselves abundantly in recent days. Cesar Sayoc Jr., who was charged last week with sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats, appeared to have been radicalized online by partisan posts on Twitter and Facebook. Robert D. Bowers, who is accused of killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, posted about his hatred of Jews on Gab, a two-year-old social network. The effects of social media were also evident globally. Close watchers of Brazil’s election on Sunday ascribed much of the appeal of the victor, the far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro, to what unfolded on social media there. Interests tied to Mr. Bolsonaro’s campaign appeared to have flooded WhatsApp, the messaging application owned by Facebook, with a deluge of political content that gave wrong information on voting locations and times, provided false instructions on how to vote for particular candidates and outright disparaged one of Mr. Bolsonaro’s main opponents, Fernando Haddad. Elsewhere, high-ranking members of the Myanmar military have used doctored messages on Facebook to foment anxiety and fear against the Muslim Rohingya minority group. And in India, fake stories on WhatsApp about child kidnappings led mobs to murder more than a dozen people this year. “Social media companies have created, allowed and enabled extremists to move their message from the margins to the mainstream,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a nongovernmental organization that combats hate speech. “In the past, they couldn’t find audiences for their poison. Now, with a click or a post or a tweet, they can spread their ideas with a velocity we’ve never seen before.” Facebook said it was investigating the anti-Semitic hashtags on Instagram after The New York Times flagged them. Sarah Pollack, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement that Instagram was seeing new posts related to the shooting on Saturday and that it was “actively reviewing hashtags and content related to these events and removing content that violates our policies.” YouTube said it has strict policies prohibiting content that promotes hatred or incites violence and added that it takes down videos that violate those rules. Social media companies have said that identifying and removing hate speech and disinformation — or even defining what constitutes such content — is difficult. Facebook said this year that only 38 percent of hate speech on its site was flagged by its internal systems. In contrast, its systems pinpointed and took down 96 percent of what it defined as adult nudity, and 99.5 percent of terrorist content. YouTube said users reported nearly 10 million videos from April to June for potentially violating its community guidelines. Just under one million of those videos were found to have broken the rules and were removed, according to the company’s data. YouTube’s automated detection tools also took down an additional 6.8 million videos in that period. A study by researchers from M.I.T. that was published in March found that falsehoods on Twitter were 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than accurate news. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all announced plans to invest heavily in artificial intelligence and other technology aimed at finding and removing unwanted content from their sites. Facebook has also said it would hire 10,000 additional people to work on safety and security issues, and YouTube has said that it planned to have 10,000 people dedicated to reviewing videos. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, recently said that although the company’s longtime principle was free expression, it was discussing how “safety should come first.” But even as the companies throw money and resources at the problems, some of their employees said on Monday that they were rethinking whether the social media services could have a positive effect. At Twitter, for example, employees are increasingly concerned that the company is floundering in its treatment of toxic language and hate speech, said four current and former employees who asked for anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. The employees said their uncertainty surfaced in August, when Apple and other companies erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and founder of the right-wing site Infowars — but Twitter did not. (Twitter only followed suit weeks later.) Saturday’s shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue led employees to urge Twitter’s leadership to firm up a policy on how to deal with hate speech and white supremacist content, two of the people said. Twitter did not address questions about its employee concerns on Monday, but said it needed to be “thoughtful and considered” in its policies. “Progress in this space is tough but we’ve never been as committed and as focused in our efforts,” Twitter said. “Serving public conversation and trying to make it healthier is our singular mission here.” Instagram, which was created as a site for people to share curated photos of their food, adorable pets and cute children, has largely avoided scrutiny over disinformation and hate content — especially when compared with its parent, Facebook. But social media researchers said that the site had over the last year become more of a hotbed for hateful posts and videos meant to provoke discord. That was evident after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, with the mushrooming of new anti-Semitic content on the site. On Sunday, one new video added to Instagram claimed that the state of Israel was created by the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish family. Underneath the video, the hashtags read #conspiracy and #jewworldorder. By late Monday, it had been viewed more than 1,640 times and shared to other social media sites, including Twitter and Facebook.",The New York Times
2018,"On Jamal Khashoggi Killing, Trump Administration Sends Mixed Signals","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, confronted with further evidence of a cover-up in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, veered on Monday between defending the value of its alliance with Saudi Arabia and pressing the Saudi government for answers. The White House sent the director of the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, to Istanbul to help the Turkish government with its investigation into the killing, according to an official. But in Riyadh, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held a wide-ranging meeting with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is suspected of playing a role in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident. Mr. Mnuchin, who canceled his attendance at this week’s Saudi investment conference in the wake of Mr. Khashoggi’s killing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, traded views with Prince Mohammed on economic ties and counterterrorism initiatives, as well as on the investigation into Mr. Khashoggi’s death, according to a Treasury Department spokesman. There are also fresh doubts about the Saudi government’s claim that Mr. Khashoggi was strangled accidentally after he got into a fist fight with 15 Saudi operatives, with video of a body double surfacing on Monday. A Saudi operative donned Mr. Khashoggi’s clothes after he was killed and left the building to create a misleading trail of evidence, surveillance images leaked by Turkey show. [The Turkish president says a team involved in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing included Saudi generals.] “I am not satisfied with what I have heard,” President Trump said to reporters before flying to a rally in Texas. But Mr. Trump reiterated the value of the $110 billion arms deal he announced with Saudi Arabia, as well as other American business ties with the kingdom. “I do not want to lose the investment being made in our country,” he said. The meeting between Mr. Mnuchin and Prince Mohammed was unplanned and came at the request of the Saudis, according to a person familiar with the situation. But it added to the portrait of a White House eager to move on from the killing of Mr. Khashoggi to a more routine relationship with its key Arab ally. The timing, as well as the unusual decision to send Ms. Haspel to Turkey, underscored that the furor was far from over. On Tuesday, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has promised to give a full, unvarnished account of what happened to Mr. Khashoggi. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has been the key contact with Prince Mohammed, likened the doubts about the truthfulness of Saudi officials to the run-of-the-mill perfidy that the White House deals with in Washington. “Every day we deal with people who are trying to deceive us in different ways,” Mr. Kushner said during a CNN forum in Manhattan. “But our job is to see through it, but also to stay focused on what’s best for the American people.” The administration has shifted its tone repeatedly on the Saudi response to the killing. But Mr. Trump has stopped short of pointing a finger at Prince Mohammed and has steadfastly defended the 33-year-old heir to the Saudi throne, whom the White House has cultivated and views as a critical partner in its efforts to isolate Iran. Mr. Mnuchin was the first senior American official to meet face to face with Prince Mohammed since the Saudi government confirmed on Friday that Mr. Khashoggi was killed. It had earlier insisted that he left the consulate and disappeared afterward. The Saudi Foreign Ministry lost no time in publicizing the session, posting a photograph on Twitter of Mr. Mnuchin sitting across from Prince Mohammed in an opulent reception room, listening while his host made a point. Prince Mohammed stressed “the importance of Saudi-US strategic partnership, where it holds an important role in the future in line with the Kingdom’s #Vision2030,” the tweet said, referring to the prince’s ambitious program to modernize his kingdom. A Treasury Department spokesman said the meeting was focused on combating terrorist financing and corralling Iran’s influences in the region and that the two men discussed the Khashoggi investigation. Mr. Mnuchin withdrew from speaking at an investor conference taking place this week in Riyadh because of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Khashoggi’s death but said he still planned to meet with Saudi officials to discuss economic issues and joint efforts to stop illicit terrorist financing. In an interview on Sunday in Jerusalem, Mr. Mnuchin said that Saudi Arabia needed to do more to demonstrate that Mr. Khashoggi’s killing was unintentional. But he defended his decision to travel to Riyadh and meet with Saudi officials, saying his trip was aimed at reinforcing ties at a critical moment, as the United States tries to ratchet up pressure on Iran. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who over the weekend said he believed Prince Mohammed was culpable in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, criticized Mr. Mnuchin’s decision to meet with the royal. “If their talks were about financial matters, I certainly think they should not have gone forward,” Mr. Schiff said in a telephone interview. “If they were about counterterrorism issues, it’s hard to believe how fruitful those could be.” The meeting occurred hours after Mr. Kushner said the White House was still engaged in “fact-finding” into Mr. Khashoggi’s death but that it had its “eyes wide open” as the investigations into his killing continued. The grounds for skepticism only seemed to deepen on Monday. The revelation that the Saudis deployed a body double added to the multiplying doubts about the Saudi explanation of how Mr. Khashoggi, 59, died. It suggested there was a premeditated plan to make Mr. Khashoggi disappear, through death or abduction, and to cover it up — possibly contradicting the Saudi insistence that his killing was the accidental result of an altercation. Mr. Trump, in an interview with USA Today, called it “a plot gone awry.” On Monday, CNN showed images, leaked by the Turkish authorities, that showed the body double strolling around Istanbul, apparently wearing Mr. Khashoggi’s clothes. The man was identified as Mustafa al-Madani, described in his now-deleted Facebook profile as a Saudi government engineer. Mr. Kushner, a key adviser on the Mideast peace process, has developed a strong relationship with the Saudi crown prince. He has talked to Prince Mohammed several times in the last week, and has come under criticism amid reports that he has advised Mr. Trump to wait before jumping to conclusions about Mr. Khashoggi’s death. “I think that, again, the president is focused on what’s good for America, what are strategic interests,” Mr. Kushner said. “Where do we share interests with other countries — let’s work toward those.” He made the remarks in his first televised interview since the 2016 election, conducted by the political activist Van Jones, at the “Citizen by CNN” forum in Manhattan. Mr. Kushner said that the president was mindful of getting answers, but he noted that the Saudis have been a strategic ally of the United States. When Mr. Jones noted that even Mr. Trump had said that there had been “deception” and “lies” from the Saudis in relation to the Khashoggi case, Mr. Kushner offered a more muted response. “We’re getting facts in from multiple places,” he said. “Once those facts come in, the secretary of state will work with our national security team to help us determine what we want to believe.” When Mr. Kushner was asked what advice he personally had given the crown prince, he replied, “To be transparent.” He added, “The world is watching.” Dismissing criticism of his ties to the crown prince, Mr. Kushner said he did not pay attention to his critics. At another point, he said he heeded criticism only if it was from someone he respected. An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. He is Mohammed bin Salman, not Salam.",The New York Times
2018,"On NBC, Megyn Kelly Does as Megyn Kelly Has Always Done","Critic’s Notebook Megyn Kelly, the vaunted and very expensive new addition to NBC’s morning, is gone — for now, and maybe for good — after saying that she didn’t see the big deal about white people wearing blackface. Who could have seen this coming, except for anyone who knew anything about her career? Kelly went on hiatus from “Megyn Kelly Today” on Thursday, after a Tuesday segment defending white people for wearing dark-pigmented makeup in Halloween costumes — a practice that has a demeaning history going back to the minstrel shows of the 19th century. To Kelly, this history was just a bummer, ruining an innocent good time. “What is racist?” she asked. “When I was a kid, that was O.K. as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character.” (Sidebar: I’m a few years older than Megyn Kelly, and it wasn’t. It’s also very much beside the point in 2018.) It was jaw-dropping. It was not, however, anything new for Kelly and race — or, for that matter, holidays. In a December 2013 segment of her old Fox News show about racial depictions of Santa Claus, she told “all you kids watching at home” that Santa was definitely white. (She said the same about Jesus, which at minimum is historically debatable.) This was hardly a career-ender at Fox News, where the “war on Christmas” and grievance over “political correctness” are built into the brand. Kelly also minimized reports of racist emails sent within the Ferguson, Mo., police department and, with other colleagues at Fox, sensationalized coverage of the fringe New Black Panther Party. That history was easy enough to find for anyone who was, say, considering signing a reported $17 million annual check for a new TV host. Now Kelly, like Roseanne Barr, who was fired by ABC over a racist tweet, may be on her way out. Which is telling, considering how she and Barr made their way in. [Update: ‘Megyn Kelly Today’ show is cancelled in wake of Kelly’s ‘Blackface’ comments.’] What brought Kelly to NBC may have been in part what brought “Roseanne” back to ABC — that dazed post-2016 state when media outlets, stunned by the election result, scrambled to make nice with Trump country. Kelly seemed to be a way to court that audience without seeming to outright pander. She had clashed as a debate moderator with then-candidate Donald J. Trump, who dismissed her questioning as “blood coming out of her wherever.” But she also had a history as one of the most lacerating talons of the Fox News eagle, and might bring over viewers who saw NBC as the liberal enemy. Whatever got her hired — displacing “Today’s Take,” the 9 a.m. show hosted by the black anchors Tamron Hall and Al Roker — it sure wasn’t an ability to be relaxed and conversational on morning TV, which she never demonstrated before “Megyn Kelly Today,” nor during it. And it was precisely one of these chatty morning-show segments that may have done her in. That may not be accidental. Both Kelly’s Santa and blackface comments came in off-the-cuff remarks in what seemed planned as “light” segments about holidays and celebrations — the sort of things that aren’t considered weighty news. But holidays are precisely the stuff of people’s deepest cultural identity and fondest memories of home and family. That’s why the annual freakout over Starbucks cups is a go-to for conservative media. And maybe that’s why these discussions can be more inadvertently revealing than people’s practiced responses to partisan issues. (Kelly has been more assiduously evenhanded on politics at NBC, while taking tough stances on the #MeToo movement, including the abuse accusations against the former “Today” host Matt Lauer.) Kelly’s panel on Tuesday was all white, which was a problem in itself. But it may also be why Kelly felt so comfortable making what — to her, apparently — was an entirely innocuous comment, much as she saw her Santa remarks. It is a pattern, and not an unfamiliar one. It’s the kind of remark that comes from people who don’t see themselves as racist. They just see themselves as, you know, normal. Regular. The default. They grew up in a world where these normal, regular, default things were — well, they were just the way things were. (“Santa just is white,” Kelly said in 2013, as if saying the sun rose in the east.) And they don’t get why people are so upset and sensitive now about what they see as harmless. It is, at heart, the reaction of people who didn’t have to think much about sharing the world with people different from them. They were never asked to learn much about those other people, or consider how their actions and speech and “harmless” entertainment might exclude or hurt them. Now people like Kelly are being asked to learn. And they’re puzzled, or irritated, or downright angry about it. Sometimes this feeling manifests itself in an offhand remark about Halloween. Sometimes it’s “Why should I have to say, ‘Happy holidays?’ ” Sometimes it’s tiki torches and “You will not replace us.” The degree is different. But it all comes back to: My thing used to be the main thing, the automatic thing, and now it’s not, and I don’t like it. That’s the animating force of much of Fox News’s programming, like Tucker Carlson’s prime-time culture war. But NBC has a broader audience and a different staff. In a striking public display Wednesday, Roker said that Kelly “owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country” and the anchor Craig Melvin said her words were “racist and ignorant.” It’s also possible that Kelly simply did not have good enough ratings to get away with this. It would not be the first time a TV network had done the right thing for the wrong reason. NBC knew Kelly’s Fox résumé, after all. It should have known that, in 2013, with the support of Fox and its audience, she dismissed her “Santa is white” critics for making a big deal about an “offhand jest” and proving that “Fox News and yours truly are big targets.” On Wednesday, with her colleagues condemning her, she apologized, her voice catching in her throat. “I have never been a P.C. person,” she said, “but I do understand the value of being sensitive to our history, particularly on race and ethnicity.” She followed that with a segment featuring the PBS host Amy Holmes and the journalist Roland Martin on the history of blackface and the white beauty standard, defined, as Martin put it, as “a white, blue-eyed, blonde woman.” It was a remarkable 13 minutes of Kelly — white, blue-eyed, blonde — sitting mostly silent, getting a public lesson from two black guests on her own racial obliviousness and that of many white Americans. I don’t pretend to read minds or hearts. Maybe Kelly truly sees this time that she said something wrong — as opposed to just unwise — and that she genuinely wants to learn, grow and change. People can do this. They should perhaps not be paid $17 million a year to do it. Maybe, when it comes to matters as basic as this, the learning part should come first.",The New York Times
2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Asked and Answered,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] You asked, we answer! Many of you responded to our call this week for questions about the midterms, 2020 and anything else on your mind. We picked a few to answer in today’s edition — and called in some friends to help. First, Tom Nicolson wondered: Will anyone challenge President Trump? Tom, there’s certainly a desire in some quarters of the Republican Party to find a primary challenger to President Trump. Last month, there were reports that the conservative commentator Bill Kristol was creating a “political war machine” to take on the president, an effort that included recruiting a candidate. One of his top picks? Nikki Haley. But she made very clear in her resignation this week that she would not be running in 2020. Some strategists took that as a confirmation of something they had already suspected: There’s little room to challenge Mr. Trump. Despite middling approval ratings, he’s kept a tight hold on his base — one that has only grown stronger since the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Of course, politics are unpredictable, particularly in this administration. But right now, it’s hard to see an electoral path for a credible Republican challenge. John Begley posed this question on one of the biggest races of the year: What is the likelihood that Beto will beat Cruz? Can he get out the Hispanic, minority and youth vote? To answer this one, we called in our resident Texas Senate expert, national politics reporter Matt Flegenheimer. He said: Beto O’Rourke started the race as a clear underdog, and he remains a clear underdog. But he’s done two things that few saw coming when the campaign began: draw enormous crowds and raise insane amounts of money. The trouble is, politicians have yet to discover a foolproof way to convert crowds and money into victory. And while his appeal with many young and nonwhite voters is clearly strong, it might not be enough. Take Hispanic voters. In our recent Times/Siena College poll, which showed Senator Ted Cruz up by eight points overall, Mr. O’Rourke led 56 percent to 37 percent with Hispanics. A solid lead, yes, but he will probably need a bigger margin — and spectacular turnout — from such voters to have a chance. Craig Scherfenberg asked: Who are the writers behind Trump’s speeches? And what do they know about the historical context in which they are operating? We threw Craig’s question to Julie Hirschfeld Davis, our intrepid White House correspondent. She told us: The backbone of President Trump’s speeches comes from Stephen Miller, his senior adviser in the White House. Mr. Miller used to be the one who would come out at Trump campaign rallies to warm up the crowd with a red-meat introduction. He liked to pair apocalyptic language about the state of the country with over-the-top praise of Mr. Trump, leaving the audience practically baying for the candidate. As the midterm campaign has heated up and Mr. Trump’s own re-election apparatus has taken shape, Brad Parscale, the 2020 campaign manager, has become more involved in the president’s remarks. Do they ponder the historical context of the words they’re giving Mr. Trump to say, or the impact on the country? I would be guessing. But there is no question that Mr. Miller — like his boss — likes the kind of divisive rhetoric that outrages progressives and thrills the base. And finally, Wendy Rosen sent us this, which is not really a question, but we wanted to address it anyhow: Please stop using “primary” as a verb. The world is falling apart but must our language sink to such low levels? Wendy, it can be a verb! (Editor Tom says: The Times is strict when it comes to language. But in this newsletter, we get to break some rules in order to sound more like, well, real people. We say us and you. We say optics and G.O.P. We use (gasp) contractions. And sometimes we use primary as a verb. But not always; today, you’ll be glad to know, I took it out of our answer to the first question.) You can email us anytime at onpolitics@nytimes.com.

We asked the reporter, Astead Herndon, to tell us a bit about his trip to Michigan that didn’t make it into the piece. Here’s what he sent us: Last Thursday I was at an event at a local Flint church, where Kaleka Lewis-Harris, a 42-year-old dynamo of a person, was directing a line of cars that stretched more than a mile. “Eight cases,” she called out to one of her volunteers, who was wearing a “Flint Lives Matter” T-shirt. The cars, of course, were waiting for bottled water, more than four years after the city’s supply was first contaminated. If you believe Gov. Rick Snyder, the Flint water crisis is effectively over, and the city’s state-issued water is safe to drink and use. But if you believe Flint residents, the same ones who first warned Mr. Snyder’s administration about the contamination, the progress has been pedestrian. About 80 percent of the city’s water service lines have been replaced, but some residents want the state to provide new indoor plumbing in their homes, improved water filters, and health care for previous health problems. Other residents said the issue is one of trust — and they just can’t imagine using Flint water again, under any conditions. Both the state’s candidates for governor — Gretchen Whitmer, the Democrat, and Bill Schuette, the Republican — have said they’d make fixing Flint’s water a priority. Still, residents, who have seen loads of politicians fail to deliver on such promises, are skeptical. “People are tired,” said David Brooks, a 72-year-old retired General Motors laborer. “It feels like this country just doesn’t care about you.” “My kids ask me what in the world is going on here, and I try to explain it, and they just don’t believe me,” said Louis Dinnan, a 60-year-old forklift driver. He was waiting in line to pick up bottled water distributed by Ms. Lewis-Harris and her volunteers. The good news is that the church had 30 pallets in total, provided by private companies and The United Way. The bad news: The state has ended its free bottled water distribution, and it’s unclear what residents will do once the private donations dry up. [Read Astead’s story on Flint here.] ____________________ Every so often, we like to tap the brain of our national political correspondent Jonathan Martin. No one knows political trivia — or where to find the best nosh on the campaign trail — better. This week, he sent us this: There is only one congressional district in North Dakota: It covers the entire state of North Dakota. Yes, NoDak, as some locals shorthand it, has one of the country’s seven at-large House districts. But while the population may be sparse, the food can be excellent, if one knows where to look. And when I was there last weekend to cover the Senate race, I figured out where to look. This being the Great Plains, where Midwest meets West, there’s plenty of bison. But there are also lesser-known local delicacies. For example, knoephla, a German-rooted dumpling soup. I had a cup at the Peacock Alley, a historic restaurant in Bismarck, and another at the very hip Hotel Donaldson in Fargo. Both spots were excellent, and the steak (beef or bison) was exquisite. If you’re still feeling in the mood for the Germanic, also check out Würst in Fargo for a bratwurst. But whatever you do, try to visit the state during the summer. I’ve been to North Dakota twice this year, in April and October, and there was snow on the ground both times. It was enough to make a guy hungry for dumpling soup.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Doing What She Can,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. “All I have to do is give my time.” It’s election season and Mary Rose Brown is awfully busy for a 92-year-old. The widowed former teacher spends her days writing postcards encouraging voters to head to the polls on Election Day. So far, she’s sent 650 pre-addressed, pre-stamped cards out across the country from her small apartment in an Iowa Falls, Iowa, assisted-living facility. “My goal is to send 1,000,” she told me over the phone. “I did 50 this morning.” When you ask voters to describe our current political climate, they’re likely to come back with a word like disgusted, angry or depressing. Heartwarming rarely comes up. But I’d like to suggest that there’s another way to see this moment: As a period of grass-roots democratic engagement. Bear with me for a minute. I know, it’s become fashionable to argue that the country is the most bitterly split since the Civil War. And yes, there’s truth to that. But we’re also engaged. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released over the weekend found that voter enthusiasm is up across the board from the last midterm contest in 2014. A 77 percent majority of registered voters told pollsters that they are certain to cast a ballot next month, up from 65 percent in October 2014. The finding is particularly striking given that midterms have traditionally only attracted a minority of voters. This political enthusiasm hasn’t always been pretty. There have been messy Thanksgiving dinners, P.T.A. meetings and church group discussions. But sometimes, through all the yelling, you find people like Ms. Brown. Born on a farm outside of Iowa Falls, she says she’s always been a proud Democrat. “I was raised a Democrats back in the 1930s, when my dad sat with his ear tuned into the radio listening to Roosevelt,” she said, speaking over a captioned phone. Her first job, she recalled, was connecting calls at a telephone office. Then she taught in a rural school, raised her four children and eventually opened her own income tax consulting business. She now has six grandchildren, ten great-grandchildren (with twins coming in December), and one great-great-granddaughter. In her retirement, she volunteered for AARP, coordinating a voter education program. Ms. Brown will be the first to admit that her postcards are partisan. They come as part of a program run by Tom Steyer, the billionaire Democratic activist. So far, the group has sent 1.5 million cards. But Ms. Brown says her bigger goal is to convince people that their vote matters. “What I am saying to the people on the postcards is, ‘Your vote will make a difference,’” she said. “I tell them my personal story, which is not very much. I’m a 92-years-young grandmother voting Democratic for a better future for all. Then, I just say thank you, please vote.” Ms. Brown is busy: She convinced a few of her friends at her assisted-living facility to help write some cards, and she’s also been collecting absentee ballot requests from others in her community. Will all that work matter on Election Day? Ms. Brown isn’t sure. But, she says, she has to try. “I do it because I firmly believe that I have some God-given blessing here that I’m able to do this in the first place,” she said. “I just have to be hopeful that at least a few will vote.” ____________________ Last night, President Trump was interviewed on the TV show “60 Minutes.” We asked James Poniewozik, the chief television critic for The Times, what he thought of the segment. Here’s what he told us: When Lesley Stahl sat down with President Trump on “60 Minutes,” they were in the same room. But they didn’t seem to think they were on the same show. Ms. Stahl believed she was doing a presidential interview, a ritual whose purpose is to press for information. From that traditional perspective, she did well enough. President Trump, on the other hand, saw the conversation the way he sees everything: as a competition. For him, it was an “Apprentice” boardroom. What matters in the boardroom is not to be accurate, or honest, or empathetic, but to dominate, assert, fight. There is no fact-checker in the boardroom. Here, Ms. Stahl took that role, following up and pushing back in a way Mr. Trump has mostly avoided by doing interviews in the greater “Fox”-verse. (Some things still got by, like an unsubstantiated claim that China meddled in the 2016 election.) At other times, Ms. Stahl and the president seemed like beings from different planets, trying to discuss alien concepts without a common language. She wondered what he would think about climate change if he saw the glaciers falling into the Arctic, though there is not a rich history of Mr. Trump being swayed by evidence. She asked if he had regrets. What are “regrets”? The impasse was most glaring when Ms. Stahl asked about the president’s mimicking of Christine Blasey Ford at a Mississippi rally. Was it necessary to make fun? Necessary? It was a moral question, the kind Mr. Trump has never shown much evidence of pondering. He asked, instead, if Ms. Stahl had seen “what’s gone on with the polls” since the Kavanaugh hearings. Sometimes it was as if Ms. Stahl were asking questions of a generic American president, one who cared about at least the appearance of higher principle. But the president who answered her was the one we actually have, for whom there is only one important and irrefutable retort. “It doesn’t matter,” he said, shutting down the questions about Dr. Blasey. “We won.” [Read more from James here.] ____________________ Senator Elizabeth Warren today released the results of a DNA test that she said indicated she had Native American ancestry. The news is yet another signal that Ms. Warren is all-but-officially running for president and trying to preemptively deal with expected lines of attack. Check out what she’s done over the past two months: • Released 10 years of tax returns. • Disclosed academic records indicating she did not use her ancestry to win preferential treatment as a law professor at Harvard University or the University of Pennsylvania. • Deployed staff to help with midterm races in early presidential primary states and key 2020 battlegrounds. Today’s release was complete with a polished political video interspersing interviews with Ms. Warren’s family with Republican attacks. Ms. Warren’s focus was ostensibly on Mr. Trump. But her release was aimed at assuaging concerns among Democrats worried about potential political vulnerabilities. Republicans pointed to Ms. Warren’s small percentage of Native American ancestry. The Boston Globe reported Ms. Warren is “between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American.” When asked by reporters this morning, Mr. Trump denied that he previously vowed to contribute $1 million to Ms. Warren’s favorite charity if she took a DNA test and it showed she had Native American roots. Ms. Warren tweeted in response: “Here’s something you won’t ‘forget,’ Mr. President: You’re the least popular president in modern history & your allies will go down hard in the midterm elections. 22 days. Tick-tock, tick-tock.” Asked again later in the day, Mr. Trump said that he would only donate the money if he could “test her personally.” He added, “That will not be something I enjoy doing, either.” Consider the exchange a preview of the next few years. ____________________ • In the years before abortion became legal, a clandestine group helped women with unwanted pregnancies get around the law.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Impeach Kavanaugh? Both Sides Are Up for the Fight,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] The day after Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation, frustrated and furious Democrats gathered in the back room of a sports bar in the Detroit suburbs. “The Republicans changed the way we think about the Supreme Court with Merrick Garland,” said Dan Reynolds, who works in the auto industry. “The gloves are off a little bit and, well, two can play at that game of politicizing the court.” His wife, Merrilee Reynolds, agreed: “The Democrats have been too nice. Too worried about being civil.” The couple was there for an event featuring many of the top Democratic candidates in Michigan, organized by Fems for Dems, a local Democratic women’s organization. Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation supersized their efforts, said Laurie Goldman, the founder of the group. Last week, around 50 people had signed up to attend. Over the weekend, the number ballooned to 250, with a 50-person waiting list. “I know they’re saying the other side is energized, but we were energized all along,” said Ms. Goldman, “and if you could have an ultrasonic energizing, that’s what happened to us now.” The story of this midterm election has been Democratic voters channeling their grievances into protests, calls to Congress, knocking on doors for candidates and — hope many in the party — the ballot box. But for some Democrats, taking control of the House, and maybe even the Senate, is only the beginning. If they win, they want their party to reopen the battle over Justice Kavanaugh’s seat on the court. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat in line to be the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has said that if Democrats win control, he will open an investigation into charges of sexual misconduct and perjury against Justice Kavanaugh. Not all Democrats agree with the idea: “Talking about it at this point isn’t necessarily healing us and moving us forward,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware told NBC over the weekend. Privately, some Democrats say a robust effort against Justice Kavanaugh is doubtful — mainly because other targets, like the White House, are expected to be the party’s priority. Even if Democrats proceed, it is unlikely they would be able to remove Justice Kavanaugh from the court. There is a process to impeach and remove a judge, but it’s largely been used in lower courts. Like presidential impeachment, a majority of the House must approve an indictment to impeach, and two-thirds of the Senate must convict the judge or justice. Samuel Chase is the only United States Supreme Court justice ever to face the proceeding; he was acquitted by the Senate in 1805. Republicans, for their part, love the idea of a Kavanaugh investigation — at least politically. They believe promises like Mr. Nadler’s will mobilize their base, helping them to combat the wave of Democratic enthusiasm. They’ve been warning about the investigations that will come if the “angry mob” takes over Congress. It’s the Steve Bannon theory of politics: forget about independents — just try and mobilize the 40 percent of the public who have stuck with President Trump. “Republicans, they feel like a man who has, at least as an adult, led an exemplary life is being slandered for things that may or may not have happened,” said the Republican pollster Whit Ayers. But oppositional anger, even if unlikely to result in actual policy, can be a powerful force in politics. Tea Party activists rode the emotion to victory in 2010 and President Trump in 2016. Democrats hope to do the same this year. “We’ve got so many people to investigate and impeach,” said Kathie Fritz, as she listened to the Democrats deliver their stump speeches. “At some point, we just have to join together as Democrats to win the House.” ____________________ There were a lot of theories surrounding this morning’s surprise resignation of Nikki R. Haley, President Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. She needs money to send her two children to college! There’s a looming ethics scandal! She’s running for president! But one thing was glaringly obvious: Ms. Haley is a shrewd politician. A Trump opponent in the primary, she was able to win an administration post that made her the highest-profile woman in the cabinet. At times she openly disagreed with the administration. But she faced few consequences. Last December, Ms. Haley said that women who had accused Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct “should be heard, and they should be dealt with,” breaking with the administration’s longstanding insistence that the allegations were false. Then there was the time a White House official described her as having “momentary confusion,” after she said publicly that the administration would be imposing sanctions on Russia. Ms. Haley replied that she did not “get confused.” Despite his known intolerance for criticism, Mr. Trump stayed silent. When she decided it was time to leave, Ms. Haley left with a splash: a televised press event with the president, where he dubbed her “glamorous” — high praise from a man known to seek officials who look like they could play the part. She leaves having pulled off a hat trick, one that’s been very challenging for most Republicans in the Trump era: She’s kept the loyalty of Mr. Trump without losing the support of more moderate Republicans and G.O.P. donors. In her resignation letter, Ms. Haley did not mince words: “I will surely not be a candidate for any office in 2020.” The declaration makes clear what nearly all Republican operatives already know. Right now, there’s no real path for a Republican to successfully primary the president. Ms. Haley certainly knows that, too. But, notice, she didn’t mention 2024.

We were curious about what steps our politicians could take right now that would have an impact. So we asked John Schwartz, who covers climate change for The Times. Here’s what he told us: The science that proves climate change is happening and that humans are causing it is overwhelming, and the new report from a United Nations science panel shows the urgency of the problem. What to do about it? There’s way less certainty there. It has become clear that there is no silver bullet when it comes to cutting greenhouse gases, but there are things governments can do that would help. Those include: • Promoting renewable energy (and the business opportunities that it brings). • Ending our dependence on coal for generating power. • Reducing vehicle emissions. Government also has a role to play in boosting the development of technologies that can remove carbon dioxide from smokestacks at power plants and manufacturing plants, and reducing other greenhouse gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons. And if you want to start an argument, bring up nuclear energy; a number of climate scientists, including James Hansen, say it is an essential part of the greenhouse solution, while others are unconvinced that nuclear power can be made safe, not to mention the still-unsolved problem of what to do with the waste. (You can find many more possible solutions in books like “Drawdown” by Paul Hawken.) All of these actions, worthy as they may be, however, require a government that understands the threat of climate change and the need for action. The current administration has headed in the opposite direction on nearly every one of these fronts. Read John’s latest story, on how FEMA spends billions to rebuild without accounting for climate change. ____________________ An upcoming event On Politics readers may be interested in: Tomorrow, Oct. 10, Alex Burns, national political correspondent, will lead a conversation with his Times colleagues about the midterm elections, President Trump and the state of politics.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Inside Murkowski’s Vote on Kavanaugh,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Senator Lisa Murkowski didn’t say much. She mostly listened, as the group of women gathered in her office shared their stories of sexual violence. When Ms. Murkowski spoke, said Hilary Morgan, a consultant from Anchorage, it was to tell the women how her “heart had been breaking” for the last two weeks. “She said she’s probably six inches shorter because of the weight of everything,” said Ms. Morgan, who was part of that group of women, 130 in all, who had flown 15 hours from Alaska to Washington with less than a day’s notice to meet with their senator. This morning, Ms. Murkowski voted no on advancing the confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She was the lone Republican to oppose him. That’s not enough to derail his path to the court, which was essentially guaranteed this afternoon. But her vote makes a strong statement — both about Ms. Murkowski and our current political climate. It’s easy to forget how hard it is to be an independent in Washington. Now, more than ever, this is a town with two teams. Our national mavericks — figures like Senator John McCain or Justice Anthony Kennedy — have mostly vanished. But if they have an heir, it may just be the female senator from Alaska. Her critiques of the president steal the spotlight less often than those of Senators Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse. But she’s also more likely to actually vote against the administration, particularly when it would help Alaska. She opposed a Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act because of threatened Medicaid cuts, and was against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary because of risks to rural school budgets. Yes, those votes are outliers: She has also voted for a number of the administration’s priorities, including the tax bill. But they’re more opposition than nearly any other Republican senator, including Mr. Flake and Mr. Sasse, has shown during the Trump administration. Ms. Murkowski doesn’t spend a lot of time worrying about being out of step with her party, says Andrew Halcro, an old friend who served with her in the Alaska Legislature. “If history is any indicator, she’ll just shrug it off and continue to do her job,” he said. “Every time I’ve seen Lisa Murkowski take a tough vote for the last 20 years, her decisions have always come down to people, not politics.” If Ms. Murkowski is unique, perhaps it’s because her home state’s politics are unlike any other’s. Her father, former Senator Frank Murkowski, appointed her to the Senate in 2002 when he became the state’s governor. (She was picked over an up-and-coming mayor from Wasilla, Sarah Palin.) Eight years later, Ms. Palin backed another Republican, Joe Miller, who defeated Ms. Murkowski in the primary. Against the wishes of party leaders, Ms. Murkowski launched a write-in campaign. She won the election, largely thanks to the backing of women and Alaska Natives — an unusual coalition for a Republican. Ms. Murkowski told reporters that she returned to the Senate with a “stiffer, straighter” spine. Republicans today were quick to condemn Ms. Murkowski’s vote on Judge Kavanaugh. (Even Ms. Palin chimed in.) “There will be long-term resentment among Republican voters due to Senator Murkowski’s lack of courage today,” said Penny Nance, president of the conservative group Concerned Women for America. “Conservative women never forget.” Their remarks line up with those of national Republicans, who, polls show, strongly back Judge Kavanaugh. But, as always, politics in Alaska are a different story. The state has the highest rate of sexual assault in the country, according to the F.B.I., and the rate is particularly high among Native women. That’s a fact Ms. Murkowski knows well: This summer she introduced two pieces of bipartisan legislation to end sex trafficking among Native Americans and to improve critical care among the victims of sexual violence. Issues of sexual violence clearly weighed on Ms. Murkowski during her vote today. Judge Kavanaugh, she said in remarks to reporters outside the Senate chamber, is “a good man.” But, she added, “if people who are victims, people who feel that there is no fairness in our system of government, particularly in our courts, then you’ve gone down a path that is not good and right.” “We’re dealing with issues right now that are bigger than the nominee.” ____________________ A remark by the Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, caught our eye today, as we track how the campaigns are responding to the Kavanaugh confirmation. Mr. Bredesen released a statement saying that if he were in the Senate, he would support Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. He followed up with an ad proclaiming his political independence. Of the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, he said: “I don’t even support him.” His stance cost him the backing of a top Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA Action. (They had not yet put any money into his race.) It’s a political play that makes a lot of sense: Mr. Bredesen is running a tight race in a red state. He needs to win independents and disaffected Republicans. For a Democrat in Tennessee, publicly losing national Democratic support might be better than having it. [Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every evening.] ____________________ I spent the morning on Capitol Hill, observing all the chaos around today’s historic vote. People packed themselves into the offices of senators (including Joe Manchin’s, above). Everywhere Ms. Murkowski went, she was trailed by reporters. And outside the Capitol, the streets were flooded with protesters, many of whom were arrested. ____________________ Hillary Clinton is coming to Broadway. No, she’s not doing a one-woman show. She will be the main character (played by Laurie Metcalf) in the new drama “Hillary and Clinton,” which depicts a 2008 evening in which the presidential candidate, struggling in Iowa against a more charismatic opponent, calls on her husband for help. We thought it was a good time to pick the brain of The Times’s theater reporter, Michael Paulson, about some of his favorite plays starring real political figures. Here’s what he sent us: There are so many! But here are five that come to mind, in reverse chronological order: • “Hamilton,” obviously — the 2015 musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda, which features George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and, of course, Aaron Burr, in addition to the title character, Alexander Hamilton. Plus, periodically wandering in from across the ocean: King George. • “All the Way,” the 2014 play about L.B.J., written by Robert Schenkkan. • “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” a 2010 musical by Alex Timbers and Michael Friedman. You can guess who it’s about. • “Assassins,” a 1990 musical, by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman, about the men and women who have tried to kill various U.S. presidents. • “Fiorello!”, a 1959 musical, with a book by Jerome Weidman and George Abbott and songs by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock, about the three-term New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. Read Michael’s story on “Hillary and Clinton” here. ____________________ • 2018 is set to be the best year for the United States economy in quite a long time.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Jeff Flake’s #Me Moment,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] “What does it feel like to be a man without a country?” That was the question posed to Senator Jeff Flake on Monday, three days after he infuriated many fellow Republicans by delaying Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation proceedings by insisting on an F.B.I. investigation as a condition for his support. Since then, Mr. Flake has been making the rounds, popping up on “60 Minutes,” in print interviews and on a panel at a Forbes conference in Boston. Tonight, he’s speaking at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., a traditional stop for presidential candidates — a possibility he has not ruled out. Given that Mr. Flake was cornered by emotional victims of sexual assault last week, you might think he wants to talk about Judge Kavanaugh’s qualifications. Or you might think he has something to say about sexual violence. But this is definitely not about #MeToo. It’s more like #Me. For the past two years, Mr. Flake has been a man on an island. He infuriates conservatives with his constant sniping at President Trump, which included writing a book bemoaning how he thinks the administration has compromised the Republican Party. But he almost always votes with the administration (83.6 percent of the time, according to data collected by FiveThirtyEight), irritating Democrats. Take his comments on Judge Kavanaugh: “I’m a conservative. He’s a conservative. I plan to support him unless they turn up something — and they might.” People who know Mr. Flake say his critique is less about ideology than political style. “He’s not a moderate. He’s still arguing for his conservatives beliefs, but he’s always been of the opinion that you can do that in a cordial way,” said Jaime Molera, a Republican strategist who’s friendly with the senator. Voters, though, have not exactly been crying out for comity: Mr. Flake opted out of running for re-election last fall after watching his approval ratings crater. Now, he sees a fresh opportunity to push his message. In his comments this weekend, he decried the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. He fretted about the damage the divisive battle is doing to institutions like the Supreme Court. And he claimed there are Republicans seeking a different kind of politics than those of the Trump administration. “They see the policies that come out of the White House and say, ‘Where is our party?’” he said, in Boston. “They’re looking, yearning for a more decent politics. Stand for your principles, yes, but understand compromise isn’t a dirty word.” The question is, where, exactly, are all these longing Republicans? There certainly weren’t enough of them to defeat Mr. Trump in the 2016 primary. Nor were there enough in the many races this year where Mr. Trump’s candidates beat out the establishment picks. Republicans quickly realized that the way to win a primary in 2018 was by aligning yourself with the White House, not against it. And while the numbers have dropped a bit in recent weeks, the vast majority of Republican voters — near 80 percent — say they still approve of the president. Mr. Flake knows this. Perhaps his most revealing statement about the confirmation hearings came when he admitted that he never would have moved to delay the vote if he were running for a second term. “There’s no value to reaching across the aisle,” said Mr. Flake on Sunday night. “There’s no currency for that anymore.” ____________________ This weekend, Caitlin Dickerson, a national immigration reporter for The Times, broke a story about 1,600 migrant children who have been sent to a tent city in Texas. Today she sent us this, on the politics of immigration: Despite all the news about the F.B.I. investigation into the man who may become our next Supreme Court justice, a surprising number of readers latched onto the details in my story about migrant children being moved to Texas: Massive tents on a barren patch of land. Portable toilets. No schooling. Limited legal access. The children are headed to the tent city because the shelters that typically house them are overflowing. This story is one of several that I’ve written about underage border crossers (some of whom were separated from their parents) that seemed to strike a chord with readers across the political spectrum, which raises the question: Will the strong feelings of voters, both Republican and Democrat, about this issue somehow translate into the midterms? I reached out to Amanda Cox, editor of The Upshot and one of our resident experts on polling. She told me that as recently as last week, both liberal and conservative voters signaled that immigration was indeed very important to them. As part of The Upshot’s Live Polls project, The Times has done some of its own polling on the finer points of immigration, which, Amanda explained, has revealed some unexpected views in battleground districts. “Abolishing I.C.E. was not popular at all, and support for building a wall was mixed, but not great,” she said. A couple of things she found surprising: • A strong majority in these battleground districts said illegal immigrants living in the United States are not more likely than American citizens to commit serious crimes. • A very strong majority said that it doesn’t bother them to hear immigrants speak a foreign language in a public place. She had not expected voters to be quite so tolerant, she said, since polls had previously found “much higher support for people saying discrimination against whites had become as big of a problem as that against blacks and other minorities.” Read Caitlin’s story: Migrant Children Moved Under Cover of Darkness to a Texas Tent City ____________________ It’s hard to believe it’s taken us this long (how long have we been doing this newsletter? Three weeks? Three years?) to talk about the next presidential election. But, after a weekend full of speculation, it’s finally time. Introducing … 2020 WATCH. Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered perhaps the strongest announcement any major candidate has made yet, saying on Saturday, “After Nov. 6, I will take a hard look at running for president.” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been “actively exploring” a presidential run, our own Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin write — though his role in Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearings is complicating his plans. And Michael Avenatti, the Democratic lawyer who’s taken up residence in cable news green rooms, said he’s “seriously considering” a presidential bid at the Texas Tribune annual policy conference this weekend. Also at the conference: Senator Jeff Merkley told the Nevada Independent’s Jon Ralston that he’s “exploring very seriously” the possibility of a presidential run in 2020. “It’s something I’m thinking about,” said Eric Holder, the former attorney general. Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, would say only, “I’m not running today.” Even John Kerry refused to rule it out, saying: “I’m not thinking about it right now. I have too much work to do.” Makes you wonder: Are there any Democrats not considering running for president?

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Midterm Conspiracies,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] The 2016 election was a perfect storm for conspiracy theories. On one side of the race there was a Republican nominee known for peddling conspiracies, most famously that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States. On the other side was a Democrat whose family had spawned a cottage industry of sordid tales. I’m sure you remember the highlights: John F. Kennedy assassins, seizures covered up by the Secret Service, Manchurian candidates, child trafficking centers masquerading as D.C. pizza joints, etc. At one point, it felt like everyone involved in that election had gotten caught up in some kind of conspiracy theory. (Including me!) I was reminded of that craziness this week, after The Washington Times retracted and apologized for a column about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staff member whose unsolved killing in 2016 sparked conspiracy theories. Though the police believe Mr. Rich may have been killed in a botched robbery effort, many figures on the right — including Sean Hannity — have connected the death to the leak of D.N.C. emails. These days, removed from the din of a presidential election, it does seem as though we’re hearing less about those kinds of theories. But they certainly haven’t gone away (see: QAnon). To find out what’s circulating right now on the dark corners of the internet, we reached out to the technology columnist Kevin Roose, our resident conspiracy theory expert and one of the people working on The Times’s effort to identify political disinformation. Here’s what he told us: Two high-profile progressive insurgents — Beto O’Rourke in Texas and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York — have both been on the receiving end of what I call the “4chan background check,” which is an attempt, led by amateur sleuths on 4chan, 8chan, Reddit and other questionable internet forums, to dig up damning information on a candidate, no matter how inaccurate. One particularly dumb conspiracy theory involving Mr. O’Rourke is that he changed his name from Robert to “Beto” in order to ingratiate himself with Latino voters. In fact, he has gone by Beto since long before he entered politics, as he showed by tweeting a photo of himself as a young child with “BETO” stitched on his sweater. Still, the conspiracy persists. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has had a flurry of misinformation thrown at her, too, including claims made by conservative writers that she grew up in a fancy suburban home despite her story of working-class roots in the Bronx. The tweet that accompanied many of these accusations showed a small, modest house in nearby Yorktown Heights — not some sprawling McMansion. (The guy who dug up that photo also falsely claimed that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had attended Brown University. She went to Boston University. So close!) But my personal favorite midterms conspiracy theory, even though technically it’s more of a midterms-adjacent conspiracy theory, is that the woman who testified in front of the Senate last week wasn’t actually Christine Blasey Ford. According to some on Twitter, it was actually the actress Amy Schumer, wearing makeup and glasses. It’s wild out there, folks! If you spot a piece of political disinformation online, let us know. ____________________ The billionaire investor and Democratic activist Tom Steyer is directing his political operation to get involved in five additional House races in Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All five districts — Florida’s 15th, Florida’s 16th, Florida’s 25th, Pennsylvania’s 16th and Wisconsin’s Sixth — are considered Republican-leaning. Mr. Steyer’s investment is a sign that Democrats see opportunities to tilt those districts. Worth noting: They’re all in battleground presidential states, places where building out an operation of fired-up Democratic volunteers could pay long-term dividends. (Mr. Steyer himself hasn’t ruled out a presidential bid.) He has committed to spending $120 million to help Democrats win the House — more than any other individual in Democratic politics. His sizable political operation includes efforts to engage young voters, promote clean energy and impeach President Trump.

Ahead of the midterms, he’s going to be sending messages to readers’ phones, and readers can respond back. You can ask him questions! Send him emojis! Maybe even send him bitmoijis! (Is that still a thing?) I had some questions about the project. So I texted him. Alex will be at an event for Senator Bernie Sanders in Washington tonight. Sign up here for updates on his travels, and thoughts, ahead of the election. ____________________ This afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a rare appearance in the White House briefing room, delivering her first press briefing since Sept. 10. (The briefings, an almost-daily occurrence in previous administrations, have nearly vanished in the Trump era.) Here were the highlights: Most of the questions were Kavanaugh-related. The confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh is the biggest story in Washington, and President Trump’s rally last night — in which he mocked Christine Blasey Ford — is still reverberating. Ms. Sanders’s answers revealed bit of the president’s strategy in framing the issue. On who is to blame: “This entire process has been a disgrace, and the only reason that it’s been that way is because Senate Democrats didn’t do this the way that it should have been done and they circumvented the entire system. And, frankly, they’ve undermined our entire judicial branch.” On who the victims are: “I think both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh are victims at the hands of the Democrats.” On last night’s rally: “The president was stating facts.” (By our count, she used the word “facts” 19 times in discussing the nomination.) She was no fan of The Times’s investigation. “I’m not going to sit and go through every single line of a very boring 14,000-word story,” she said, when asked about the 18-month investigative project The Times debuted yesterday, which uncovered a history of tax fraud in the Trump family business. She did not list any details that were inaccurate. And about those tax returns... Reporter: “Are the president’s taxes still under audit?” Ms. Sanders: “I know that a number of his taxes are still under audit.” Reporter: “Are those ones from the ’90s and early 2000s, are those as well?” Ms. Sanders: “I’d have to check and get back to you.” Reporter: “Would the White House be willing to provide any of his tax returns?” Ms. Sanders: “I’m not aware of any plans to do so.” ____________________ • The Times collected remarkable images of the devastation left by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Reality Check,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] We’re going to start this evening by using our imaginations. So take a seat in the sharing circle and pretend that today, Oct. 4, is Election Day. On Capitol Hill, Republicans are cautiously optimistic, sensing they’re just a day or so away from confirming Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Republican voters, outraged by the treatment of their nominee in Congress, are more fired up than they’ve been since the midterms began. They flock to the polls, eager to defend their majority. Democratic voters are out in droves, too. But the toughest Senate races are being fought in states that President Trump won in 2016. So things are looking bleak for incumbents like Heidi Heitkamp, Claire McCaskill and even Jon Tester. That’s the image many Republicans were painting of the midterms this morning. But here’s the thing (and it’s a biggie): Today is not Election Day. You probably didn’t need The New York Times to tell you that. But hear me out — the timing of this whole confirmation battle matters for the midterms. A lot. Pollsters often measure intensity — or how excited people are to vote — by asking them to rate their eagerness on a scale of 1 to 10. Before Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation became so contentious, Republicans told me they were seeing a 12- to 15-point gap between Democrats and Republicans who said they were a 10 on the scale. Yikes. Republicans kept waiting for that gap to tighten, as is expected as Election Day nears. But it wasn’t happening, and that was freaking them out. Now, finally, the gap has closed. A poll from NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist released yesterday found almost no difference in the percentage of Republicans and Democrats who say voting in the November elections is “very important.” The party has unified. Republicans are thrilled. So is President Trump. But you know who else is fired up by the confirmation battle? Democrats — particularly the independents and women who are considered crucial voters in battleground suburban counties. The question is not who is angrier today. The question is whose anger lasts until Election Day. Here’s another principle in politics: Losers are easier to motivate than winners. “Every last Democrat in the country is going to come out if he gets confirmed,” said Whit Ayres, a prominent Republican pollster, of Judge Kavanaugh. Even with that energy, a Democratic sweep is by no means guaranteed. Typically, independents are less likely to vote than people affiliated with parties. Republicans generally turn out in higher numbers for midterms than Democrats. And in a handful of states with early voting, some people are casting ballots right now. But for most Americans, there are 33 days to get through before they enter a voting booth. “Election Day is several lifetimes away in the world we’re living in now,” Mr. Ayres said. “It’s entirely possible that the Kavanaugh nomination and confirmation could be a distant memory by then.” ____________________ After Senator Jeff Flake’s much-publicized push for an F.B.I. investigation of Judge Kavanaugh last Friday — and our less-than-impressed reaction to it — I was curious to see what voters in his home state thought. Fortunately, Mike Noble, chief pollster and managing partner of Phoenix-based OH Predictive Insights, had an answer. He partnered with the local Arizona station ABC15 to survey 600 likely Arizona voters on Monday and Tuesday. The result: Mr. Flake is upside-down with his own party. Only 20 percent of Republicans said they had a favorable view of Mr. Flake. That compared with 43 percent of independents and 59 percent of Democrats. Overall, only 38 percent of Arizona voters said they approved of Mr. Flake. “Based on our latest poll,” Mr. Noble said, “Flake is a man without a party.” [Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every evening.] ____________________ Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat who voted in support of Justice Neil Gorsuch and is now facing a tough re-election campaign, said today that she will vote against Judge Kavanaugh. “In addition to the concerns about his past conduct, last Thursday’s hearing called into question Judge Kavanaugh’s current temperament, honesty, and impartiality. These are critical traits for any nominee to serve on the highest court in our country.” She faulted both Democrats and Republicans for mishandling the confirmation. “We live in a very divisive time, but we can change that. Both sides horribly handled the process around this nomination. We must learn from these mistakes.” Expect more of that argument from candidates in close races, who are hearing from voters outraged by how this confirmation was handled. ____________________ From time to time, we like to peek over the wall that separates news and opinion at The Times and ask the Opinion politics editors what they’ve been working on lately. Today they sent us this: The opinion pages remain firmly in the grip of Kavanaugh fever. This week, his temperament — especially his perceived anger — has come under intense fire. More than 1,700 law professors felt compelled to tell senators that they should not confirm Judge Kavanaugh because he “displayed a lack of judicial temperament that would be disqualifying” for elevation to the Supreme Court. (They first shared their letter with The Times, and will present it to the Senate today.) One signee of that letter, Laurence Tribe, wrote in a separate Op-Ed that it goes beyond his temperament to questions of recusal: Judge Kavanaugh would be disqualified “from participating in a wide range of the cases that may come before the Supreme Court” involving individuals or groups that he has singled out “as implacable adversaries.” The past two weeks have produced moments of intense strangeness, like the one experienced by our columnist Bret Stephens. “For the first time since Donald Trump entered the political fray,” he wrote, “I find myself grateful that he’s in it” because “Trump has not backed down in the face of the slipperiness, hypocrisy and dangerous standard-setting” by opponents of Judge Kavanaugh. In The Conversation, Frank Bruni and Ross Douthat also shared a surprise — at the extent of Mr. Trump’s uncharacteristic restraint — and looked ahead to the midterms. Tom Edsall took a deep dive into the stakes for Mr. Trump in this election, which will “determine whether the regulatory decisions of executive branch agencies” are subject to “critical review.” Desperate to ignore Washington? The writer Gracy Olmstead, an Idaho native, talked with the legendary writer, essayist and farmer Wendell Berry on American farming. The real problems of agriculture, Mr. Berry said, can be summed up as “the triumph of industrialism and industrial values over the lives of living creatures, and over the life of the living world.” You can find more opinion pieces on politics here. ____________________ • Four years ago, a Chicago police officer shot and killed an unarmed teenager.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: They’re Running? Not Yet. (But Yes.),"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] With the confirmation battle of Justice Brett Kavanaugh finally over, we got a preview of our political future. Spoiler alert: It’s exhausting. A whole lot of Democrats are meeting voters, campaigning in key states, posing for photos with some of the buzziest midterm candidates, and definitely, most certainly, under absolutely no circumstances RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. Our fearless leader Patrick Healy, The Times’s politics editor, says this week reminds him of a moment in everyone’s favorite musical, “Hamilton.” Right after Alexander Hamilton finishes a quiet ballad about his son’s death, Thomas Jefferson jumps onto the stage. “Can we get back to politics?” he whines. Then it’s off to the election of 1800. (Can you tell Pat used to cover theater?) So, yeah, this week has been kind of like that. No one is officially “running for president.” But everyone is running. Take President Trump. This week, he’s holding rallies in four states. The stops are for candidates running in 2018. But they’re also a down payment for 2020. “I’m not on the ballot,” Mr. Trump said in Southaven, Miss., last week. “But in a certain way, I’m on the ballot. So, please go out and vote.” Also on the Republican side, Nikki Haley made very clear yesterday that she would not be running against the president in 2020. She’s known as a savvy political operator. If she’s not running, it’s a strong indicator that there isn’t a realistic opening for a Republican to primary the president. (Sorry, Bill Kristol!) On the Democratic side, well, it’s crowded. Already. Here’s some of what has happened over the past four days: • Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has said she plans to “take a hard look” at running for president, campaigned with Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, yesterday. • Senator Bernie Sanders delivered his second major foreign-policy speech on Tuesday, with a call to fight global right-wing populism. (His lack of foreign policy experience was a weakness in 2016.) Later this month, he’ll make campaign stops in nine states. • Former Vice President Joe Biden played coy with CNN at an event in London, saying he’s not running for president “at this point.” He’s headed to Kentucky and Indiana later this week. • Senator Kamala Harris campaigned in Ohio, where she said she will “seriously take a look at” 2020 after the November elections. She’s headed to South Carolina next week. • Senator Kirsten Gillibrand campaigned for some of the candidates endorsed by her PAC, “Off the Sidelines,” plowing through Tennessee, Michigan and Georgia. Her organization has distributed millions of dollars to female candidates. Not a bad way to make the kinds of friends you need for a presidential bid. • Senator Cory Booker swung through Iowa. The trip included a high-profile speech at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Fall Gala. • Michael Bloomberg announced on social media that he’s re-registered as a Democrat. He told our Alex Burns last month that if he runs in 2020, it will be on the Democratic ticket. • An enraged Tom Steyer, the Democratic super-donor, told us in an interview that the U.N. climate report left him with no tolerance for “Republicans lying on the most basic issues for political gain.” He said he’ll make a decision about a 2020 run after the midterms. • And Michael Avenatti, the liberal lawyer and Trump administration antagonist, proposed a three-round mixed martial arts fight with Donald Trump Jr. Really. Only 25 more months of this. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. ____________________ What do you want to know about the midterms? Or 2020? Send your questions to onpolitics@nytimes.com. We plan to answer some later this week. (And if we don’t know the answer, we’ll find someone who does.) ____________________ Our Miami bureau chief, Patricia Mazzei, is part of The Times’s team covering Hurricane Michael. We called her today to ask about the politics of storms in a state that’s seen plenty of them. Lisa: As we talk, the storm is slamming into the Florida panhandle. Where are you right now? Patricia: I am in Tallahassee, in a hotel pretty close to the State Capitol. We try to bracket hurricanes. You try to send someone to one side of the storm and someone to the other, so you’re in a good position to get to the places that are affected. This hotel has buried power lines, which is unusual, but it’s because they’re very close to the State Capitol. So it hasn’t lost power. It lost TV, and the lights have been flickering for a few hours. But so far it hasn’t lost power. So, from your story this morning, it sounds like Gov. Rick Scott is a pro at storm politics. I came to this having written a story during the presidential campaign about Jeb Bush having cemented his reputation as a hurricane governor. I think Rick Scott has, in some ways, followed in Bush’s footsteps, in that he is very present and very visible and is the one giving people all the messages and information. There’s just no substitute for that. How much does that matter in Florida? Are races won or lost based on hurricanes? They could, because the races here tend to be so close. The timing of this storm is interesting because absentee ballots, mail-in ballots went out a week ago. This is the crucial last few weeks, when people make up their minds. It’s that sweet spot when people start paying attention. Because it’s campaign season, there are attack ads during the hurricane, and there’s a whole spat over whether they should be up. They can’t really fight over anything else while people are dealing with the rain and the wind. In your story, you mention how Mr. Scott shows up in “disaster casual” — a button-down shirt and a baseball cap that reads “NAVY.” Is that a thing in Florida politics? Oh, definitely. Even in local politics. During Irma, Representative Carlos Curbelo showed up at one of the briefings with a windbreaker. It was not raining yet, but he was there with the windbreaker. So, what’s your disaster casual? I’m not that original, I have to say. I have hiking boots, some tall rain boots, khakis, one of those button-down quick-drying Columbia shirts, a rain coat and a New York Times hat. Got to represent the brand! Thanks so much for talking to us. Stay safe out there! [Read Patricia’s story on Gov. Rick Scott, and follow our coverage of the storm here.] ____________________ We often ask our colleagues around the country to tell us about the political stories happening in their worlds. Today, Nick Corasaniti, who covers New Jersey, sent us this dispatch: Tune into Thursday night’s showdown between the Giants and Eagles and you may wonder why Martin Shkreli, the so-called “Pharma Bro” who raised the price of lifesaving drug by 5,500 percent overnight, is appearing in a political ad. And you might also wonder why we’re focusing on a singular ad from a singular race here in this newsletter. Well, the Senate race in New Jersey is growing increasingly contentious, and contested, between Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, and Bob Hugin, his Republican challenger and a former pharmaceutical executive. It’s worth keeping an eye on. Central to the race has been nasty accusations of pharmaceutical impropriety, coming from both campaigns. Mr. Hugin’s tenure as C.E.O. of Celgene, the pharmaceutical company that makes a lifesaving cancer drug, Revlimid, has become a frequent target of Mr. Menendez’s. The company has some red flags in its past, including accusations of raising the price of Revlimid to shore up other failures. Mr. Hugin’s campaign has countered, trying to tie the Medicare fraud conviction of Salomon Melgen, Mr. Menendez’s close friend and co-defendant in his public corruption trial, directly to the senator. It’s caustic campaigning from both sides, though also a woefully complex issue and industry. So, insert the “Pharma Bro-Pharma C.E.O.” comparison in the ad, which was produced by the super PAC Patients for Affordable Drugs Action. To be sure, the analogy is not exactly clean. Mr. Shkreli, for one, was sentenced to prison because of financial crimes, not raising drug prices. And his company raising the price of a 62-year-old drug it had acquired to $750 a pill from $13.50 overnight is far different from Celgene raising the price of a drug it developed from $6,000 a month in 2006 to $16,000 a month in 2017. But as this race stays tight, expect the aggressive and confrontational ads to continue. This is, after all, New Jersey.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: War of the Sexes,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] The fight over Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was supposed to be about a seat on the Supreme Court. But the past two weeks have transformed that discrete political battle into something far larger: A simmering war of the sexes that’s deepening the divide between Democratic women and Republican men. These are tensions that have been mounting since before the 2016 campaign. Political scientists have found that over the last decade or so, support for feminism, from both men and women, has been increasingly correlated with support for Democrats. The battle over Judge Kavanaugh is perhaps our starkest reflection of that new political reality. Let’s think through these new dynamics with a little thought experiment: • A prominent Democratic woman becomes the front-runner for the nomination in 2020. How do her male rivals attack her? How do they convince female voters that they’re a better face for the party? • This same woman wins the nomination. She’s up against President Trump. How does that contest become anything but a circus? • A woman comes forward with a highly credible accusation of sexual abuse against a top political leader. It’s true. Who has the credibility to litigate that, politically? And can you convince Republicans? • A woman comes forward with a highly credible accusation of sexual abuse. It’s not true. Who has the credibility to litigate that? And can you convince Democrats? In a twist that will surprise no one, both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton addressed the confirmation battle in public appearances today, just an hour or so apart. (Yes, we’re all caught in an episode of Black Mirror where we can never, ever escape the 2016 election. Just accept it. It’s easier that way.) When asked by reporters if he had a message for men, Mr. Trump said: “It’s a very scary time for young men in America, when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of. This is a very, very — this is a very difficult time. What’s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice.” It’s an argument — articulated loudly during last week’s hearing by Senator Lindsey Graham — that has been gaining traction in the Republican Party since Mr. Trump’s win. We know from polling that a higher percentage of Trump backers believe white men face discrimination. Mrs. Clinton had a different take, one that reflects the thinking of many in her party. “I think what is happening is that on many many fronts, women, young women and girls, are saying, ‘You have to hear our stories, too. We have the right to be heard,’” she said, speaking at an event hosted by The Atlantic magazine. “I don’t see it so much as some kind of conflict, as finally righting the balance.” Many women found something deeply recognizable in Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony. They are sharing their own experiences of sexual assault — and becoming more radical in how they’re doing so, as seen the video of the confrontation with Senator Jeff Flake last week. Judge Kavanaguh’s approval ratings are sinking — a decline attributable to independent women. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. is investigating, trying to figure out what actually happened on that summer night so many decades ago. It’s hard to imagine a conclusive ending. The reality is that both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey could be telling their truths. Maybe one is misremembering what happened. Maybe one is lying. It almost doesn’t matter. The universality of their interaction — both for men and women — has tapped into something that’s not likely to be resolved with a Senate vote. ____________________ We published a really great guide to the midterms today, called “Everything You Need to Know for the Midterm Elections.” But we still had questions! So we reached out to political reporter Matt Flegenheimer, who wrote the report, for more. We talked on Slack, which is the way a lot of conversations tend to happen at The New York Times. Lisa [12:13 PM] Hey! So we loved your election guide today. Helpful! But for real, what are the questions people ask you about the midterms? It can’t be where to vote... Matt [12:15 PM] Only occasionally! But my knowledge is limited to northwest D.C., if that. I mean, everyone wants to know who’s going to win, right? And they want certainty, which is pretty dicey. For all the talk lamenting “horse race” coverage of politics, the question I get most often, by far, is... who’s going to win the race? Lisa [12:17 PM] What do you tell them? I totally dodge that one. Always. After the 2016 situation, I’m SO out of the prediction business... Matt [12:20 PM] Dodging is key. Don’t you wind up feeling like a politician sometimes? “Well, there are very compelling arguments on both sides...” I guess I try to walk people through the factors that would suggest a good year for Dems (serious intensity, an aggressive House map) and others that could boost Republicans (the strong economy, a favorable Senate map). This rarely satisfies anyone. Lisa [12:24 PM] I am unsatisfied! The other big one I get is Will Trump Be Impeached? Typically asked with a lot of emotion/yelling. My take on that is that if Democrats win the House, the chances go up. But not much. It still seems like such a long shot, given that 2/3 of the Senate would have to vote for it. Matt [12:26 PM] Totally. And some left-leaning readers seem to have VERY high expectations for this (and the special counsel investigation) that don’t necessarily match up with the likeliest scenario. This vision of Robert Mueller dragging Trump from the Oval in handcuffs while delivering an Aaron Sorkin monologue seems... unlikely. Lisa [12:30 PM] I wonder if Robert Mueller is that poetic? I feel like we only ever see him walking down hallways with a very purposeful gait. Anyhow, give us one more question you get and we’ll call it an afternoon. Matt [12:31 PM] There is poetry in meaningful walking. The specific race that everyone asks about is Texas — partly because I’ve covered it — but that’s one that really seems to have broken through well beyond the state itself. “Can Beto really win?” “Is Cruz actually sweating this?” Yes! And yes! And that should not be confused with a prediction that it’ll actually happen. #anotherdodge Lisa [12:34 PM] Thanks, Fleg. That was fun. Let’s do it again sometime? Maybe before Nov. 6? Matt [12:35 PM] For sure. Or we do it Nov. 7 and pretend we nailed every prediction. Lisa [12:36 PM] Win!

2018,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer: With Health Care, the Personal Becomes Political","Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] The story of her mother’s death was never easy for Elissa Slotkin to tell. Ms. Slotkin and her brother had pushed their mother into reinstating her health insurance, which she had dropped after losing her job. But she let the new policy lapse, opting to pay another bill before her $1,000-per-month premium. A few weeks later, she walked into an emergency room and learned she had stage-four ovarian cancer. The same month she received her terminal diagnosis, she had to consider filing for bankruptcy. Nearly a decade later, Ms. Slotkin watched her congressman, Mike Bishop, a Republican, smiling and standing alongside the president at an event to celebrate the House passing its version of a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “Something in me just broke,” she said. Ms. Slotkin decided to challenge Mr. Bishop for his seat in Michigan’s Eighth District. And she knew she wanted her mother’s story to be part of her campaign. What she didn’t expect was just how many people would be eager to hear it. The story has became a central theme of her campaign — she even released an ad featuring her sick mother delivering a speech at her wedding. “It was difficult at the beginning to talk about it, and then it really became this important opening for people to tell me about their lives,” she said. “When I tell the story of my mom, that is the story that the majority of people really connect to.” Stories like Ms. Slotkin’s abound among Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. In New Jersey, Andy Kim talks about a prenatal health scare that affected his younger son. In Illinois, Betsy Dirksen Londrigan describes how her son almost died of a septic infection at age nine. In Illinois, Lauren Underwood shares how her own heart condition, SVT, makes her someone with a pre-existing condition. And in Arkansas, Clarke Tucker shares his 2017 diagnosis of bladder cancer. “I share our story because the only thing that makes our story unique is that it’s ours,” said Ms. Dirksen Londrigan. “It just cuts across any line because it’s just such a personal human connection that is made.” After years as a drag on Democratic candidates, health care has transformed into a powerful — and personal — weapon for the party. In polls, Democratic voters list health care as the most important issue in the midterm elections. Strategists are listening: Of all the political ads aired by Democrats in House and Senate races last month, the highest percentage focused on health care, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. Part of the issue’s power comes from the fact that the health care law remains under threat, even after Republicans failed to repeal it in the Senate last year. A pending lawsuit brought by 20 Republican-led states, and backed by the Trump administration, could allow insurance companies to stop covering people with pre-existing medical conditions. Three-quarters of voters say it is “very important” to them that the health care law protect people with pre-existing conditions. Those kinds of numbers have left Republicans in competitive races trying to square their nearly decade of opposition to the law with voters’ support for one of its most popular elements. To do so, they’re stealing a play from their Democratic opponents. In February, the Missouri attorney general Josh Hawley joined the Republican lawsuit to overturn the health care law. Seven months later, as a candidate for Senate, he released an ad proclaiming his support for covering pre-existing conditions. His reason: the affliction of his young son, who was diagnosed with a rare chronic disease. “A pre-existing condition, we know what that’s like,” he said. In California, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, who voted to repeal the law, released an ad detailing his daughter’s diagnosis of childhood leukemia. “It was devastating to my family, but we got through it and today she’s doing great,” Mr. Rohrabacher says. “That’s why I am taking on both parties and fighting for those with pre-existing conditions.” Last Sunday, Mr. Bishop, Ms. Slotkin’s opponent, brought up his own health care story during a televised debate, in an effort to defend his vote on the health care repeal. “My wife has a pre-existing condition,” he said. “It is first and foremost on my mind.” ____________________ Yes, we saw Kanye West in the Oval Office. It was crazy. That’s all we have on that one. But the Trump family made news in a few other ways today that we thought were worth mentioning: • This morning, President Trump called into “Fox and Friends” and spent 47 minutes weighing in on seemingly every issue of the day, from Hurricane Michael (a “speedster”) to the midterms (“there are Senate races that we weren’t even going to contest that we’re leading in”) to that anonymous Op-Ed (“there is a very good chance that that was written by The Times … because The Times is totally corrupt”). • Melania Trump, who as first lady has led an anti-bullying initiative, told ABC News, “I could say I’m the most bullied person on the world.” When pressed by the reporter, she stood by her claim. “One of them,” she said, “if you really see what people saying about me.” [Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every evening.] ____________________ This won’t come as a big shock, but our colleagues in the Opinion section are always arguing. They fashion arguments for a living, after all — with politicians, with experts and with each other. It’s this last bit that is of interest this week, because today marks the debut of their new podcast, The Argument. I’ll let the editors over there describe it: The basic idea behind the podcast is that most Americans don’t want to live in a political bubble and would like to hear from people who disagree with them. This may seem like wishful thinking right now, but we’re going to give it a try anyway. In the first episode, three op-ed columnists with wildly divergent views — Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt — take on the question of the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, as well as the political consequences of Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation and the #MeToo movement generally. Also, Ross Douthat sings a bit of “A Star Is Born.” Let’s just say you have to listen to it to understand how it happened. The aftermath of Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation dominated our coverage this week, but there was lots of other good stuff to read. Before we leave the court, do check out Linda Greenhouse’s piece on the lessons Justice Kavanaugh should learn from the career of Justice Hugo Black, who ended life as an exemplary civil libertarian but began it as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. And the midterms featured in several sharp arguments — about the size and scope of the Trump coalition in the Midwest, and how much economic anxiety matters to his supporters. But even the most politically minded editors in Opinion get tired of seeing the word “midterms.” With Hurricane Michael still trashing the south, we have been worrying a lot about climate change, which you can read about in this fascinating graphics-and-data-driven story on heat and humidity. We have also been thinking about the ongoing fight over a suit concerning affirmative action at Harvard (the trial begins Monday), which was brilliantly dissected today by Elise Boddie. And finally, in the did-I-just-read-that-in-The-New-York-Times department, Neil Pollack shared the heartbreaking story of his attempt to stop living his life in a marijuana fog. Listen to the new podcast, The Argument, here. _____________________ A new story in The Times Magazine dives into Democratic efforts, or the lack thereof, to connect with veterans. We wanted to know more, so we asked Lauren Katzenberg, the editor of the magazine’s At War channel, to tell us about the story. Democrats have a rare opportunity to gain a foothold against the Republican Party in the coming midterms. If they come up short, it may be in part because of a failure to pursue a key group of voters: military veterans. Here are three takeaways from our reporting: 1. Veterans make up 13 percent of the voting population. They also enjoy high voter turnout (in 2016, veterans voted at a rate 6 percent higher than nonveterans) and are especially concentrated in some decisive swing states. 2. Democrats seem more focused on running veterans as candidates. They tried that approach in the 2006 midterms, when they ran dozens of veterans as candidates under the banner of the “Fighting Dems,” but only six of them won their elections. 3. Republicans, meanwhile, are approaching the midterms with a seasoned ground game to mobilize veteran voters. Republican staff members have built a permanent presence in veteran communities across the country. The conservative group Concerned Veterans for America, for example, has 12,000 active volunteers and a potent operation at work in 13 key states.

Here’s how disinformation is spreading ahead of the midterms. • Hurricane Michael pummeled the Florida Panhandle with winds of up to 155 m.p.h.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: ‘A Revitalization of Democracy’,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation was a huge victory for Republicans — the culmination of decades of activism and advocacy for a conservative court. I was curious how the other side was feeling. To get a sense, I traveled to the Detroit suburbs and sat down with Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic candidate for governor in Michigan, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. We talked about Justice Kavanaugh, the midterms and why they believe American women “are on fire.” Here’s an abridged version of our conversation. LISA: A lot of Democratic women felt Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation was a sign that the Senate didn’t believe Christine Blasey Ford and took that very personally. Was that the case for both of you? GILLIBRAND: I bet if you polled America she was believed, but the really sad fact is she was believed and it doesn’t matter. So I’m looking at my colleagues and saying, you did believe her and you don’t care. Because that’s the real indictment of the Republican Party — they may well have believed her and they didn’t care. WHITMER: I’m a sexual assault survivor and I’ve talked about it publicly, and you know, to watch that play out, for every survivor, it’s not a moment in your life, as Dr. Ford so eloquently explained. It’s something that’s a scar you carry for the rest of your life. And so every time you see this play out, so many women across our country are reliving their experience. GILLIBRAND: The sad part about the last week was it was all about what does power look like. Who has it and who doesn’t. And it was really clear that Mitch McConnell had all the power, and he was able to set the rules, and set rules that weren’t fair. McConnell called the opposition to Justice Kavanaugh a “great political gift” for Republicans. GILLIBRAND: Oh, I disagree. I believe that women in America are on fire, and they are so motivated and so inspired to make sure their voices are heard. You’re seeing a transformation in the electorate about who’s turning out to vote, who’s mobilizing, who’s showing up at rallies and showing up at town halls. The energy that’s in the grass roots is real. It’s profound, it’s palpable. WHITMER: I really believe this is a movement. I was a little concerned that maybe the intensity of the reaction would wave over time. I’ve not seen that for a second, and I’m in the state that put Trump in the White House. It’s growing. Senator Susan Collins might disagree. She said on Sunday that she doesn’t believe that now Justice Kavanaugh assaulted Dr. Ford. What’s your reaction? GILLIBRAND: You know, in the same way Senator Collins voted yes, Senator Murkowski voted no. So to see that split, even within the Republican Party among two moderate women, I think that was an affirmation of the basic premise of our conversation — that women feel these moments very differently, and they’re looking for different solutions. But this is something that all 100 senators should be asked, to vote against Judge Kavanaugh, and it shouldn’t have been left to the women’s shoulders. It should never have been only the women who could possibly be the paradigms of goodness and grace and beacons of hope and life. I want to ask you both about the atmosphere around the vote. The president said Democrats were “an angry mob.” Could Democrats face a backlash for how they handled the nomination? GILLIBRAND: I’m not concerned that there will be a backlash, because what I’ve seen so far is just regular people standing up and demanding their voice be heard. I think it makes some people uncomfortable, but people are so angry and frustrated and concerned that they’re willing to protest. WHITMER: People who are trying to hold onto their status in the upper echelons of decision-making in the country, they’re vilifying anyone who doesn’t see the world the same way, whether it’s Serena on the tennis court or the woman who’s outside locking arms with her fellow protesters. I think they’re missing the point of what’s happening in this country right now. Has either of you ever been accosted at a restaurant or an airport? GILLIBRAND: Oh, all the time. I think talking to the people who are angry is important. I do it every time. Because if you’re in public service, you serve everyone. But I do think the turmoil is necessary. And so it’s almost been a revitalization of democracy in a way that’s so powerful and so profound. What’s the message the Democratic Party should be taking from the fight over Justice Kavanaugh? GILLIBRAND: Women feel so devalued, so minimized, so dismissed. So I think that, to me, the message is, if you’re not listening to what’s going on in these women’s lives then you don’t care about them, and you don’t value them, and you will not be the standard-bearer for our party. WHITMER: 2018 will show how the Democratic Party is growing and changing. If Stacey Abrams is governor in Georgia and I’m governor in Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham is governor in New Mexico—— GILLIBRAND: That’s different. That’s better. That’s going to show the power. WHITMER: Those are three executives. A Latino woman and an African-American woman and me. GILLIBRAND: A nice white woman here. WHITMER: These executive races are going to change the dynamic of the Democratic Party. GILLIBRAND: Women don’t get elected to governor, traditionally. So they’re going to show that not only do we run, but we get elected. There’s still massive institutional bias in all institutions against women and against diversity. That’s just a fact. The current political power structure is biased toward the traditional model of male leadership. I think that power infrastructure is somewhat uncomfortable with the shift that’s happening right below their feet. I see it in all industries, and I think the Democratic Party is not immune. And so our job is to just keep elevating the voices of our constituents and making sure that they are heard, and making sure that these women candidates are given every opportunity to set their agendas. ____________________ By some accounts, the most interesting race this November is over a Senate seat in Texas. Manny Fernandez, who covers Texas for The Times, sent us this dispatch from Houston: The tightest race in Texas is giving new meaning to identity politics. Senator Ted Cruz is locked in a fierce bid for re-election against his Democratic rival, Representative Beto O’Rourke. But it’s not quite Ted versus Beto. Technically, it’s Rafael versus Robert. People’s first names are rarely a thing in politics. This race is the exception. The incumbent, Rafael Edward Cruz, a Cuban-American who appeals to white conservatives, disliked the ring of Rafael and Rafaelito as a teenager and took on the less Hispanic-sounding Ted, a nickname of Edward. The challenger, Robert Francis O’Rourke, an Irish-American who appeals to white liberals, embraced the more Hispanic-sounding Beto, a Spanish nickname of Roberto, as a boy in El Paso. That red sign reading “Beto’s” off Interstate 20 in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie? It’s not his new campaign office. It’s a popular Mexican restaurant. The shorthand for the race has become Beto versus Cruz. But who uses which name, and how, when talking about the two candidates says a lot about which way they lean. Some of Mr. O’Rourke’s Republican critics deny him any nod to Latino culture and refer to him as Robert Francis O’Rourke. Some of Mr. Cruz’s Democratic critics deny him any move away from Latino culture and refer to him as Rafael Cruz. The situation could have been far different for the headline writers of America. As Mr. Cruz described his boyhood nicknames in “A Time for Truth,” his 2015 biography: “Until I was thirteen, I was ‘Felito Cruz.’ The problem with that name was that it seemed to rhyme with every major corn chip on the market.” That’s right: It could have been Beto versus Felito. [Read Manny’s story on the first debate between Mr. Cruz and Mr. O’Rourke.] ____________________ Where do voters stand right now on “the tightest race in Texas”? We’re trying to find out. The Times’s Live Polls project is calling voters across the state tonight, and you can follow along here. What should you look out for? • Will Mr. Cruz retain his modest edge? In poll after poll, Mr. Cruz’s lead has hovered in the single digits, occasionally drawing even with Mr. O’Rourke. Will that trend hold? • How are NFL protests seen in football country? We’re asking people two questions about NFL protests — whether they support players kneeling, and whether they support their right to kneel. It will be interesting to see how a state that loves football, and that has longstanding support for personal freedoms, responds. • See all those white dots? The Live Polls project documents every call, showing just how hard pollsters have to work to reach voters. (In our polling of Texas’ 31st District, for instance, we made 32,002 calls. Only 490 people spoke to us.) It helps explain why polls are better predictors of moods and trends than of winners and losers. Watch the live results come in here. The polling will continue for the next few days. ____________________ • After years of avoiding politics, Taylor Swift has made her first endorsements. The candidates?

2018,"On Wall Street, the Bond Market Sets the Tone","The rise in yields is a double-edged sword. It reflects optimism about the economy, but also gives traders reasons to worry. The bond market dominated the conversation on Wall Street this week as yields on benchmark Treasury bonds, which help determine interest rates for borrowers ranging from first-time home buyers to international corporations, steadily rose to seven-year highs. The increase is something of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, a rise in yields reflects the strength of the economy. At the end of Friday, after a report showed unemployment is at its lowest since 1969, the yield on the 10-year note — or what the United States government will pay to borrow money for a decade — was 3.23 percent. It hadn’t been that high since May 2011. But as rates rise, borrowing will also become more expensive for consumers and companies, potentially slowing growth. Higher rates also change the balance of risk and reward for investors in other markets. Reflecting this, stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ending the week down more than 1 percent. The idea that growth will push interest rates higher, only for higher rates to slow things down again, reflects the cyclical nature of the economy. Right now, rates are somewhere in between — not high enough to hurt growth, but rising and making some investors wary as they do. Here’s what to make of it all. The economy Government bonds are known as safe haven investments. People buy them, instead of riskier investments like stocks, corporate debt and commodities, because they’re worried about something: the economy, war, politics, you name it. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices, so yields fall during such rough patches. Since the financial crisis hit a decade ago, yields have been pretty low. The yield on the 10-year note has spent much of the past decade below 3 percent. (The low point was under 1.4 percent in July 2016.) Those yields prevailed even as the American economy recovered. That’s partly because the Federal Reserve took extraordinary steps to try to nurse the economy back to health. But it also reflected lingering doubts among investors about the expansion. Even recently, plenty of investors have doubted whether the economy could grow as a trade war erupted. But grow it has, with gross domestic product expanding at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter, and even some glass-half-empty types are becoming convinced that a recession isn’t in the cards any time soon. So yields are rising. “Big picture, the economy is very strong,” said Tim High, an interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. “The employment market remains very strong.” In fact, the worry has now switched to whether that growth will start to run too hot, leading to faster inflation and pushing the Fed to raise interest rates faster than it would like. For now, High said, that isn’t something to worry about — which means investors should be spared any nasty economic surprises. The Future In the United States, we rely on a lot of debt to fuel the economy. And when the cost of that debt rises, it can drag on growth. We’re about to find out how heavy that weight will be. As we’ve said, for much of the last decade, long-term interest rates — which are essentially set by the Treasury market — have been quite low. Now rising rates are pulling other key borrowing costs higher. Rates on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are above 4.7 percent, the highest level since 2011. Likewise, interest rates on 48-month new car loans have risen to more than 5 percent. They hadn’t been that high since 2012, according to the most recent data from the Fed. Traditionally, cars and houses play a big role in the consumption-driven American economy. And if there’s a weak spot in the otherwise strong economy, it could be in these interest-sensitive sectors. Sales of existing homes have slipped in recent months. They were flat in August, and are down 1.5 percent from the previous year. Automakers have reported steep declines in sales in September. Part of that decline reflected hurricanes that caused flooding in the Carolinas. But higher interest rates and rising car prices are also pushing some buyers toward the used car market. The Stock Market We often talk about financial markets — stocks, corporate debt, government bonds, commodities — as if they existed in complete isolation from one another. They don’t. Changes in one can often have large effects on another. If oil prices fall, for example, that’s obviously going to pinch the earnings of the companies that pump oil and refine gasoline. That will affect the stock prices of those companies, and the stock market as a whole. Likewise, higher yields on government bonds can have a subtle, but important, impact on the stock market. As rates move higher, they can persuade more and more people who’ve ridden the nearly decade-long bull market in stocks to take some of their winnings off the table and sock them away in government bonds. Eventually, that could start to take the wind out of the stock market’s sails.",The New York Times
2018,"On a Family Road Trip Through Germany: Fairy Tales, Castles and Cuckoo Clocks","Years after a magical solo trip through the Black Forest and beyond, the writer returns with her family. Would the magic hold up with three medium-size children? In Bavaria, Neuschwanstein Castle, the inspiration for Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle, is an obligatory stop on a trip through fairy tale Germany.CreditCreditAndreas Meichsner for The New York Times Certain trips acquire an almost mythical quality over time: You leave home at the right moment and return just as it passes. You have friends to visit along your route, and all of them are delighted to put you up. You rent the right car, pack the right books, eat remarkably well and make your own discoveries, all roughly within your budget. Glowing memories ensue. For me, it was southern Germany, circa 2003, and it was a solo vacation: route devised according to my whims alone; tiny car stocked with audiobooks entirely of my choosing; and a freelance assignment to help finance the thing. I flew into Frankfurt where I visited college friends, and continued to Heidelberg. Then it was all work in Baden-Baden, where I had been asked to compare the town’s famed Old World spa treatments with the latest high-tech spas in New York for a women’s magazine (a hardship assignment, to be sure). For nearly three weeks, I meandered through the Black Forest, across the Alpenstrasse where small woodland creatures seemed to frolic beside me Snow White-style, in the early October frost, into Munich and then up north through a landscape speckled with Germany’s famed castles and medieval cities (known as the Romantic Road) back to Frankfurt. There was only one thing missing: children. The toyshops of Heidelberg, their wares clearly cobbled together by wood sprites with tiny hammers, begged for a child’s awed gasps. The Black Forest with its wooded peaks, signature cake and half-timbered houses wasn’t quite Grimm enough without them. Cuckoo clocks are not for grown-ups. The Deutsches Museum in Munich needed kids running around its trains; the night watchman’s tour of the walled city of Rothenburg was intended to spook. These things were best appreciated by a family, and I didn’t have one. Fifteen years later, I do, and the plan was to replicate, as closely as possible, my original itinerary together, a family of five. Would the magic hold up and perhaps acquire extra fairy dust in the company of three medium-size children? Was the timing right, or were we too late? Now 9, 11 and 13, my children had graduated from wooden playthings, and left behind earlier days of reading Grimm, watching the Disney versions on repeat and memorizing the lyrics from “Into the Woods.” They’d moved on to Greek myths and J.R.R. Tolkien, Dungeons & Dragons and dystopian fiction. Though the source material was clearly the same. Traveling with one or two kids is relatively straightforward: You can rent pretty much any size car. You can squeeze into a single room. Not so when you’ve overdone it with three or more. Everything is more complicated at hotels, especially with three children who are at an age when asking any of them to share a bed is like putting two cats in a bag. Verboten. Unless your children have the magical combination of age, gender and disposition to sleep peacefully in the same bed (hats off), you need a room with four beds, or better yet, a room with one bed and another with three. [What should you read on a fairy tale vacation? We’ve got suggestions, for both classics and new takes.] You also need a minivan. Not a stylish European minivan that could pass for a car if you squint. No, you need a big, dumb American version — and do not confuse that with an S.U.V., which has neither the legroom for five nor the trunk capacity for five suitcases. Car rental companies do not generally get into these subtleties, which is why we found ourselves staggering with jet lag at the Frankfurt airport, filling out forms to upgrade to a decent-size minivan, one that might even fit all our suitcases if we abandoned the concept of rearview vision. We were tired. We were hungry. We set off to Heidelberg on a series of German autobahns, squeezed into what felt like a Beetle. 50 miles Germany Frankfurt Rhine Main Nuremburg Heidelberg Rothenburg ob der Tauber Baden- Württemberg Baden-Baden France Stuttgart Bavaria Gutach Rust Neckar R. Munich Triberg black forest Mittenwald Lake Constance Switzerland Austria By The New York Times With one more challenge — or, as a fairy tale would have it, an obstacle: One of those three children is vegan and we were in southern Germany where vegetarianism is only lightly tolerated, and vegan (we tried out various pronunciations on our waiters) is understood mostly as an insult in the land of bratwurst and schnitzel. Menus had to be scrutinized, allergen lists examined. Waiters, stumped, retreated into kitchens to consult with chefs. At one Swabian restaurant, the waiter apologetically retrieved a bowl of noodles made with eggs. At another, when we asked if we could just please get a veggie plate, the owner threw up his hands. “Vegetables?” he huffed, motioning us out. “This is a traditional Bavarian restaurant; we don’t have vegetables!” Driving was less challenging, despite kids prone to backseat nausea. We kept our rides under two hours. Remaining within two regions, Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, we traveled from Heidelberg to Baden-Baden, through the Black Forest, down to the Bodensee and into Bavaria, upward to Munich and northward on the Romantic Road back to Frankfurt. Our hotels began in jetlag-friendly luxury, before downshifting to more modest, but still spacious, lodgings and a three-day Airbnb in Munich, with a strategic happy ending at a castle stay outside Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Once in Heidelberg, we settled into the sumptuous Die Hirschgasse hotel, just across the Neckar River from the city’s Fodor’s-friendly Altstadt (Old Town). It was Sunday, when — in southern Germany at least — most stores are closed. We made our way down the main commercial stretch, infusing ourselves with gelato and gummy candy at regular intervals while dodging a swarm of bees that had apocalyptically descended on the town (fairy tale reference point: “The Queen Bee,” Brothers Grimm, Tale 62). We then set out for the local postcard attraction, the ruins of Schloss Heidelberg, best reached by a funicular tram (sit at the front of the head car on the way down for that vertiginous plunge kids can’t seem to get enough of). The castle is defunct; its trimmings and furniture, long gone. In many places, the stone-bare walls are barely standing. But a few key historical items remained in the interior. Our family favorite was the “Big Barrel,” which we imagined inebriating many a medieval castle dweller in its day, discovered Goldilocks-fashion only after following signs that led first to a deceptively large “small” barrel, then to a medium one (immense). It was hard not to imagine a giant of yore guzzling draft from its commodious spout. The city’s most moving site betrayed a more recent devastation, one we came upon accidentally. Synagogue Square, a stark, near-empty anomaly in the crowded old city, marks the site of Heidelberg’s former Jewish house of worship, which was burned down by Nazi storm troopers in 1938. Its shattered congregants were forced afterward to pay for the building’s demolition. Today, carefully placed white marble squares represent the former pews and the 12 tribes of Israel. In Baden-Baden, you take to the baths to relieve your pains. For families, that generally means the Caracalla Therme, which, unlike the more ornate Friedrichsbad, does not enforce nudity. My kids were all in. Prepaid entry is timed and I recommend overestimating your allotted stay; otherwise you pay by the minute, and, alas, we paid, in more ways than one. The bathhouse clearly expects theft and it gets it. No sooner had we tossed our rented towels onto a chaise than one was stolen. The cost of suffering a purloined towel and shivering child, according to the immovable staff, was 21 euros (about $24). It was worth it, however, for the thorough soaking, frolic and relaxation of hours spent hopping from one pool to another, water in all its manifestations: bathtub-warm to Jacuzzi-hot to scented steam to icy cold. Steeped in chlorine, we washed off and settled in for a good night’s sleep at the modern fairy-tale themed Hotel Der Kleine Prinz. I had originally envisioned reading Grimm tales to my children at night as we roamed the Black Forest. But if I’d suggested “Hansel and Gretel” at their current ages, they’d have sent me off to Frau Holle to do her worst. Instead, to keep things at least somewhat within the spirit of the traditional German fairy tale, we listened to Edgar Allan Poe audiobook stories in the car. At night, my youngest read a series based on the Norse myths, but set in the Black Hills of South Dakota. My middle child picked up his first Stephen King and my eldest blitzed her way through an endless series of post-apocalyptic doom. I read a Jo Nesbo thriller to keep up the spirit. Darkness truly descended in Triberg, a touristy slice of the Black Forest set on a hill under Germany’s highest waterfall. Here, I had promised my children a visit to the Cuckoo Clock Museum. I had such fond memories of the place! The museum’s main room was huge, cavernous, sunken, wood-paneled. Inside, Geppetto-style, was clock after chirping clock, each more wondrously intricate than the last. But where was the museum? We visited many kitschy cuckoo clock stores, all apparently called “House of 1,000 Clocks,” and a very modern German Clock Museum, which had one singular and magnificent cuckoo specimen, but was otherwise a standard glass-displayed history of time-telling accompanied by all-German labels. We went to the Black Forest Museum, which had an excellent collection of “orchestriums,” mechanical machines that replicated the sound of a full orchestra. Yet the magical museum of my memory was not to be found. And so we went to the park. Two of them. In recent decades, “barefoot parks,” public spaces specifically groomed to accommodate earthy types without their Birkenstocks, have sprung up around Europe, mostly in Germany and Austria. For a small fee, visitors are provided lockers for their shoes, before setting off on a path designed to heighten one’s attention to the senses, from the painful spike of walking across wood chips or on gravel, to the squishiness of traipsing through mud puddles. Along the way, visitors are encouraged to touch, smell and explore the outdoors and meditate in the shade. Our chosen destination, The Park of the Senses, outside the small town of Gutach, felt like a tonic after the touristic onslaught of cuckoo chimes. We headed into the woods. On the far side of one especially sunny stretch was a dark, enclosed chamber; we plunged in through heavy flaps where we made our way along an uneven footpath through twisty corridors. Reaching for a child’s shoulder, I fumbled my hand into an unidentified body part of a fellow parkgoer, who let out a Teutonic yelp of disbelief. Our second park was more conventional. Visiting an amusement park, with the exception of Copenhagen’s historic Tivoli, has never been on the top of my European to-do list. But how could I deprive my offspring of Europa Park, billed as Europe’s second largest (after a certain American import in Paris) and conveniently situated on the edge of the Black Forest in the French-German border town of Rust? Europa Park is like Disneyland stripped of its commercial veneer. Organized nominally by European country, food and rides reflect each geographic region. Germany naturally covers the most territory and a lovely section is dedicated to Grimm’s Enchanted Forest, where the tales are fairly represented without cuddly bunnies to offset the fright. Rather than dumping ridegoers into a character-ridden emporium after each 45-second ride, the park relegates stores largely to the background. Not once did I hear, “Can we get?” or “I want that!” The food was varied and halfway decent, but once my kids discovered the Food Loop, where patrons order by touch-screen and meals are delivered to your table via a massive marble mazelike contraption, further culinary exploration was put to a halt. There was already a lot to digest. The scares here were decidedly more bloodcurdling than their Disneyfied renditions. The Silver Star, which featured some kind of turbo engine built by Mercedes, whisked my intrepid 11-year-old to heights and at speeds I chose not to witness up close. Similarly, the Blue Fire Megacoaster (“powered by Gazprom”) made Space Mountain look like Alice’s Spinning Teacups. And all of us were impressed with the virtual-reality enhanced rides, in which you chose from a set of backdrops from a headset before boarding an old-fashioned roller coaster, imagining yourself instead recklessly sledding with a couple of German schoolmates and their dog down a treacherous mountain slope. It was hard not to shriek. We explored a more reality-based alpine landscape during our drive from Lake Constance to Bavaria, where the road dipped back and forth into Switzerland and then Austria before we made the obligatory stop at Schloss Neuschwanstein, Walt Disney’s inspiration for the Sleeping Beauty castle. A subtler fairy tale setting was found in the small town of Mittenwald, Germany’s center for violin-making, with its impeccably preserved pedestrian old town, canals flowing along the cobblestone streets. The exterior walls of its whitewashed buildings are painted Bavarian-style with biblical scenes and imagery depicting the varying trades of the shopkeepers and restaurateurs within. My two cello-playing sons were entranced by visits to the studios of the celebrated luthiers, Anton Maller, who allowed my trembling older son to play a $10,000 cello, and Anton Sprenger, who gave us an impromptu concert on his own violin. (A photo on the wall showed him in the company of Angela Merkel and a grinning Barack Obama. We were likewise dazzled.) Then we entered into a story ourselves. Reunited with one of our former German au pairs in Munich, we bounded from museum to palace to platz to shopping arcade throughout the city until, near exhaustion, we happened on a temporary exhibition, “Thrill of Deception,” at the Kunsthalle. Inside, a series of rooms showcased the arts of optical illusion, trompe d’oeil and visual trickery from the ancient world to today. Near the end, like a hidden treasure, we discovered Laurie Anderson and Hsin-Chien Huang’s 2017 virtual reality installation, “Chalkroom.” (The exhibit is open through January 2019 and also viewable at MASS MoCA through 2019) The viewer, or more accurately, the participant, enters a dark room whose walls are covered with words scrawled in chalk. Wearing a virtual reality headset with attached remote controls, you’re offered various options (Ms. Anderson’s gravelly voice guides you) for exploring the virtual landscape. You can fly, for example, through swirling words or plunge yourself headlong into the text. Phrases rush by, occasionally forming sentences. You are fully immersed in — and only occasionally in control of — the narrative. It’s a very contemporary form of storytelling, a technologically enhanced one, a kind of modern magic, a voyage of discovery where you are at once storyteller and reader. We emerged, all of us, flushed with enchantment.",The New York Times
2018,"On a Tiny Finnish Island, a Helipad, 9 Piers — and the Russian Military?","SAKKILUOTO, Finland — Retired to a tiny island in an archipelago between Finland and Sweden, Leo Gastgivar awoke early one morning to visit the outhouse in his bathrobe, only to notice two black speedboats packed with Finnish commandos in camouflage fatigues waiting in the bay near his front door. After an exchange of awkward greetings, Mr. Gastgivar went inside, collected a pair of binoculars and watched aghast as the commandos raced off toward the island of his nearest neighbor, a mysterious Russian businessman he had never met or even seen. “I thought: ‘Wow! That is certainly unusual,’” Mr. Gastgivar recalled of the encounter. “Nobody ever visits that place.” The island, Sakkiluoto, belongs to Pavel Melnikov, a 54-year-old Russian from St. Petersburg, who has dotted the property with security cameras, motion detectors and no-trespassing signs emblazoned with the picture of a fearsome-looking guard in a black balaclava. The island also has nine piers, a helipad, a swimming pool draped in camouflage netting and enough housing — all of it equipped with satellite dishes — to accommodate a small army. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.] The whole thing is so strange that the Sept. 22 raid, one of 17 in the same area on the same day, has stirred fevered speculation in Finland that the island’s real owner could be the Russian military. Finnish officials have attributed the raid to a crackdown on money laundering and cheating on tax and pension payments. But few are convinced. More than 400 Finnish police officers and military personnel swooped down on Sakkiluoto and 16 other properties in western Finland linked to Russia. Helicopters and a surveillance plane provided support. The air space over the region was closed to all craft not involved in the security operation. When Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia visited Helsinki, Finland’s capital, a few days after the raid, he scoffed when asked at a news conference if Russia had been preparing landing zones for military helicopters on Finnish islands. “I don’t know in whose sick mind such a thought could be formulated,” Mr. Medvedev said. “Such thinking is paranoid.” Yet the problem for Russia, and now also for Finland, is credibility. Moscow has denied so many strange and sinister things that have turned out to be true — or at least far more plausible than the Kremlin’s often-risible counter stories — that even the most seemingly far-fetched speculation about Russian mischief tends to acquire traction. One former member of the Finnish Parliament, who once served as a border guard officer, has claimed without evidence that Russia had plans to build docks to service its submarines. One theory popular on social media is that the raided islands — which lie near Finnish military installations and important Baltic Sea shipping lanes — were part of an undercover operation by Russia’s military intelligence service, the G.U., formerly known as the G.R.U. Mr. Gastgivar, for one, has long thought something curious was going on at his Russian neighbor’s island. “I’ve been thinking for many years that they are doing something military over there,” he said. “Building, building, building, but nobody knows what for.” Finland’s intelligence service, according to recent reports in the Finnish news media, has long warned that property purchased in Finland by Russian nationals could be used for military purposes. During a recent visit to the island, not a soul was in sight, only clusters of deserted clapboard villas joined by wooden pathways through the forest of birch and pine that covers the island. Despite the abundant security precautions, no alarms were tripped and nobody rushed out to confront the intruders. Yet the seafront sauna, stacked with fresh towels, looked ready for use, as did the barbecue pits and other amenities on an island that seemed like the luxurious lair of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the fictional villain of James Bond’s creator, Ian Fleming. Finland, anchored firmly in the West but wary of antagonizing Moscow, has a longstanding policy of not raising issues, at least in public, that might create friction with Russia, with which it shares an 830-mile-long border. This approach, however, has come under strain from Russia’s increasing assertiveness. Finland, though not a member of NATO, risked Russian ire this week by sending troops to Norway to join American forces taking part in Trident Juncture, the military alliance’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War in 1991. The September raids coincided with discussions in Parliament of new legislation to strengthen the powers of Finland’s intelligence service. Lawmakers are also considering prohibiting people from outside the European Union from acquiring land in strategic areas. The biggest group of foreign property owners is from Russia, including people close to President Vladimir V. Putin. Two people were taken into custody after the raids — an Estonian of Russian descent and a Russian — and officers seized a stash of cash in multiple currencies, including 3 million euros, or about $3.5 million. Also seized were computer discs and flash drives containing more than 100 terabytes of data — more than 50 times the estimated size of the entire print collection of the Library of Congress. All the targeted properties were linked to Mr. Melnikov, the Russian owner of Sakkiluoto island, and a company he helped set up in 2007 called Airiston Helmi. The company has repeatedly reshuffled its board of directors and ownership over the years, with the identity of its real owners disappearing behind opaque shell companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and other tax havens. It is now headed, at least on paper, by an Italian, who says he took the position as a favor to a businessman he knows from Russia. It is far from clear exactly who Mr. Melnikov is. A man with the same name and birth date appears in Russian corporate and other records as the owner of six companies in Russia, including a well-known manufacturer of plumbing equipment, and as the holder of several patents related to plumbing. That man, now back in Russia at an office in St. Petersburg, declined to comment on what his assistant called “private” matters in Finland. While investing in Finland, Mr. Melnikov operated under several different guises. Annual corporate filings variously identify him as Russian, Latvian and Maltese. Finnish news media outlets report that he also has residency in Hungary and passports from three tiny Caribbean nations that, like Malta, sell citizenship. When Airiston Helmi first registered in Finland in 2007, the company declared itself engaged in “travel and accommodation services as well as real estate holdings and leasing/renting.” It invested millions of euros in buying and developing property on the archipelago between Finland and Sweden but, year after year, reported a loss and had no evident source of revenue. Kaj Karlsson, a Finnish contractor who supervised much of the construction on Sakkiluoto, said he could never work out what Mr. Melnikov was up to, especially after he started building new piers and installed a network of security cameras on an island with no people or crime. “Usually an island has two piers, but how do you explain nine? It makes no sense,” Mr. Karlsson said. Mr. Melnikov, he added, “always made a good impression and seemed legitimate,” but never seemed very interested in getting a return on his investment. “No way is this all about money laundering or tax evasion,” he said. “You don’t put so much effort into a money-laundering case.” Even local officials are skeptical. Patrik Nygren, the mayor of Parainen, the archipelago’s administrative center, said he received no advance notice and was out picking mushrooms with his family when the raids happened. The scale of the operation struck him as strange; Mr. Melnikov sometimes skirted building codes — like when he installed the helipad on Sakkiluoto — but was never threatening, the mayor said. “Personally, I don’t think this operation was just about money laundering. There has to be something else,” he said. Niklas Granholm, deputy director of studies at FOI, the Swedish Defense Research Agency, Division for Defense Analysis, did not rule out that the islands that were raided could have been part of a money-laundering scam. But he added that their helipads, multiple docks, barrackslike structures and location near Finnish military facilities suggested possible preparations for “some kind of hybrid warfare.” Airiston Helmi’s seafront headquarters has a helipad and multiple surveillance cameras like Mr. Melnikov’s island, as well as a decommissioned military landing craft that has been converted into a sauna and three other vessels. Standing guard next to the main entrance of the company’s office is a fashion mannequin dressed in military fatigues with a cracked plastic head. Its basement, according to a recent report in Iltalehti, a Finnish newspaper, contained a communications center with sophisticated equipment far beyond what an ordinary tourism or property company would need. Thomas Willberg, a dairy farmer whose land abuts Airiston Helmi’s headquarters on the mainland, said he was asked several times by the Russian and his associates whether he would be willing to sell his cow patch. He declined. The farmer said he met Mr. Melnikov a few times and did occasional odd jobs for him like clearing snow, but could never figure out why the Russian needed so much security equipment or what kind of business Airiston Helmi was really in. “Finland is maybe sending a signal to our eastern neighbor that it is ready to take action if needed,” Mr. Willberg said. Mr. Karlsson, the former construction supervisor, refused to believe that Mr. Melnikov was setting up hideaways for Russian soldiers, noting that the businessman always insisted on having large glass windows facing the sea — not a good feature to have if bullets are flying. All the same, he conceded that he may have been naïve about Mr. Melnikov’s intentions. “He said he had fallen in love with our archipelago and could feel safe here, unlike at home in Russia. I swallowed that explanation,” Mr. Karlsson said. “Pavel is clearly not what I thought he was,” he said. “I keep asking myself, ‘How could I have been so wrong?’”",The New York Times
2018,On the Ballot This Year: A Lot to Think About,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Happy Halloween! We’re six days away from Election Day, and the Florida ballot might just be the stuff of nightmares. First come the tight races for Senate, House and governor. Then, a slew of local races — everything from Statehouse to school board. And then, finally, comes the parade of ballot measures — 13 in total. Among other issues, Florida voters will decide on whether to permit casinos, ban vaping in indoor workplaces, restore felon voting rights, end a certain kind of betting on greyhound dog racing, increase the judicial retirement age to 75, mandate death benefits for emergency medical workers and increase the amount of home value exempted from property tax. Whew. Floridians are hardly alone. When voters across the country head to the polls, they will be deciding not just on candidates but on a long list of complex policy issues — the majority added to the ballot through efforts by voters and advocacy groups. Over the past two years, there’s been an explosion in the number of citizen-crafted initiatives that end up on the ballot, as voters frustrated with deadlocked government take legislating into their own hands. Some of the measures, like an effort in North Carolina to create a constitutional right to hunt and fish, seem designed by political parties to drive their voters to the polls. Others, like the push to legalize marijuana, are the result of persistent political movements. “The momentum has been building on these issues for a long time,” said Josh Altic, who tracks ballot measures for Ballotpedia, a nonpartisan voter education site. “You see progressive issues in Republican-controlled states, and Republican efforts in places like California opposed to a more liberal, state-controlled legislature.” In total, 69 of the 155 statewide measures on the ballot this year are citizen-initiated, according to Ballotpedia. That’s a slight dip from two years ago, when 71 citizen initiatives were on the ballot. But it’s a significant increase from the past few decades, says Mr. Altic. From 1980 through 2014, an average of 54 citizen initiatives appeared on the ballot. The biggest topic this year is election policy. Twenty measures in 15 states would reshape redistricting, voting requirements, ballot access, campaign finance and ethics. Taxes, marijuana, Medicaid expansion and Marsy’s Law, which expands the rights of crime victims, are also popular proposals. [From our Climate team, here are five ballot measures that could have an impact on climate change.] The campaigns around the initiatives can cost serious cash. A single California proposition that would limit profits for dialysis companies has attracted nearly $110 million in spending. They can also reverberate down the ticket. California Republicans have been fairly blatant in their strategy to use a gas tax repeal measure to drive conservatives to the polls. And in North Carolina, Republicans hope the hunting and fishing mandate, along with a proposal requiring an ID to vote, will juice turnout. Governors and state legislatures are pushing back, using a variety of tactics to overturn, diminish or declare unconstitutional initiatives put on the ballot by the same voters who elected them. This year, 10 citizen-initiated measures were taken off the ballot before November.

(The visuals are really cool, you should check it out.) Here’s some of what we found: • The percentage of candidates who are white men is the lowest it’s been in the last four elections. • More than a quarter of all the candidates running this year are female, including 84 women of color — a 42 percent increase from just two years ago. There are at least 215 candidates of color, and a record 26 openly L.G.B.T. candidates — more than five times the number in 2010. • Among Democratic candidates, white men are actually a minority, making up just 41 percent of candidates for Congress and governor this year. • Three in four Republican candidates are white men. In governor’s races this year, there are no black or Hispanic Republican candidates. • Despite all the diversity, white men will remain a majority. Women and candidates of color will most likely make up close to a third of Congress and governor’s mansions next year, which is about the same as now. Winning all of the races that are considered competitive would increase their share to nearly 40 percent. See the project for yourself: The Faces of Change in the Midterm Elections ____________________ As the election nears, The Times’s live polling project is talking to voters in some of the closest races. Today, Nate Cohn and the Upshot team highlighted a few polls happening right now: Programming note: We’ve made a late switch and plan to poll Steve King’s Iowa district tonight. It’s a conservative district, and had been widely viewed as safe, but we want to see if the latest criticism over his inflammatory remarks is damaging his standing. North Carolina’s Ninth will be a big early test of Republicans’ bend-but-don’t-break path to keeping the House. They can’t afford to lose this district, where Trump approval is holding at +11 and the G.O.P. is +9 on the generic ballot. The Democratic candidate Dan McCready is trailing by one in our latest poll. Of all the races we’ve polled where the Republican is solidly ahead, I feel the Democrats’ best chance at an upset is Washington’s Third District. It’s a combination of the incumbent, Jaime Herrera Beutler, being under 50 percent, and a lot of the undecideds being young, Democrats and Trump disapprovers. There’s a lot of potential there. You can see all our polling here. ____________________ • India has unveiled the world’s tallest statue.

2018,On the Block for a Good Cause,"The sale of artworks from the estate of David and Peggy Rockefeller, which took place at Christie’s New York in May, generated headlines for being the largest single-owner sale in auction history. The $833 million total nearly doubled the haul of the previous record-holder, and individual highlights abounded, including the $85 million price for Claude Monet’s “Nymphéas en Fleur.” But the sale also had another distinction: It was the largest auction ever to benefit charity. All the proceeds went to a slate of diverse nonprofits the Rockefellers supported, including the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, the Museum of Modern Art, Harvard University, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture. Though it was the biggest of the type, the Rockefeller sale is hardly alone in funneling money to good causes via the auction block. “There’s been an acceleration of the trend,” said Marc Porter, chairman of Christie’s Americas. The fall schedule is positively packed with such sales. There are two main types: estates from a single owner, à la Rockefeller, and event sales crafted to benefit a cause. An example of the latter took place last Thursday at Christie’s New York: “Art to Acres,” benefiting the group Global Wildlife Conservation. Twenty works by artists including Rashid Johnson, Anish Kapoor and Ed Ruscha were up for bid, donated by collectors and in some cases by the artists themselves. The sale brought in $1.8 million and even set some artist records, including Mr. Johnson’s “Untitled Escape Collage” (2018), which went for $432,500. Over at Sotheby’s New York, “Creating a Stage: The Collection of Marsha and Robin Williams” will take place on Thursday, with an unspecified portion of the sales going to the Juilliard School, the Wounded Warrior Project, the Challenged Athletes Foundation and the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. Items up for sale include artworks by the likes of Niki de Saint Phalle and Banksy, but also watches and bicycles. The European auction hubs are getting in on the action, too. On Friday and Saturday, Sotheby’s London will host an unusual two-day sale called “The History of Now,” featuring the contemporary collection of David Teiger, a New Jersey arts patron and management consultant who died in 2014. Lots include John Currin’s oil “Minerva” (2000) and Elizabeth Peyton’s painting “Heathrow (Keith), Dec. 1969” (2004). Two of the biggest-ticket items are Peter Doig’s “Buffalo Station I” and “Buffalo Station II,” both from 1997-98 and both estimated to sell for more than $7 million. Sotheby’s is estimating that Mr. Teiger’s collection, including folk art material to be sold in January in New York, is worth more than $100 million, and all the proceeds will go to the arts-focused Teiger Foundation. If the sale meets expectations, the foundation could become one of the biggest of its kind. Later in the month, Sotheby’s Paris and the auction house Pierre Bergé & Associés will offer about 800 lots culled from far-flung homes of the late Mr. Bergé, including in Morocco and Provence. The sale, taking place Oct. 29-31, will partly benefit the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation and the Fondation Jardin Majorelle. (As it happens, the second-biggest single-owner collection ever at auction after the Rockefeller sale was that of Mr. Bergé and his partner in business and life, Yves Saint Laurent, at Christie’s in 2009, which netted $443 million.) For the auction houses, these sales are business: They generally charge buyer’s premiums on each lot, though in some cases discounts or other special deals may be made for charity. But there is a secondary benefit: The venue’s reputation is burnished, since the kind of people who buy and sell art also tend to be philanthropic, or at least to want to associate themselves with such behavior. “It’s good for the house,” said Oliver Barker, chairman of Sotheby’s Europe. “It excites the press and it excites our clients.” Mr. Porter concurred. “There’s a luster for us,” he said. “It increases our presence and depth of communication with other organizations whom we like to consider peers.” Christie’s recently announced that it was partnering with an online charity auction site, Charitybuzz, to help its institutional clients fine-tune their philanthropic auction skill set. From the point of view of the nonprofits, auctions are a preferred method of raising money for a simple reason. “You get people in a room together, and things happen,” said Marie-Claude Bourgie, the vice president of One Drop, which helps promote global access to safe water. The Montreal-based foundation held an auction of about 40 artworks on Sept. 21 at Phillips New York, “Art for One Drop,” a sale specifically crafted to raise money for the nonprofit. The sale raised $8.8 million, a record for the organization, and set five artist records. “Auctions are a great way to raise money,” Ms. Bourgie said. “It creates hype and energy, and people will pay a bit more for a good cause.” Indeed, the organization, created by the Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté, has made auctions something of a specialty, having raised $1.3 million at an auction in March in Las Vegas, though the Phillips sale was the first art-focused iteration. “We’re getting really good at it,” Ms. Bourgie said. “We believe in doing good, and that you can have fun along the way.” She’s not alone. Haley Mellin, an artist and activist who helped set up the “Art to Acres” sale at Christie’s, called it “the first land-conservation auction.” She added that the social nature of in-person bidding provided the secret sauce. “It only takes two people” to bid up a work,” Ms. Mellin said. “The very public marketplace helps us. Auctions are living organisms with a life of their own.” Mr. Barker said one of the milestones of the modern era of such sales was the 2008 (RED) Auction at Sotheby’s New York, which raised $42.6 million for the Global Fund and its work fighting AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. It had the high-profile involvement of Damien Hirst and other boldface names. Mr. Hirst’s sculpture “Where There’s a Will There is a Way” went for $7.15 million. “Damien worked on it and got his artist friends involved,” Mr. Barker said. “Barely anyone who was asked declined.” In May, Sotheby’s sold a group of 42 works within its contemporary art evening sale, with proceeds going to the Studio Museum in Harlem and its David Adjaye-designed building, currently under construction. The artist-donated lots raised $20.2 million, illustrating that they can often include rare and desirable material, Mr. Barker said. In other words, there’s something in it for collectors beyond just doing good. A painting by Mark Bradford, “Speak, Birdman” (2018), brought about $7 million — $5 million more than its estimate. Mr. Bradford represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 2017. “It’s impossible to get a Bradford painting, and it came directly from the studio,” Mr. Barker said. “You couldn’t get a better provenance.” He added that it proved the “virtuous circle” of such events — everybody wins. Although the events may seem glamorous and fun, the sellers who are raising funds have a vested interest in the outcome, and may be biting their nails in the early stages of the bidding. Even Rockefellers worry. Speaking from his house in Maine, David Rockefeller Jr. said that as an executor of his father’s estate, he saw the Christie’s sale as serious business. “Following on his lifetime of pledges to many of these organizations, his executors had the job of making sure he could make good on them,” Mr. Rockefeller said. “There could be a cascade of negative consequences if we didn’t.” Extensive discussions among family members led them to decide that “an auction with as much of a guarantee as possible was the best route to go,” Mr. Rockefeller said. (Auction houses often guarantee a certain amount for a work or an entire sale.) “It was like an insurance policy protecting my father’s pledges,” he added. Timing and luck are a factor. Had the Rockefeller sale happened during the Great Recession, for example, the results could have been drastically lower. “The art market is volatile, and we didn’t know when he was going to die,” Mr. Rockefeller said. “He was very healthy at 95.” (The elder Mr. Rockefeller died in 2017 at 101.) He added that in his mind, the sale was a success in all ways. “It wasn’t only the number,” Mr. Rockefeller said. “It was the style in which it was done. Christie’s presented the works as pieces of how they lived. I can’t think of a route that would have been better.”",The New York Times
2018,"On the Left, Eyeing More Radical Ways to Fight Kavanaugh","WASHINGTON — The bitter partisan fury that engulfed Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation was the fiercest battle in a political war over the judiciary that has been steadily intensifying since the Senate rejected Judge Robert H. Bork in 1987. But an even greater conflagration may be coming. “This confirmation vote will not necessarily be the last word on Brett Kavanaugh serving a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court,” said Brian Fallon, executive director of the liberal group Demand Justice and the top spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Facing a Supreme Court controlled by five solidly conservative justices, liberals have already started to attack the legitimacy of the majority bloc and discussed ways to eventually undo its power without waiting for one of its members to retire or die. Some have gone as far as proposing — if Democrats were to retake control of Congress and the White House in 2020 or after — expanding the number of justices on the court to pack it with liberals or trying to impeach, remove and replace Justice Kavanaugh. Either step would be an extraordinary violation of constitutional and political norms. No justice has been removed through impeachment. And a previous attempt at court packing, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt after a conservative-dominated Supreme Court rejected important parts of his New Deal initiatives during the Great Depression, is broadly seen as having been misguided. Either step would also face steep odds. Some Republicans would have to go along for them to work: a court-expansion bill would need the support of 60 senators to overcome a filibuster, and while a simple majority of the House could vote to impeach, removal would require two-thirds of the Senate. Still, even the political pressure of the threat might make some of the conservative justices more cautious. While Congress rejected Roosevelt’s court-reform bill, the court changed course while lawmakers were considering it and started upholding New Deal laws — a move called “the switch in time that saved nine.” Today, the majority five on the Supreme Court are all movement conservatives — Republican lawyers who came of age after an ideological backlash a generation ago to decades of liberal court rulings. As judges, they tend to rule more consistently for conservative outcomes than older Republican appointees, like the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. And just as in the early decades of the 20th century, when a conservative-dominated Supreme Court repeatedly struck down progressive economic policies like child labor and minimum-wage laws leading up to the New Deal fight, Democrats fear that the new majority will systematically crush their achievements — not just hollowing out past gains like abortion rights, but also striking down programs they hope to enact if they regain power, like expanding Medicare or efforts to curb climate change. For the next few weeks, many Democratic strategists want to change the subject from the Supreme Court, hoping that Republican voters’ passions aroused by the Kavanaugh fight will fade ahead of the midterm elections. Noting that the election is approaching, Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that talk of impeaching Justice Kavanaugh was “premature.” “Talking about it at this point isn’t necessarily healing us and moving us forward,” he said. But Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on “Fox News Sunday” that he intended to help House Republicans in swing districts campaign on the issue over the next month, saying their Democratic opponents should be asked whether they supported impeaching Justice Kavanaugh and “Do you want an outcome so badly that you would basically turn the law upside down?” Still, many liberals are quietly looking forward to reviving the fight if they win a House majority and subpoena power, rather than resigning themselves to waiting for a conservative justice to leave the court. The oldest of the five, Justice Clarence Thomas, is just 70. Many are vowing, for example, to try to uncover more files from Justice Kavanaugh’s time as an official in George W. Bush’s White House in hopes of finding more evidence to support their accusations that he lied under oath about his actions. “We’re going to get those documents that are shielded from view, and they will provide further proof that he lied,” Mr. Fallon said. “And these sexual assault allegations have created a wave of outrage and challenge to the court’s legitimacy that may even eclipse the impact of the lying.” Because of the Presidential Records Act, any Bush administration files that Republicans refused to seek during the confirmation hearings may remain hard for Congress to subpoena until 2021. But the right eventual finding could provide a basis to try to impeach and remove Justice Kavanaugh from the court. “If a careful examination of the entire scope of his legal history — thus far withheld from the Senate — demonstrates that Mr. Kavanaugh lied under oath, the constitutionally prescribed remedy would be impeachment proceedings,” more than three dozen of the most progressive House Democrats wrote to Mr. Trump urging his withdrawal ahead of the confirmation vote. The idea of court packing emerged even before Mr. Trump nominated Justice Kavanaugh. As soon as Justice Kennedy announced his retirement in June, some liberals began calling for Democrats to prepare to expand the court by two justices when they regain power, permitting a future Democratic president and Democratic-controlled Senate to try to transform the court’s controlling faction from its five Republican appointees to six Democratic ones. Still, opening that door could lead Republicans to simply expand the court again when the pendulum swung back, continuing the downward spiral. And Carrie Severino, the chief counsel and policy director of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, deemed it wishful thinking that Democrats would uncover irrefutable evidence of perjury by Justice Kavanaugh. She said it was “inconceivable” that the Senate would convict and remove him, and warned that even such an effort would damage the rule of law by delegitimizing the court as an institution that stands apart from partisan politics. “They are speaking out of anger and frustration, and I hope it is not a way most Democrats would like to go. To say, ‘We’re so angry about losing one fight that we basically destroy the entire institution in a fit of pique,’ that is not going to be helpful to anyone,” she said. “I don’t think they would like that to be the standard applied across the board; I opposed Justice Kagan’s confirmation, but I’m not trying to impeach her.” Indeed, Roosevelt’s court-packing proposal failed to gain support even from his fellow Democrats. Roosevelt should have been more patient, letting the court evolve through elections and natural turnover, William H. Rehnquist, then the chief justice, said in a 1996 speech looking back at that era. “Although Roosevelt lost that battle, he eventually won the war by serving three full terms as president and appointing eight of the nine members of the court,” Chief Justice Rehnquist said. “This simply shows that there is a wrong way and a right way to go about putting a popular imprint on the judiciary.” Still, liberals today are increasingly questioning the legitimacy of the process by which several conservative justices won seats on the court, noted Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution visiting fellow who studies judicial confirmations. For example, many on the left are still seething at Senate Republicans’ refusal to give a hearing in 2016 to Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s last nominee for a vacancy, and consider Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to be occupying a stolen seat. “The conservative majority will include four justices who were appointed by presidents who achieved office despite losing the popular vote, and added to that, the percentage of the voting population represented by Senate Republicans reflects a minority of the overall population,” Mr. Wheeler said. “And then you have the asterisk next to Justice Gorsuch’s name.” Lee Epstein, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies the judiciary, predicted that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., aware of the danger to the court’s legitimacy, would try to guide it into staying quiet for at least several years. “This could be a terrible moment for the court,” she said. “The Republicans aren’t going to be running government forever, and it could lead to the kind of clash that we had in 1936 with Roosevelt. That was a bad moment for the court and a bad moment for the country.” Swiftly after Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation on Saturday, Democrats promised they would be watching closely. “The legitimacy of the Supreme Court can justifiably be questioned,” former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. wrote on Twitter. “The court must now prove — through its work — that it is worthy of the nation’s trust.” In an essay on Vox, the progressive political and policy writer Matthew Yglesias also took note of a line of “optimistic” thinking that Chief Justice Roberts, concerned about preserving the court’s popular legitimacy, could serve as a brake on the other four conservatives — as he did when he voted to uphold part of the Affordable Care Act in 2012. But if the five conservatives stick together and severely circumscribe a future Democratic majority’s ability to govern, he wrote, “Democrats will face some difficult questions about whether to try court-packing or other forms of exotic procedural extremism in order to secure the authority to govern.” In that case, he said, the silver lining for liberals is that Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed, as opposed to being withdrawn and replaced by an untarnished but ideologically similar nominee. The cloud over his presence, Mr. Yglesias predicted, will help the left’s “necessary delegitimization” of the court.",The New York Times

2018,"On ‘More Blood, More Tracks,’ Familiar Bob Dylan Songs Cut Closer to the Bone","Critic’s Notebook Bob Dylan had crucial second thoughts just as he was about to release “Blood on the Tracks,” the indelible 1975 album filled with songs of separation, heartache, sorrow, rage and regret. Now it’s getting a revealing close-up. “More Blood, More Tracks: The Bootleg Series Vol. 14,” due Friday, unveils all of the initial sessions: the solo, duo and small-group versions of songs that Dylan replaced, for half of the album, with more extroverted full-band recordings. There are an exhaustive deluxe six-CD version with every surviving take and a one-CD compilation of alternate versions of the album’s 10 songs plus one that was omitted, “Up to Me.” The songs from “Blood on the Tracks” are artfully multifaceted: romances, travelogues, tall tales, parables and possibly memories, all at once. Although it was written and recorded while Dylan’s marriage to the former Sara Lownds was disintegrating — she filed for divorce in 1977 — he later insisted that its songs, including “Tangled Up in Blue,” “Idiot Wind” and “Shelter from the Storm,” were by no means confessional. In “Chronicles: Volume One,” his elliptical 2004 memoir, he claimed that the lyrics had been inspired by Anton Chekhov short stories. While making the album and tinkering with lyrics, Dylan pared away obvious references to his own career. He set aside “Up to Me,” a song about artistic ambition versus small-mindedness, and he replaced lines from an early take of “Idiot Wind” that complained, “Imitators steal me blind.” Regardless of its origins, listeners through the decades have been riveted by the album’s pain and longing; it’s one of Dylan’s masterpieces. The album Dylan had initially planned to release was recorded in four days in September 1974, in the New York City studio where he had made his first albums: A&R Studios, formerly Columbia Studio A. In that familiar setting he recorded solo, with his acoustic guitar and harmonica, and for one session with a band of folk-rooted sidemen, Eric Weissberg and Deliverance. They finished only one song that satisfied Dylan, “Meet Me in the Morning.” He whittled the band down to just its bassist, Tony Brown, who shadowed Dylan’s idiosyncratic timing with uncanny grace through the remaining sessions, yielding the reflective, almost conspiratorial performances of “Simple Twist of Fate” and “Buckets of Rain” on the original album, along with the busker’s bounce of “You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,” a song about blissful love that can’t help envisioning its end. Dylan brought in two other studio musicians, Paul Griffin on keyboards and Buddy Cage on pedal steel guitar, to add ghostly overlays. Almost all of the songs were in the same key and performed with a bare minimum of backup. So the original “Blood on the Tracks” would have been nearly as sparse as Dylan’s early 1960s solo recordings and his lean, pointedly ascetic 1967 “John Wesley Harding.” But while LP jackets were being printed and advance vinyl pressings were sent out, Dylan decided to revisit the songs with a pickup band of local Minneapolis musicians who were hastily assembled during the last week of December 1974. He had rewritten (and improved) some lyrics, and with more musicians in the room and, perhaps, more distance on the songwriting, he delivered the songs more forcefully, facing them outward rather than inward. When “Blood on the Tracks” was released in January 1975, half of the New York City recordings were replaced with the Minneapolis sessions (although with album covers already printed, that studio band went uncredited). Meanwhile, to give the music a subliminal edge, Dylan had the tracks sped up by 2 to 3 percent, shortening the running times by a few seconds and very slightly raising the pitch. Insiders who had heard the original album mourned what they considered to be a push toward pop. A handful of songs from the New York sessions that trickled out on Dylan’s first Bootleg Series compilations suggested they had a point. “More Blood, More Tracks,” strips away any gloss. In the six-CD package, the takes that appeared on the original album are returned to accurate speed and mixed more austerely, with considerably less reverb around Dylan’s voice and guitar and different balances on band tracks. (The six CDs include all the takes recorded in New York; there are no surviving outtakes from the Minneapolis sessions, but the master tapes are remixed.) The pricey full package also includes a hardcover volume featuring a trove of Dylan lore: a page-by-page reproduction of a spiral notebook of lyrics, full of cross-outs and alternatives. The one-CD version is a well-chosen playlist among many that could traverse the New York sessions. From the beginning, none of the performances on the complete set is tentative or demo-like. Dylan had clearly thought through the songs beforehand, chosen his guitar strategies and decided where the dramatic peaks were. His first performances in the studio were apparently so incandescent that the engineers didn’t pay attention to the sound of his vest buttons clacking against his guitar — the only distraction in his very first take of “Simple Twist of Fate,” which rises from and falls back to a stoic near-whisper, like a startling rumor being passed along. The New York recordings, solo or close to it, bring out the solitude in the songs: The singer endlessly wandering, bereft of the woman he loved, wondering what could have been different, coming to terms with it all. Stripped of arrangements that have been familiar for decades, Dylan’s voice comes through as more insistent, while the lyrics land more sharply. The complicated storyline of “Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts” becomes more immediately comprehensible in a solo performance. And without the Minneapolis band’s organ crescendos, “Idiot Wind” becomes a more private attack, as much plaint as indictment: “You’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above/And I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love.” But in the end, Dylan knew best. The Minneapolis versions unleashed the suppressed anger in “Idiot Wind” and brought the momentum of a band to the long quasi-narratives of songs like “Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts.” The New York versions of the songs were monochromatic and slightly forbidding, and they played down Dylan’s dry humor: “She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced/He helped her out of a jam, I guess, But he used a little too much force,” he sang in early versions of “Tangled Up in Blue,” a song in which he continues to juggle pronouns (I/he) and personae. The Minneapolis arrangement of “Tangled Up in Blue” that opens “Blood on the Tracks” — switched to first-person, transposed to a higher key and ornamented with glimmering guitar strumming — doesn’t telegraph the troubles to come. Instead, it entices an unsuspecting listener into the album’s emotional labyrinths. Dylan was right the first time about his decision to re-record half of “Blood on the Tracks.” But years later, it’s fascinating and illuminating to hear what might have been.",The New York Times
2018,"On ‘S.N.L.,’ Republican Senators Host a Locker Room Celebration for Kavanaugh’s Confirmation","[Looking for TV and movie recommendations? Sign up for our newsletter, Watching.] There were no surprise celebrity guests to come to the rescue of “Saturday Night Live” this weekend — no return visits from Matt Damon as Judge Brett Kavanaugh or Alec Baldwin as President Trump. So the show’s ensemble cast was on its own, for better or for worse, to address Kavanaugh’s contentious confirmation to the Supreme Court in its cold opening, just a few hours after the narrow Senate vote. This broadcast, hosted by the comic actress Awkwafina (“Ocean’s 8,” “Crazy Rich Asians”) — one of the very few Asian women to host the show in its history — and featuring the musical guest Travis Scott, made an oblique acknowledgment of the representation issues that “S.N.L.” frequently faces. The episode also addressed, in comic fashion, a controversial speech that the rapper Kanye West made on set in support of Trump last week after the closing credits rolled. But first, that cold open. In a sketch purporting to be a TV broadcast from a raucous, revelry-filled Republican locker room, Heidi Gardner played the CNN correspondent Dana Bash, quizzing various senators who were cheering Kavanaugh’s appointment. “There a lot of pacemakers being put to the test tonight,” she said. Beck Bennett, playing Mitch McConnell, declared, “Republicans read the mood of the country and we could tell that people really wanted Kavanaugh. Everyone’s pumped, from white men over 60 to white men over 70.” Kate McKinnon, returning as Lindsey Graham, proudly asked, “How amazing is this? We made a lot of women real worried today, but I’m not getting pregnant so I don’t care.” Cecily Strong appeared as Susan Collins, who announced her support for Kavanaugh in a speech on Friday afternoon. “Oh please, the last thing I wanted was to make this about me,” Strong said. “That’s why I told everyone to tune in at 3 p.m., so I could tell all my female supporters: Psych!” She added that she and her colleagues were “going to party like it’s 2020 when Susan Rice takes my seat.” Representing the Democratic side of the aisle, Alex Moffat played Chuck Schumer, who observed, “We thought this time would be better than the Anita Hill hearing, because Dr. Ford was white. But then it turned out Brett Kavanaugh was white too, and we were completely blindsided by that.” In other memorable moments from the show: Kanye West Rebuttal of the Week In a monologue delivered from the “Weekend Update” desk, cast member Pete Davidson responded to West’s off-air speech, in which the rapper wore a red “Make America Great Again” hat and said that Democrats planned “to take the fathers out the home and promote welfare.” Davidson stated that “what Kanye said after we went off the air last week was one of the worst, most awkward things I’ve ever seen here — and I’ve seen Chevy Chase speak to an intern.” He denied that anyone had discouraged West from wearing his MAGA hat, saying, “I wish I had bullied you. I wish I would have suggested that it might upset some people, like your wife or every black person, ever.” Addressing West’s political observations, Davidson said, “Um, do you know how wrong you have to be about politics for, like, me to notice? Do you know how annoying that is? Kanye is a genius, but a musical genius. Like, Joey Chestnut is a hot-dog-eating genius. But I don’t want to hear Joey Chestnut’s opinion about things that aren’t hot-dog related.” Davidson, who has previously spoken on “S.N.L.” about his own efforts to achieve mental health, said that he was taking medication and encouraged West to do the same. He used a crude term for “fool” to refer to West, and stated that “Being mentally ill is not an excuse to act” in such a manner. As he concluded his segment, Davidson put on his own red cap that said: “Make Kanye 2006 Again.” Nostalgic Monologue of the Week Awkwafina concluded her opening monologue with a tribute to Lucy Liu, who hosted “S.N.L.” in 2000, shortly after the release of “Charlie’s Angels.” As Awkwafina explained: Back in 2000, I came here to 30 Rock and waited outside when my idol, Lucy Liu, hosted “S.N.L.” I was a kid — yes — I was a kid, I didn’t have a ticket so I knew I wasn’t getting in. But I just wanted to be near the building. And I remember how important that episode was for me and how it totally changed what I thought was possible for an Asian-American woman. Standing here tonight is a dream I never thought would come true. So, thank you, Lucy, for opening the door. I wasn’t able to make it in the building back then, but 18 years later, I am hosting the show. I love you, Lucy Liu. [Catch up on the week in pop culture here.] Technological Innovation of the Week A filmed segment poked fun at Wednesday’s test of the “Presidential Alert” system, intended for use in national emergencies, as busy citizens were barraged with other, far less consequential messages delivered over the text-messaging system: “Failing New York Times Says I Cheated on Taxes. Duh! It’s called being smart!” “Puerto Rico is fine now! I guess the paper towels worked!” In a twist ending, the segment was revealed as a commercial for Cricket Wireless, boasting, “Now aren’t you happy we have awful service?” ‘Weekend Update’ Jokes of the Week At the “Weekend Update” desk, anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the Kavanaugh confirmation. Jost: Even if you look past Dr. Ford’s testimony, which many people seem to have no trouble doing, Kavanaugh did a bunch of disqualifying stuff, just this past week. He basically lied under oath at a job interview to become a judge. That’s like cheating on your wife during your wedding. And then after he went full “Do you know who my father is?” at the confirmation hearing, he had to publish an apology letter in The Wall Street Journal, which is something A.A. calls “Step 9.” Che: My question is for the five out of six Republican women that voted for Kavanaugh. So are y’all like hostages? This feels like one of those horror movies where the white lady’s in love with the monster but doesn’t know it. And all the black people watching are like, “Aw, man, you about to get ate.” This is not good for any of us. And I say us, because if these Republicans don’t care about you, they definitely don’t care about me. If a white lady in tears can’t get justice, then there’s no hope for my black [expletive] in Jordans. Jost: I’m also angry at Democrats like Cory Booker, who came out and called Brett Kavanaugh evil when his nomination was first announced. Then when he was accused of actual evil, they had nowhere to go. It’s like seeing O.J. do a Hertz commercial in the ’80s, and saying, “This is the worst thing he’ll ever do.” ‘Weekend Update’ Characters of the Week Reprising their frequent roles as Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Alex Moffat and Mikey Day returned to the “Weekend Update” desk of “S.N.L.,” which Day mockingly said stood for “Saturday Night Liberals.” With the midterm elections approaching, the actors playing the Trump sons said that they had both been given important assignments by their father. “He asked me to stump for Republicans on the campaign trail,” Day said. Moffat: “And he asked me not to do that.” Day: “That’s right, bud. You get to stay home and watch all the action on TV.” Threatening to take the “Update” chair away from Jost, Day said, “I’ve got some jokes I can tell.” Moffat: “Me, too. What did the gay black Jew — ” Day: “No, don’t tell that, no. No. You can’t tell that joke.” Moffat: “But dad does.”",The New York Times
2018,"Once Lowly, Carignan Finds Favor in California","Wine School For one of the most widely grown red grapes in the world, carignan is perhaps among the least known and most misunderstood. Most likely it originated in Spain, where it is known as both mazuelo and cariñena, but carignan is far more common in France, particularly in the south, where it has been grown in high volume and used primarily as a blending grape in inexpensive plonk. When produced mainly for quantity, carignan can produce wines that are screechy, tannic and high in alcohol. Such wines formed the general impression of carignan and earned the grape a fair amount of contempt. But when farmed and vinified carefully, carignan can produce wines that can be intriguing and delicious, particularly when the grapes come from old, low-yielding vines. At the high end, excellent carignan-based reds have come from Priorat and Sardinia, and I’ve had carignans from Languedoc that have been quite good. Carignan has also been an essential component to old field-blend wines from California (where it is sometimes spelled carignane), along with zinfandel, cinsault, petite sirah, grenache and others. In recent years, a small number of winemakers, particularly those without vineyards or resources to buy higher-end grapes, have been seeking out old-vine carignan in California and turning it into very good wines. At the same time, established producers like Ridge, Ravenswood and Cline have regularly made small amounts of carignan. This month we will explore California carignan in an effort to get to know the grape and to understand what some producers are doing with it. The three wines I recommend are: LIOCO MENDOCINO CARIGNAN SATIVA 2015 $30 PORTER CREEK MENDOCINO CARIGNANE OLD VINE 2015 $27 BROC CELLARS ALEXANDER VALLEY CARIGNAN OLD VINE 2016 $30 As is often the case, these wines are made in small quantities. Other fine producers well worth seeking out include Amplify, Vinca Minor, J. Brix, Hobo Wine, Calder, Las Jaras, Pax, Folk Machine, Sandlands, Ridge, Ravenswood, Cline and Ruth Lewandowski. My guess is these wines will go well with meaty dishes, whether beef, lamb or pork, and since it is getting to be that time of the year, you might enjoy it with turkey as well. You know the drill: Give these wines just enough of a chill to approximate the temperature of a cool cellar.",The New York Times
2018,"Once Paralyzed, Three Men Take Steps Again With Spinal Implant","An experimental, pacemaker-like device offers hope for treating spinal injuries. David Mzee broke his neck in 2010. He was a college student in Zurich at the time, an athlete who enjoyed risk and contact, and he flipped off a trampoline and onto a foam pad. “The foam pad, it didn’t do its job,” he said. Mr. Mzee, now 33, is one of three men who lost the use of their legs years ago after severe spinal injuries, but who now are able to walk without any supports, if briefly and awkwardly, with the help of a pacemaker-like implant, scientists reported on Wednesday. The breakthrough is the latest achievement in the scientific effort to understand and treat such life-changing injuries. Several recent studies have restored motion to paralyzed or partly paralyzed patients by applying continuous electrical stimulation to the spinal cord. The new report, described in the journal Nature, is the first demonstration of so-called patterned stimulation: An implant sends bursts of targeted stimulation to the muscles that intend to move. In effect, the stimulation occurs on an as-needed basis, roughly mimicking the body’s own signaling mechanism. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The treatment is still experimental, and its effectiveness for others with complete or partial paralysis is yet to be worked out. The three men had some sensation in their legs before the trial began, and they needed months of intensive training to achieve their first awkward steps. They still rely on wheelchairs; two can walk out in the community, using walkers. Each of them has learned to move previously limp muscles without help from the implant — an indication that the electrical stimulation prompted nerves to regrow. “At first everything was new and, of course, exciting, but it took so much work to see any difference,” said Mr. Mzee. “I would go home after rehab, eat, then go straight to bed. Then it got easier to get the movement I wanted, and the biggest step for me was when I could move hands free, for the first time, on the treadmill. I wasn’t able to do that for so many years; it was a really cool feeling.” Chet Moritz, a brain scientist at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the study, was impressed by the results. “The exciting thing about these findings is that they hold out the promise that spinal cord injuries can be cured, to an extent that restores walking, and that many movements persist even when stimulation is turned off,” he said. Other researchers cautioned that the study was small, and that the patients were only partly paralyzed. “We’re still a long way from people being able to access this as standard medical care,” said Dr. Kimberly Anderson, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, although she added that the approach had great potential. In recent years, researchers have used brain implants — electrode chips, placed below the skull on the motor area of the cortex — to decode neural signals and restore movement in people and nonhuman primates who have lost the use of limbs. Still other scientists are investigating nerve growth factors, chemical compounds that are injected at the site of an injury to promote repair. The authors of the new report, who are based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Lausanne, previously had demonstrated that rats that had lost the use of their hind legs could be trained to run again when continuous current was applied through the spinal cord to the muscles. Other research teams recently have reported that continuous stimulation could also restore some movement in human patients. But in people, continuous stimulation seems to send mixed signals to the muscles, activating some and confusing others, the authors of the new study argue in a companion paper in the current issue of Nature Neuroscience. The three men in the new trial showed more rapid improvements than did most subjects in previous trials, but their injuries were also less severe. “The key now will be to optimize this technology and the positions for the nerve connections,” said Gregoire Courtine, the senior author of the new report in Nature. “When you haven’t walked for many years, you have to learn to walk again.” The treatment of the men began with surgery. Doctors implanted a small patch of electrodes on the surface of the spinal cord in the lower back, below where each injury had occurred. The patch was connected to a pacemaker device, which was placed in the abdomen. The implanted device, when turned on, delivered bursts of stimulation to individual muscles as they were called into use. The intention to lift a knee generated a certain pattern of nerve firing; stepping forward generated a different one. In effect, the device provided the pattern of stimulation that the body delivered before the injury occurred. Over time — with intensive physical therapy, on a treadmill with hand supports — the stimulation appeared to engage the brain’s motor cortex through nerves that were spared from injury, Dr. Courtine said. “In the animal studies, the reorganization in the brain was really massive,” Dr. Courtine said. “There were a lot of new connections from the motor cortex to brain stem.” The same would be expected in humans, he said. After his injury, Mr. Mzee began playing wheelchair rugby, and soon made the national team. The injury also plunged him into research of his own; through a doctor, he learned of the program in Lausanne, and the animal experiments. When he heard that a human trial was in the works, he quickly enlisted. “It’s really hard to say what’s coming next for me,” Mr. Mzee said. “I think the next step will have to be a huge one, and one of the problems is that I have to have some trunk control. My trunk is not well-balanced. I’m trying to set up a body support system at home to do more rehab but, you know, it’s expensive. I’m still not steady without those supports.” Even so, rehab — the hard work, sweat and discipline that have proved so helpful for many patients — will be essential to the recovery process. “We’ve known for years that people” with partial paralysis can respond to rehabilitation, Dr. Anderson said. “The problem comes down to access; long-term rehabilitation in the chronic setting is not paid for by very many insurers. As a result, most people with motor incomplete injuries do not recover to their fullest potential.”",The New York Times
2018,Once Upon a Time in Montana,"A traveler returns to his old town, where he’s tasked with watching over a just-perished stranger. “She was tiny, frail, the size of a child, wearing a white nightgown. The dead woman’s white hair was all loose, spread around her wrinkled face.”CreditCreditPhotograph by Richard Barnes. Set design by Jill Nicholls T’s Nov. 11 Travel issue is dedicated to a series of five fairy tales written exclusively for us — the kinds of stories that will inspire your own adventures, if not of the body, then at least of the mind. Read more in our letter from the editor. This story is inspired by “The Legends of Tono” a collection of 119 Japanese folk tales published by Kunio Yanagita (1875-1962) in 1910. The 101st tale involves a traveler who visits a friend’s home and ends up watching over a dead body. A TRAVELER WAS passing through a Montana town late one night. He had once lived here, in a white house that he now walked past again and again. The shapes and shadows in the windows of this house he imagined to be his own, and that of the young woman he’d lived with at that time — as if they had not moved away, had not parted, had settled here and perhaps started a family together. Later, he walked past the restaurant where this young woman had worked, then the bowling alley where she had also been employed. The moon rose, round and pale. The train yard was empty. A distant dog barked; another answered. Still later, he passed a nursing home, a memory-care unit where another woman he knew now lived. He had once worked for this woman, tending animals on her ranch; if he were to visit her this evening, she would not likely remember his name or anything about him. Her mind had forgotten most everything it had known, and yet her body remained behind, eating and sleeping and waking each morning. In the final letter the traveler had received from this old woman, a few years before, she had said that one night, while in bed, she’d heard a clattering in her kitchen, cupboards slapped open, metal pots and pans bouncing on the floor. In her nightgown, she had leapt from bed and seized a broom to confront the intruder. Standing in her kitchen was a large grizzly bear; it stared at her for a moment, then leapt out the broken door. Cattle scattered as the bear bounded across the pasture toward the trees. Read more: a guide to Livingston, Mont., near where this story is set. The traveler, aware of the declining state of the woman’s mind, was not certain whether to believe her story. A few weeks later, however, her granddaughter sent him a photograph of a round trailer, set outside the old woman’s house, in which the bear, upon its return to the kitchen, had been captured and driven far away. It was as if that bear was drawn to her, the granddaughter wrote, as if she called it. Remembering this story, the traveler had lost track of where he was walking. He now found himself out along the Yellowstone River and, before long, in another landscape. The earth here was humped up in mounds, white pipes twisted from the ground. This was a place where people had prepared for the end of the world, and yet the world had not ended, or had not seemed to. They had left all these shelters behind. The traveler shivered, walking atop these hidden rooms, feeling their emptiness beneath him. It grew still later, and he was tired. Fortunately, he saw smoke twisting up against the night sky, and he walked toward it. He came, before long, to a heavy door set into the side of a low mound. He knocked upon the door with his fist, and then with a stone. Faint footsteps approached, a click as the lock turned. The door swung inward with a scraping sound. “Hello!” his friend said. “You have come at just the right moment.” “Can I rest here?” the traveler asked. “I’ve been walking.” “Of course,” his friend said. “Come in! Someone just died this evening, and I was wondering what to do. There is no one here to watch things while I go out. Would you mind watching over things for a bit?” Before the traveler could respond, his friend slapped him on the back and disappeared down a zigzagging path into the darkness. The traveler closed the door, then proceeded to a stairway that was actually a ladder, which he had to descend backward. When he turned around at the bottom, he saw the fire in the hearth, the chair waiting before it. He sat down, unlaced his boots, and took them off. On the small table next to the chair was a mug of peppermint tea, still warm. He took a drink, then looked around. The dead person appeared to be an old woman, and she was laid out on a bed in the adjoining room. His friend had not thought to close the door, or had left it open on purpose. Why was it necessary for the dead to be watched? And what were the consequences if they were not watched? The traveler decided not to close the door; he drank the tea and stared into the fire, keeping the dead woman in his peripheral vision. Again, he shivered. Would it be less unsettling, perhaps, if there were more than one dead person? If her face were covered? If the dead person were someone he’d known when alive, would that be more or less disturbing? Standing, the traveler stepped away from the fire, through the doorway, and stood at the foot of the bed where the woman had been laid to rest. (Was she resting? Why were the dead put in beds? Why was a blanket pulled up to her waist? To keep her warm?) She was tiny, frail, the size of a child, wearing a white nightgown. Her bare gray forearms were crossed on her chest, her thin knotty fingers on her shoulders. The dead woman’s white hair was all loose, spread around her wrinkled face. Her eyes were closed. The traveler was certain he had not known this woman. Relieved, he stepped back through the doorway, leaving it open and, adding wood to the fire, sat down again. He picked up a notebook and saw that his friend had been studying calligraphy, writing the whole alphabet again and again in complicated letters. The hour was late. The traveler stretched out his legs and closed his eyes. Just as he began to doze, he was startled by the ringing of a telephone. He had not noticed the telephone before, and it took a moment to locate it — yellow, affixed to the wall, its tangled cord dangling. It rang and rang, and in that moment, he expected the old woman to rise and answer it. Turning quickly, he saw that she had not moved, was lying exactly as she had been. When the telephone ceased ringing, the silence tightened around the traveler. AND WHEN, a moment later, the telephone resumed its ringing, he knew it was a signal to him, a sign that he was supposed to answer it. At once, he realized it was the woman calling, the woman with whom he’d lived in the white house, long before. She had somehow sensed that he’d returned to this place, was compelled to call him and was now going to tell him what he needed to know. He jerked the handset from the wall. “Hello?” “What are you doing there?” she said. Her voice had changed, or it wasn’t her voice. In fact, it was an old woman’s voice, raspy and faint. “It’s difficult to talk to you,” she said, “from where I am. But I felt you moving around nearby. Are you finding your way by now?” The traveler turned, the telephone’s cord twisting around his arm. Through the doorway, he could see the dead woman on the bed. While he heard her voice in his ear, her lips were still, not moving at all. “Are you here?” he said. “Where?” she said. “Of course I’m here.” “What is it like, where you are?” “It’s a comfortable room,” she said, and coughed for a time before regaining her voice. “There are machines here, and some days I go out and look at the sky.” “Is it a sky like our sky, here?” he said. “What do you mean?” “With clouds,” he said. “And the sun and the moon.” “Of course,” she said. “It’s all just the same.” “So your body is here, and you are there?” “Pardon me?” she said. “I guess I always assumed,” he said, “that the land of the dead would have a different sky, if it had a sky.” “What are you talking about?” she said, her voice in his ear, her body motionless through the doorway. “You think I’m dead?” “I stood right next to you and couldn’t see you breathing. I can see you now and you’re not moving at all.” “You can see me?” she said. “Where are you? I don’t think you can see me. But I felt you were close today, when I was here, in my room with the machines, I sensed you were close, perhaps walking past the building. Why didn’t you come visit me?” “I’m sorry,” he said. “I thought you were someone else.” “I am someone else,” she said. “I mean on the phone,” he said, “someone else calling on the phone.” “I’m different than I was,” she said, “back when you worked for me, but I still remember some things, sometimes.” “How did you call me, or know I’d be here?” “I dialed the numbers,” she said. “Earlier,” he said, “I was thinking of you. That story about the bear in the kitchen — you must have felt that, that’s what you felt.” “What story is that?” she said. “A bear? You think I’m a bear?” “No,” he said. “Why didn’t you visit me?” “I will,” he said. “If I don’t remember you,” she said, “that doesn’t mean it’s not a successful visit. My body’s here, but sometimes my mind is not. It’s shrinking down on itself to become more like an animal’s mind. So I am and I am not the same person. In a case like mine, it’s difficult for people to know how to visit, or how to grieve, or when.” “I’ll come,” he said. “Perhaps in the morning?” “When will I truly be gone?” she said. “When will we know?” With that, she hung up the phone. The traveler unwound the cord from his arm, which had fallen asleep, and sat down in the chair once again. Silence gathered. The logs in the fire collapsed, settled into coals. JUST AS THE TRAVELER was about to sleep, at the edge of his vision he saw the woman in the bed slowly sit up and turn her head toward him. He was panic-stricken but controlled himself, not immediately looking straight in her direction. Neither spoke, and in that silence, he realized that the old woman — her eyes open now, reflecting the firelight — was not looking at him but past him, across the room. In the far wall, up by the ceiling, which was at the level of the ground outside, was a window. In that window, the traveler could see something like a fox’s head, its eyes staring fixedly at the dead woman, who was staring back. Carefully, the traveler dropped to the floor and crawled slowly to the ladder and climbed from the room to the door. Outside, he crept around until he saw, in the moonlight, that it actually was a fox, flattened on the ground with its head stuck down into the window and its hind legs stretched out straight. The traveler snatched up a piece of pipe and began beating the fox, meaning to kill it, to break the connection with the old woman, but the fox leapt away, escaped into the night. Next, the traveler bent down and peered through the window. Once again, the old woman was lying flat on the bed, deceased. The fire glowed on the empty chair, on his boots with their laces scribbling across the floor. The traveler filled the window with stones, to prevent the fox’s return, then walked back to the door. He went through it, turned and descended the ladder. The traveler’s friend, returning home the next morning, found the traveler fast asleep, lying in the bed next to the dead woman. The woman’s white hair was so knotted and tangled with that of the traveler that it required a very sharp knife to sever them, one from the other. Hair: Nikki Nelms.

2018,"Once at Guantánamo, 5 Senior Taliban Members Now Join Political Office in Qatar","KABUL, Afghanistan — Five senior Taliban members who spent years in the American prison camp at Guantánamo Bay have joined the insurgency’s political office in Qatar at a time when that delegation has been at the center of American efforts to start a peace process, Taliban officials said Wednesday. The five high-ranking members of the original Taliban movement — including the chief of the Taliban government’s army, a minister, a deputy intelligence chief, and two governors — were released in 2014 in exchange for an American soldier held by the insurgency, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The five were shifted to Qatar, where officials say about three dozen Taliban leaders live with their families, and remained under watch of that country’s government. Their joining of the Taliban’s political commission, which will bring them more freedom of movement, comes days after the insurgency’s longtime deputy, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was also released back to the Taliban ranks. Mullah Baradar was arrested in a joint Pakistani-American raid in 2010 and had remained in Pakistani detention. The recent developments follow two rounds of meetings between the Taliban and top American diplomats, after the Trump administration ordered direct contacts to try to jump-start an Afghan peace process. It remains unclear how much effect the release of Mullah Baradar and the joining of the other senior five members, which was confirmed by a Taliban statement, will have on initiating a peace process. Although all six men were once senior leaders, and among the early members of the Taliban movement that came to power in the mid 1990s, they have been out of the ranks for a long time. During their absence, the Taliban have gone through two leadership transitions. Their return to the fold could be seen as an effort to balance the influence of Sarajuddin Haqqani, the Taliban deputy and heir to his father’s Haqqani militant network, who as operations commander has been behind some of the most brutal attacks of the war. Even as the drive for peace talks has taken on urgency, violence has continued at an intense pace. In the Afghan capital, Kabul, a suicide bomber detonated explosives on Wednesday outside the Pul-e-Charkhi prison, killing at least five people, according to health officials. Local news media reports said the bomber had targeted a bus carrying prison workers. In the southern province of Uruzgan, chaotic violence continued into a fourth day, killing at least 21 people, government officials there said. The nature of the violence, in a district called Khas Uruzgan, was not precisely clear, but officials said it was clashes between the Taliban and an abusive local commander named Hakim Shujaee. Hundreds of families have been trapped by the fighting or displaced from their homes. In the western province of Farah, an Afghan Army helicopter crashed, killing 25 people on board, according to Mohammed Naseer Mehri, a spokesman for the governor there. Among the dead were senior officials, including members of the provincial council and security commanders. Although the Taliban claimed they had targeted the helicopter, Mr. Mehri said there was no enemy action involved in the incident. Despite some suggestions that the return of the older generation Taliban at a time when the new leadership had just strengthened its grip largely through battlefield gains might cause insecurities, field commanders were adamant it would have no such effect. “These people can play a positive role in politics, and they are deeply respected by the leadership,” said Mullah Shirin Hameedi, a Taliban commander in the south who once served as chief of security to the group’s founding leader. “If the leadership had fears from them, they would not be allowed into politics. We are all committed to our mission, whether old or new.” Borhan Osman, the senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, said it was not clear how deep the American role in both the release of Mullah Baradar and expanded freedom for the so-called Guantánamo Five was. But he said both could be seen as a result of recent momentum toward talks among both the Americans and Taliban, along with some improved cooperation from Pakistan. “For a long time, there have been questions among the Taliban — that the five were released from Guantánamo but then their freedom was restricted in Doha,” Mr. Osman said, referring to Qatar’s capital. “Some viewed their transfer to Qatar as no big victory. Their return to the scene, in whatever capacity, might ease those concerns.” Mr. Osman said that internal conversations among the Taliban in recent months suggested they wanted to strengthen their negotiating team in Qatar, and “injecting the five was the most natural and rational way” to bolster the team. On the sidelines of a counterterrorism conference in Doha, Mutlaq bin Majed al-Qahtani, Qatar’s special envoy for counterterrorism and mediation of conflict resolution, praised the Trump administration for deciding to have direct talks with the Taliban, saying there was “no military solution” that would bring peace and stability to Afghanistan after 17 years of war. Emphasizing that each side in any peace talks gets to decide who will represent it, Mr. Qahtani suggested it had been the Taliban’s decision to ask the former Guantánamo detainees to be part of its formal delegation at its office in Doha. “This is not our decision,” he said. “This is not the decision of the U.S. government. This is their decision to nominate who they think is better to negotiate on their behalf.” But he pointed to the former Guantánamo detainees’ senior roles in the Taliban before their capture as a reason to see their participation in the peace talks as a good thing. “Bearing in mind the role these guys used to have, maybe, maybe they could play a positive role in the national reconciliation and in the peace process in Afghanistan,” Mr. Qahtani said. “My understanding is that the government of Afghanistan had no objection to this. They understand the reason. We hope the Americans have the same hope this new development will add value to the office, to the Taliban delegation.”",The New York Times
2018,"One Killing, Two Accounts: What We Know About Jamal Khashoggi’s Death","BEIRUT, Lebanon — Eighteen days after the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, his government has finally laid out its narrative of what happened. President Trump appears to be giving the Saudis the benefit of the doubt, but many others, including friends of Mr. Khashoggi’s and Turkish and American officials, aren’t buying it. What happened to Mr. Khashoggi on Oct. 2 remains open for debate in part because of how details have become public. Turkey’s leaders have largely refrained from publicly accusing the Saudis, but the country’s security officials have leaked a stream of details that reflect a grisly murder. In their telling, doled out in anonymous statements to the news media, Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the consulate by a 15-man team sent from Riyadh for that very purpose. Saudi Arabia’s new account suggests that those men sought to bring Mr. Khashoggi back to his home country, but that when he resisted, a fight broke out and he was put in a deadly chokehold. Many of the details in the Saudi story were also provided anonymously. So how do the competing narratives stack up? Here are some of the questions the story lines raise. Nobody seems to know. The Turks have said that Mr. Khashoggi’s body was cut up by an autopsy specialist with a bone saw before being carried out of the consulate in large suitcases and disposed of in an unknown location, perhaps a forest. A Saudi official, however, said the team handed over Mr. Khashoggi’s body to a local “collaborator” to dispose. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not disclose the person’s nationality, a detail the team could seemingly provide easily. Some have speculated that the introduction of this unknown person could allow the Saudis to duck responsibility for the state of Mr. Khashoggi’s corpse if and when it is found. The Saudis could argue they weren’t involved. Turkish officials said Saturday that they expected to find the body soon. Little concrete evidence has been made public by either side, although the Turks have provided much more detail to back up their narrative than the Saudis have. The Turkish information included names of the members of the Saudi team and photos of them at the airport, in their hotels and near the consulate. Many of the men have ties to the Saudi military and security services. The New York Times was able to corroborate the identities of most of the men on the team and to establish that at least four had frequently traveled abroad with the country’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as part of his security detail. They included Gen. Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, an intelligence officer who had been photographed near the crown prince during visits to Paris, Madrid, Houston, Boston and the United Nations. Another suspect, Salah al-Tubaigy, is a renowned Saudi autopsy specialist with ties to the security forces. The Saudi official confirmed that both were part of the 15-man team, but said that Dr. Tubaigy was tapped not for his expertise in dealing with dead bodies, but rather for his experience in forensics and his skill in removing evidence from crime scenes. The Saudi official said the Turks had mostly succeeded in identifying the members of the team, although there had been some mistakes that he attributed to name spellings. He did not provide the identities of the rest of the team. In the 18 days after Mr. Khashoggi went missing, Saudi officials repeatedly denied any knowledge of his whereabouts and said that he had left the consulate. A summary of the timeline: Oct. 5: Crown Prince Mohammed told journalists from Bloomberg that Mr. Khashoggi had left the consulate after “a few minutes or one hour.” Oct. 6: The Saudi consul walked reporters from Reuters around the consulate, letting them peek in cupboards, air conditioning units and toilets to show that Mr. Khashoggi was not there. “We are worried about this case,” the consul said. Oct. 9: The Saudi ambassador to the United States, Khalid bin Salman, wrote that reports of Mr. Khashoggi being detained or killed were “absolutely false, and baseless.” It was not until Saturday — 18 days after Mr. Khashoggi went missing — that the Saudis acknowledged that he had been killed inside the consulate by Saudi agents. Seeking to explain the delay, the Saudi official said the team members had tried to cover up Mr. Khashoggi’s killing for fear they would get in trouble. It was only after Turkish officials suggested he had been killed that their superiors investigated and learned of the killing. Why the team had not been required to report the mission’s outcome to its superiors remains unclear. Before Dr. Tubaigy was publicly identified, Turkish officials said that someone with his expertise was part of the Saudi team and that the person had entered the country with a bone saw, a common implement in autopsies. Dr. Tubaigy used the saw to dismember Mr. Khashoggi’s corpse while listening to music and encouraging his colleagues to do the same, Turkish officials said when they released details from a purported audio recording. Not true, said the Saudis. “There was absolutely no bone saw,” the Saudi official said. Dr. Tubaigy had been on hand in case evidence like fingerprints needed to be removed, the official said. It is still unclear. Turkish officials have suggested at various points that they had both video and audio of Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. Now, the Turks say they have audio, the source of some of the more lurid details they have given about the killing. But they have not made the audio public nor shared it with the intelligence agencies of other countries, like the United States. That could be for a variety of reasons: because it doesn’t exist; because the Turks consider it the ultimate trump card to quash the Saudi narrative; or because they don’t want to acknowledge they had bugged the Saudi Consulate. That would be a violation of diplomatic protocol and could embarrass Turkey. Saudi Arabia denies that its leaders ordered the operation against Mr. Khashoggi or even knew that it had taken place until days later. The kingdom’s intelligence service had a general order to bring dissidents home, according to the Saudi official, but the directive in Mr. Khashoggi’s case grew more aggressive as it made its way down the chain of command. But many Turkish and American officials doubt that such an elaborate operation could have been orchestrated without the knowledge of Prince Mohammed, who has consolidated considerable power. The operation involved two private jets from a company linked to the Saudi royal family and a number of the 15 men named as suspects had close ties to the crown prince. “It’s impossible that a crime would take place in any country’s consulate — especially, according to allegations, one committed by public workers — without the knowledge of that country’s officials,” said Numan Kurtulmuş, the acting chairman of Turkey’s governing Justice and Development Party. Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia have vowed to keep searching until the truth is revealed, although it is unclear how long that will take and if their dueling narratives will eventually converge. “We will not allow things to remain covered,” said Omer Celik, a spokesman for Turkey’s governing party. “We will use all the opportunities that we have to reveal what happened, and this is the intention of our president.” Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor said Saturday that the kingdom’s inquiry would continue in order to “uncover and announce all the facts and to hold accountable all those involved in this case and bring them to justice.” But there are few examples of Saudi Arabian authorities investigating themselves and holding leaders from the powerful royal family accountable.",The New York Times
2018,One Preservationist’s Quest to Find Where a Wall in a Landmark Building Went,"Grace Notes New York is the city that never sleeps, according to the lyric made famous by Liza Minnelli and then Frank Sinatra. It is the city that never stops tearing itself down and building itself back up, bigger and taller than before. It is also the city with residents so passionate about its past that they never stop fighting to preserve things — large structures like Grand Central Terminal and small ones like a single, not very big wall. Even when they discover the original wall no longer exists. That will explain Theodore Grunewald’s latest crusade. He is a preservationist who has a past with 510 Fifth Avenue in the heart of Manhattan — “the ultimate glass building,” he calls it. Originally a Manufacturers Trust Company bank branch, it is a cube from the 1950s that had a very visible vault. The escalators were the one diagonal line that slashed across the straight lines of the exterior framework. Some architectural historians mention it in the same breath as two other famous modernist buildings from the same period, the Seagram Building or Lever House. Mr. Grunewald’s past includes a lawsuit that named the building’s owner, Vornado Realty Trust, as well as the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission, in 2011. The issue then was how much of the building Vornado could redo — and whether it had disregarded the commission’s restrictions. Vornado, which had bought the building in 2010, wanted to install two stores in the space that the bank had vacated. A settlement allowed Vornado to move the escalators, among other things. Mr. Grunewald remains unhappy about that. He considers the escalators an essential part of the building’s design. Now, according to an application that Vornado has filed with the landmarks commission, Vornado wants to install a glass wall in the lobby leading to elevators and office space on the upper floors. Zodet Negrón, a spokeswoman for the commission, said members of its staff would meet with Vornado’s representatives to look at drawings and discuss the plan. Mr. Grunewald said there was just one problem with Vornado’s plan. The glass wall that was there when the building was built is long gone, he said, and there is no way to know how faithful Vornado’s plan is to the original. “It may or may not match what was originally there,” he said. What happened to it is the kind of mystery that animates Mr. Grunewald, who has spent hours poring over photographs and reviewing documents about the building. He wondered whether someone on the commission’s staff gave approval without referring the matter to the full commission. He said the wall must have been taken down after the interior was given landmark status in 2011, and 14 years after the exterior was designated a landmark. He called the removal of the wall “the de facto de-landmarking of a designated interior.” “Yes, it’s a very, very small part of a very, very important International Style monument, but when you’re talking about International Style minimalism, the smallest details become critically important,” Mr. Grunewald said of the wall. “When you tinker with these defining elements in a landmark interior, you suck the essence out of the design, and when you take away too much, you lose the essence of the building.” The landmarks commission held a hearing on Vornado’s plan to redo the wall in April. But that was before Mr. Grunewald stopped by the building and realized that the wall, shown in photographs from the 1950s, was gone. What he saw behind the desk where a guard sits is a plain white wall with a doorway. (A spokesman for Vornado said he had no comment.) From the beginning, the building was different from banks that had come before it. Where banks had been fortresslike, with thick walls and sanctuarylike windows, this one was almost all glass, making transparency an attribute when most banks were designed to look like symbols of strength. “The interior is the exterior,” said Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council, a preservation group. The bank’s vault was on full view from Fifth Avenue, as much an art object as a repository for whatever customers stowed in the safe deposit boxes. Like everything else about the building, the vault had an impressive pedigree: It was designed by Henry Dreyfuss, whose credits also include the slim, modernistic Princess telephone. A more conventional building had been commissioned in the mid-1940s, but with wartime restrictions on some building materials, the plans languished until the early 1950s, when the government finally said the builders could use the steel called for in the blueprints. But by then, the bank had fired the original architect in a dispute over billing and had hired Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which had designed Lever House. The architect was Gordon Bunshaft, who, 20 years later, designed the sloping W.R. Grace building down the block on 43rd Street from the bank building. The bank building “is in every architecture book all over the world,” Mr. Grunewald said. “Everyone knows ‘Manny Hanny.’” Maybe, maybe not, but calling it “Manny Hanny” is, technically, wrong. The building opened in 1954 as a branch of the Manufacturers Trust Company, which did not merge with the Hanover Bank until 1961. Over the years, after other bank mergers, it became a JPMorgan Chase branch before it was sold to Vornado in 2010. Vornado received permission to cut new doorways on Fifth Avenue in 2011 — until then, the only entrances had been on 43rd Street — and to move the escalators. The changes allowed Vornado to create spaces for the stores, one occupying about half of the first floor, the other filling the other half and all of the second. Vornado promised not to build above the building, which is only five stories tall. Mr. Grunewald is still rankled that the facade was altered. “Bunshaft”— the architect — “intentionally created this oblique entrance on 43rd Street because nothing expresses power more than the ability to display it but not use it,” Mr. Grunewald said. “Having an entrance on Fifth Avenue was the obvious thing to do. Bunshaft didn’t want to do the obvious thing.” And then there was the vault. Mr. Bankoff of the Historic Districts Council said it had been a central feature of the building when it was a bank, but the room with the safe deposit boxes had been removed. That left little more than the huge, silver vault door — “a stage set,” he called it. Mr. Grunewald echoed that idea, calling the vault “just an artifact now,” he said. “It’s just a big door.” He sighed. “Someday, someone will say, ‘This building was a masterpiece — let’s put things back the way they should be,’” he said. He sighed again. “It will probably be after my lifetime.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | One Way to Stay Cool,"The Trump administration can decrease global warming by improving refrigerators and air-conditioners. Ms. Lerner is an environmental reporter for The Intercept. The report released recently by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change laid out the drastic reductions in coal, oil and gas consumption necessary to avoid catastrophic warming of the planet. But to stave off the most disastrous damage, we need to swear off another product, too: hydrofluorocarbons, better known as HFCs. And banishing them shouldn’t be so hard, relatively speaking. In a bitter irony, these chemicals, used to cool, have also been driving global temperatures up. Used in refrigerators and air-conditioners since the 1980s, HFCs are extremely potent contributors to the earth’s warming. One HFC, 134a, used in most American refrigerators traps 1,300 times more heat than carbon dioxide does. Another, 410a, used in most American air-conditioners, is worse. Around the world, as more people rely on air-conditioning to cope with severe heat, the HFCs that routinely leak out of appliances and into the atmosphere have become the fastest-growing type of greenhouse gas emitted in every country on earth. There is a seemingly simple solution to this feedback loop: Stop making and using HFCs. But so far, we’ve been unable to do it — not for scientific reasons, but for political ones. Just as we do with fossil fuels, we already have alternatives to HFCs that don’t contribute to warming. For cooling, a range of substances including ammonia, propane and iso-butane can do the trick. Yet, instead of moving forward, our country has been reversing the steps it has already taken toward solving the HFC problem. This year, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would not be enforcing a 2015 rule that prohibited the use of HFCs. The E.P.A. has also proposed weakening an Obama-era effort to limit HFC leaks from appliances. An appeals court ruling written by none other than Brett Kavanaugh has further hampered the fight against these climate-polluting refrigerants. In 2017, Judge Kavanaugh ruled that the E.P.A.’s 2015 HFC rule exceeded the agency’s authority. Last week, on his first day as a justice, the Supreme Court decided it would not revisit that decision. (The E.P.A. has said that it is working on a new rule.) An international agreement known as the Kigali Amendment will begin phasing out HFCs in 2019. Though the United States, the biggest emitter of the chemicals, has yet to ratify the treaty, 53 parties, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico and the Maldives, an archipelago nation on the front lines of climate change, have already done so. With American participation, the agreement is expected to prevent half a degree Celsius of global warming by the end of the century. While Justice Kavanaugh, who has a history of striking down environmental regulations, may be on the highest court for life, Congress and the president who put him there have shorter terms. Resistance to ratifying Kigali has been led by a group that sees concern about the climate as “alarmism.” But after the midterms, their opposition may matter less. Already, there is plenty of support for the Kigali Amendment not just from environmental groups, but, critically, also from many Republicans and from the HFC manufacturers themselves. (Their interest seems to stem from having replacement refrigerants that would benefit from the phasing out of HFCs, but that is another story.) Unlike coal companies, the HFC industry actually wants the United States to phase out its product. Chemours, which spun off from DuPont in 2015 and inherited its chemical refrigerant business, has lobbied Congress to support the treaty and, along with Honeywell, another manufacturer of refrigerant chemicals, filed the appeal of the Kavanaugh ruling that the Supreme Court just decided not to hear. The Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, a coalition of manufacturers that make and use HFCs, wrote to President Trump in June to urge him to submit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate for ratification. Unwilling to wait for federal action, New York, California, Connecticut and Maryland have made their own plans for limiting the chemicals. There’s another reason to be optimistic that we will break from the environmentally catastrophic refrigerants: We’ve done it before. HFCs are actually themselves a replacement for CFCs, which were phased out by the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 treaty that was amended in Kigali in 2016 to also eliminate HFCs. First used as refrigerants in the 1930s, CFCs were on the market for more than four decades before scientists discovered they were eating away at the ozone in our atmosphere — a process that, had it been allowed to continue unchecked, would have eventually exposed us to lethal amounts of the sun’s radiation. The threat from HFCs is no less existential — or urgent. As the climate report makes clear, avoiding climate catastrophe will require almost superhuman efforts to overcome the wall of opposition to regulation erected by the fossil fuel industry. In comparison, breaking from HFCs should be comparatively easy. Sharon Lerner (@fastlerner) is an environmental reporter for The Intercept.

2018,"One Year After #MeToo, Examining a Collective Awakening","Gender Letter Gender Letter helps you keep up with the world, and the women shaping it. Tell me what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. One year ago today, The New York Times published a landmark investigation about how Harvey Weinstein had for decades paid off sexual harassment accusers. Culturally, the article hit like a meteor, drastically altering the landscape around how sexual misconduct is perceived, sending the #MeToo hashtag viral and, in turn, triggering an avalanche of accusations against powerful men. It wasn’t long before #MeToo wasn’t just a turn of phrase — it was a movement. That’s a lot for one year … and it felt like it. [Sign up here to get future installments of the Gender Letter delivered to your inbox.] “We’ve never seen something like this before,” said Joan Williams, a professor at Hastings College of the Law who studies gender dynamics at work. Some Americans expected a similar domino affect after Anita Hill testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991, but it didn’t happen, she went on. #MeToo has caused a “norms cascade,” or “a very abrupt change in social norms,” she said. In the months since, government organizations and advocacy groups like Rainn, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence group, have worked to meet the heightened demand spurred by #MeToo. The National Sexual Assault Hotline, operated by Rainn, has seen about a 30 percent increase in calls since the rise of #MeToo, and last Friday — the day after Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee — was the busiest day in the hotline’s 24-year history. This week, the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which is administered by the nonprofit National Women’s Law Center, reported that more than 3,500 people in all 50 states had reached out for legal help with sexual harassment at work. The fund, which has amassed $22 million in donations, was created in January to help working-class women — janitors, nurses, farm workers, those in service jobs — and defray legal costs associated with reporting harassment. So far, it has committed to funding 51 cases. And in June, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that investigates harassment claims, reported that it had seen its web traffic triple since #MeToo took hold. What will the next year bring? It’s hard to know. On Friday, Judge Kavanaugh cleared a crucial procedural vote in his quest for a Supreme Court seat, setting up a final vote as early as Saturday — despite allegations against him by multiple women and a late stand on Thursday by several thousand protesters. If there is one thing that is clear, though, it’s that a collective awakening has occurred, and that the endurance of the #MeToo movement will continue to be tested. • “Have we helped the survivors who risked everything?” News organizations have dedicated abundant resources to sexual misconduct accusations in the past year, but whether this effort has had a tangible effect depends on who you ask.

Ms. Starr had given the speech — to a group known as the Professional Women’s League — after interviewing six bachelors, including a lawyer, a newspaper writer and a merchant. She had asked each man the same question: Do men care for intelligent women? “I should not want my wife to try to solve the problems of the future,” the merchant said. “Men like the society of clever women, but they would rather marry fools,” said the lawyer.

2018,One of Italy’s Last ‘Story Singers’ Is Briefly Left Speechless,"The Saturday Profile MILITELLO, Sicily — For one of the few times in his life, Franco Trincale was speechless. The man who had spent some 60 years belting out song after song about the exploitation of workers, sundry social injustices and Italy’s political and criminal travails during decades of social upheaval could barely speak above a whisper. “I’ve lost my voice,” he croaked to the room full of well-wishers who had gathered in the town hall of Militello, his hometown in southeastern Sicily, to honor their compatriot who — like thousands of other Sicilians — had emigrated to northern Italy during the postwar boom and made good. Frankly, it was not a good day to be wordless. Mr. Trincale, 83, was in Militello for the opening this month of an exhibit dedicated to his long career as one of Sicily’s last old-school “cantastorie,” literally “story singers,” who recount an event in song, usually in rhyme. Many in the crowd were expecting one of his lively performances. But instead, Mr. Trincale attached his smartphone to an amplifier and chose a song, his strong tenor filling the hall. “I remember them as a child, the protectors of citizens, since always, not just yesterday, those marvelous carabinieri,” Mr. Trincale’s song went. The ballad told the story of a suicide attack on the Italian military police headquarters in Nasiriya, Iraq, in November 2003 that left 18 Italians and nine Iraqi civilians dead. The song ended: “I still ask myself why those carabinieri go to Iraq, in ruins, where they will be killed.” Missing from Mr. Trincale’s performance, which was nonetheless loudly applauded, were the tricks of his trade: a guitar and the large painted panel typically used by Sicilian cantastorie, which in comic book form would illustrate the tragic tale. The exhibit, sprawled throughout a wing of the town hall, contained a life’s worth of these panels, colorful codas to the cantastorie tradition. Painted by Mr. Trincale, but also by professional artists and his close friend Boris Dimitrov, some depicted more traditional tales, like the ballad of “Barunissa di Carini,” about a 16th-century Sicilian noblewoman assassinated for having committed adultery. An enigmatic 12-frame panel involving a blind soldier, two women, a baby, a murder and a prison told a sensational story that was well known to Sicilian audiences in the 1950s. But mostly, the panels captured Mr. Trincale’s often ironic take on recent Italian history, filtered through his left-leaning politics and big heart. There were accounts of mass migration from Italy’s poor south to the industrial north, and the labor unrest and occupied factories that followed; tales of the Mafia’s hold on his region; and a panoply of the political figures who had loomed large in recent history, from the seven-time prime minister Giulio Andreotti, who died in 2013, to the media mogul turned politician, Silvio Berlusconi, who was often the subject of Mr. Trincale’s barbs. Lawyers for Mr. Berlusconi, who has been indicted (and rarely convicted) on a number of charges, once claimed that their client could not get a fair trial in Milan because of Mr. Trincale’s caustic songs, which he belted from his regular post of many years, in front of Milan’s cathedral. Humans have been narrating through song from ancient times, and the cantastorie have a long history themselves. Over the centuries, they have moved from the aristocratic courts, where they glorified the rulers, to the piazzas, spinning tales over a handful of melodies, said Gian Paolo Borghi, an ethnographer and vice president of Italy’s national association of cantastorie. Depending who you talk to, Homer, Bertolt Brecht, Woody Guthrie and the Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo could qualify as cantastorie. Experts cite Mr. Trincale as an innovator in the traditional form. “Trincale has the merit of ferrying the cantastorie into the modern era,” said Claudio Piccoli, the editor of a periodical about the cantastorie. “He transformed the art.” Traditional cantastorie focused on folkloric themes and could spin their tales for hours, he said. By contrast, Mr. Trincale abridged his chronicles, tackling issues as varied as terrorism and the soccer star Maradona in three or four-minute songs. Mr. Trincale, born on Sept. 12, 1935, started singing as a boy, when he was an apprentice at a local barbershop, where he took up the guitar. “I learned to play four chords on the guitar, and they have remained those four chords,” he laughed, during an interview. But what he really wanted was to join the cantastorie. “When I was small, I used to sneak out of the barbershop and go listen to the cantastorie, my mouth agape,” he recalled. “They’d stand on a chair, to be more noticeable. They didn’t have a microphone, just a guitar, and all these people would be listening, and I’d say ‘That’s how I want to sing.’ ” “I guess I am a bit of an exhibitionist,” he added with a smile. Mr. Trincale moved to Milan in 1957, looking to better his fortunes. Those turned considerably when he began singing outside the factories in the Milanese hinterlands that were absorbing thousands of migrants from Italy’s southern regions. Mr. Trincale sang of their nostalgia for their hometowns, their aspirations and broken dreams, and their frustrations when they occupied factories and demanded better working conditions. At the inauguration of the exhibit, Mr. Trincale lovingly cradled a guitar given to him in 1968 by the workers of the Alfa Romeo factory in Arese. “I was the voice of the workers,” he said. Compared with other Sicilian cantastorie who sang in the local dialect, “Trincale was different because he sang in Italian, was biting in terms of his political commentary, but also ironic so that people were entertained,” said Remo Vigorelli, who coordinates an annual gathering of Italian cantastorie, mostly from central Italy, at a popular fair. For many years, he recorded with the record label Fonola, humorous 45-r.p.m. records — often pitting southern Italians against northerners — as well as sentimental ones that capture the heartbreak of Italy’s economic migrants (“Letter to a Faraway Father”). Mr. Trincale also self-published, moving from the traditional lyric sheets of the ballads that cantastorie sold in town squares, to music cassettes and CDs. In the early years, he listed his home phone number on his painted panels. Now he lists his website. People bought his songs, paying what they could, but Mr. Trincale said his career was never about money. With growing fame came travel: to the Soviet Union, where he participated in festivals celebrating the proletariat (he once belonged to the Italian Communist Party but later severed ties); and to the United States, where he participated in festivals that drew Italian emigrants. For around a decade, he was a fixture in the Piazza del Duomo in Milan, in front of the cathedral, where I first found him more than a decade ago. In 2010, the city awarded him the “Ambrogino d’Oro,” the city’s highest accolade. Mr. Trincale has slowed in recent years, though not necessarily of his own will. Milan recently changed its regulations regarding street artists, and Mr. Trincale found himself sidelined from the Piazza del Duomo by a series of bureaucratic obstacles. Also, his wife, Lina, whom he fell for when he was 17 and she was 13, has been ill for the past three years. They have been married for 61 years, and he cannot bear to be separated from her. He wrote a love poem to his wife on the flight to Sicily from Milan, and sent it to his daughter to read to her. “My daughter is happy because she knows she was born of a deep love,” he said. In 2006, the Sicilian province of Catania bought Mr. Trincale’s archive of song lyrics, panels, posters, trophies, awards and sundry documents. But a promised museum never materialized (“My stuff hibernated in Catania,” Mr. Trincale grumbled). This year, Militello’s mayor, Giovanni Burtone, obtained a five-year loan of the collection, and he hopes to make it into another tourist attraction for Militello, already one of several towns in the Val di Noto, an area of Sicily on Unesco’s World Heritage List. “When he last played in Militello last year, Franco played some new ballads,” Mr. Burtone said. “He’s never stopped working.”",The New York Times
2018,Open-Wheel Racing Series for Women Will Start in 2019,"LONDON — A new international motorsport series for women will begin next year, with the goal of finding the first female Formula One champion. Motorsports remain heavily dominated by men, not only behind the wheel but also in the pit lane, garage, workshop and laboratory. While women have had modest success in the top levels of Nascar and IndyCar racing in the past two decades, a female driver has not started a Formula One race since Lella Lombardi in 1976. The new W Series will be free to enter and aims not only to promote female drivers but also to steer girls and women into engineering and science careers. The series is the brainchild of Catherine Bond Muir, a British sports lawyer and corporate financier. She conceived the idea while on maternity leave three years ago. “Many sports in which women and men compete equally also run segregated events purely to increase the numbers of women who participate,” she said in a news release. “Until now, motor racing has been the only sport in which there were no separate series for women.” She added: “There has never been a female Formula One race winner, let alone a world champion. Our mission is to change all of that.” W Series will begin next May and feature six 30-minute races on some of the most famous circuits in Europe, most of which have staged Formula One grands prix for many decades. In coming seasons, the series will include races in North America, Asia and Australia. The cars will be the Tatuus model used in Formula 3, a steppingstone series to F1. There is a total prize fund of $1.5 million, with the overall winner collecting $500,000. There will be prize money awarded down to 18th place in the final standings. The anticipated field of 20 drivers will be chosen during a process involving on-track testing, simulator appraisal, technical engineering tests, fitness trials and media training. “There are just too few women competing in single-seaters series at the moment,” Bond Muir said. “W Series will increase that number very significantly in 2019.” The series has the support of many motorsport figures. Two of its advisory board members are David Coulthard, a winner of 13 grands prix during a 15-year career in Formula One, and Adrian Newey, the most successful design engineer in British motorsport history, contributing to 20 Formula One drivers’ and constructors’ world championships with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull Racing. “In order to be a successful racing driver, you have to be skilled, determined, competitive, brave and physically fit, but you don’t have to possess the kind of super-powerful strength levels that some sports require,” Coulthard said in a news release. “You also don’t have to be a man.” He said female drivers tended to reach a “glass ceiling” at the Formula 3 level on their learning curve, often as a result of a lack of funding rather than a lack of talent. Stéphane Kox, 24, a female driver currently competing in the GT4 European Series, sees the W Series as an invaluable steppingstone. “W Series sounds like it’s going to be a really positive addition to the global motorsport scene, and it’ll clearly be a big help to ambitious female racing drivers everywhere,” she said. “Having spoken to the W Series organization, it’s clear they understand that we women drivers aspire to race. Speaking for myself, I want to be a racing driver at the highest level possible and to be able to race against the best drivers, men and women. “In order to be able to do so, it’s important that first we gain the kind of experience the series will provide.” Courtney Crone, a 17-year-old American who won a championship in the Formula Car Challenge Series this year, said: “To be a success in racing you need natural ability, but you also need the opportunity to learn. W Series will give young female drivers that opportunity.” Kevin Magnussen, 26, a Danish driver for Haas in Formula One, said he would be watching the W Series closely. “When I was karting as a boy, I raced a few girls who were talented and quick,” he said. “But there weren’t many of them — a lot more boys than girls go-karting and that’s a fact — so I welcome W Series and I hope it’ll help female racers progress their careers.”",The New York Times

I’m back in the office after spending time in Paris for the opening of the Opéra’s 350th-anniversary season. What a joy to have Meyerbeer’s “Les Huguenots” brought back by the company that birthed it, for the first time since 1936. (And in a coolly stylish, excellently sung production, no less.) I met with Stéphane Lissner, the Opéra’s general director, who will depart because of French age limits in 2021. He said he wouldn’t be putting any names of possible successors forward, but rumors abound. Also in opera news, Rufus Wainwright’s new opera, “Hadrian,” opens next weekend in Toronto. I don’t think I was alone in finding his first one, “Prima Donna,” slow going. But he’s learned some things from that process, which he calls “a nightmare.” Turning to the violin: Joshua Barone spent some time at home in Massachusetts with Hilary Hahn, who, 21 years after her debut recording, is returning to Bach for the rest of his solo works. And congratulations to Leila Josefowicz, who’s won the $100,000 Avery Fisher Prize. ZACHARY WOOLFE For any faults it may have, it’s impossible to not be moved by “The Mile-Long Opera,” a sleek and poignant project by the architect Liz Diller and the composer David Lang, with text by Anne Carson and Claudia Rankine. The work unfolds along the length of the High Line, with a clever score that urges you forward with lures, in the form of chord resolution always just a little bit farther down the path. Stories — dealing, obliquely, with themes of urban development and everything that accompanies it, good and bad — are sung and spoken by 1,000 performers plucked from professional and amateur choirs from around New York. “Rent’s gone crazy,” they sing amid the condos that create a valley of luxury on either side of the elevated park, but there are also lighter moments. And serendipitous ones, like when they sang “I love the way after rain the smell of wet cement will stay in the streets all day,” shortly after it happened to rain on Thursday evening, or when a woman fussily said “Just so noisy” as a helicopter took off just a couple of hundred feet away on the Hudson River. The opera has the feel of an elegy, one that people can easily relate to if they’ve lived in New York and experienced how rapidly, and sometimes cruelly, it can change. Remaining performances are sold out, but a 360-degree video version created by Target is available at milelongopera.com. JOSHUA BARONE The hangar-size Drill Hall of the Park Avenue Armory is probably no one’s idea of the perfect space for Bach. But it has become home to some of New York’s most memorable Bach performances of recent years: the large-scale “St. Matthew’s Passion,” performed by the Berlin Philharmonic in a searing staging by Peter Sellars, and also the deeply intimate “Goldberg” Variations played by the pianist Igor Levit in a collaboration with the artist Marina Abramovic. Now comes “The Six Brandenburg Concertos,” a striking setting by the choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, played by the Baroque ensemble B’Rock (through Sunday). Each of these Bach spectaculars may have had elements that could dismay purists, but each turned a masterpiece into a generally thrilling event, thanks to smart programming and collaborations with top-notch artists. And events are all too rare for a composer who wrote no operas, and whom symphony orchestras have been shy about playing since the rise of period specialists. MICHAEL COOPER Any time a new work by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker arrives in New York, it’s as much a musical event as a dance one. That was especially the case with “The Six Brandenburg Concertos.” Her pieces, like “Partita 2” (also to Bach) and “Vortex Temporum” (to Grisey), tend to explore the relationship between music and movement, often to revelatory effect. With her latest dance, she has shed new light on the “Brandenburgs”; this is a reading of the revolutionary concertos as joyous, youthful and borderline improvisatory. No need to look at this music, her choreography says, as some stuffy museum piece. JOSHUA BARONE High-profile cancellations are far from unusual in the opera world. But when a bout of bronchitis forced Maria Callas to cut short a 1958 performance of “Norma,” the press upbraided her as an ungrateful and unreliable diva. “My lynching had begun,” she later said. Such misunderstandings play a central role in director Tom Volf’s new film, “Maria by Callas,” which had its New York premiere at the Film Society of Lincoln Center’s New Film Festival on Sunday. Delivering a wealth of rare footage of the great soprano, a lot of it personal and filmed at home with her poodles, the documentary probes Callas’ fame: the popular myths that both cemented her “La Divina” status in the late 1950s and ’60s and erased her as a private person offstage. While Mr. Volf falls just short of hagiography at times and ultimately succumbs to other equally mythological narratives about her later life — the notion that her demise was hastened by a jilted heart, for one — there’s enough fresh stuff here that the documentary deserves plaudits for its archival meticulousness. Those used to less-than-vivid stock of her concert performance of “Casta diva” in Paris or her Covent Garden “Habanera,” for instance, are in for a colorful treat. And if the interviews with David Frost and a baby Barbara Walters aren’t enough to capture her essence, the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, a diva in her own right, is on hand to read from private letters. JOEL ROZEN Puccini’s “La Bohème” may be the world’s most familiar opera. But the cast currently appearing in the Metropolitan Opera’s revival of Franco Zeffirelli’s production brings wonderful freshness, spontaneity and warmth to their performances. Each singer in the six main roles is outstanding, especially the exciting tenor Vittorio Grigolo as Rodolfo, the appealing soprano Nicole Car as Mimì, and the charismatic Angel Blue as Musetta. Best of all, they worked together like a true ensemble of equals. For this, the American conductor James Gaffigan, making his Met debut at 39, deserves credit. He is best known as a dynamic conductor of 20th-century repertory, like the Prokofiev symphonies. (Here he is expounding on Prokofiev’s Fifth in conjunction with a performance in Toronto.) Earlier this year he conducted Bernstein’s “Serenade” for Violin and Orchestra with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, a gripping account. And I was very impressed in 2015 when led the New York Philharmonic in a crackling premiere performance of Andrew Norman’s breathless “Split” for piano and orchestra. He has also appeared at major opera houses and that experience came through in “Bohème.” While giving his impassioned singers expressive leeway, he maintained cohesion and momentum in Puccini’s episodic score. The Met and the Philharmonic should keep him in their rosters. ANTHONY TOMMASINI",The New York Times
2018,"Operators in Fatal Duck Boat Accident Say They Owe Families Nothing, Citing Obscure 1851 Law","Two companies that operated the Missouri tourist boat that sank during a storm in July, killing 17 people, have invoked a 19th century federal maritime law to claim that they owe no money to the victims’ family members who have filed multiple lawsuits. The operators, Ripley Entertainment and Branson Duck Vehicles, filed a lawsuit in federal court on Monday, seeking to take advantage of an 1851 law that could limit their financial liability to the duck boat’s value after the crash and any cargo that was on board. The vessel, which sank to the bottom of Table Rock Lake in Branson, Mo., is now worthless and had no freight, so the companies owe $0, their lawyers argued. While shipowners routinely seek such protections in accidents and the families’ lawyers anticipated the legal maneuver, the filing by the companies angered survivors and the victims’ family members. Tia Coleman, who escaped the sinking boat but who lost nine relatives, including her husband and three children, said that she was insulted and called for a boycott of Ripley Entertainment, which operates numerous tourist attractions, including Ripley’s Believe It or Not. “Ripley’s legal claim that my husband and children are worthless is incredibly hurtful and insensitive,” Ms. Coleman, who has filed lawsuits seeking $100 million in damages, said in a statement. A lawyer representing her, Robert J. Mongeluzzi, said he would file a response in court arguing that the maritime law does not apply in this case. It has been cited after high-profile accidents throughout American history, including in lawsuits involving the sinking of the Titanic and the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. “They are saying that the lives that they killed are worthless,” Mr. Mongeluzzi said in an interview on Thursday. “As you might imagine, it has been incredibly hurtful to the families who lost loved ones.” The companies’ petition, filed in the United States District Court of Western Missouri, seeks to limit what they could owe and to combine all of the lawsuits in the accident into one federal court case. A spokeswoman for Ripley called the legal request “common in claims related to maritime incidents.” “While this filing may limit the company’s liability, we are filing this request at the same time we are actively pursuing mediation and settlement with those most affected, and have already scheduled, or are in the process of scheduling, mediations,” the spokeswoman, Suzanne Smagala-Potts, said in an email. More than two dozen lawsuits, filed in both federal and state court, have been brought against Ripley, which owns the Ride the Ducks operation on Table Rock Lake, or Branson Duck Vehicles, which owned the boat that sank. The boat capsized on July 19 while it tried to navigate choppy water and rain as a thunderstorm moved through southwestern Missouri. Of the 31 people on board, 17 died. The law at the center of the case, the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851, has been criticized for years over claims that it has been misapplied and used in ways that Congress did not envision when it was passed. The law was enacted to protect American shipowners competing with foreign vessels at a time in the mid-19th century when modern insurance did not exist and other countries had similar laws and booming trade. The law includes provisions that could undercut the duck boat operators’ claims that they are not financially liable, said Robert Force, a professor of maritime law at Tulane University. Companies must prove they had no prior knowledge of negligence or unseaworthy conditions that could have contributed to the accident. Both companies made such a claim in court, but they may not hold up, Mr. Force said. “Even though management may not have been involved in the individual decision, if management didn’t have rules and regulations for their employees with respect to not taking the boat out under certain conditions, that would be enough to rule it out,” Mr. Force said in an interview on Thursday. Another lawyer for Ms. Coleman, Jeffrey P. Goodman, said he would focus his legal response on another requirement of the 1851 law: It applies only in accidents on “navigable waters.” The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in 1983 that Table Rock Lake was “not navigable” because it was “used exclusively for recreational activities.” That case was brought by a man injured in a boating accident on the lake. The Eighth Circuit’s characterization of the lake has been criticized in recent years as outdated because of the commercial activity that takes place on it, which includes tourist boat rides. Nonetheless, Mr. Goodman said the court’s ruling hurts the companies’ ability to invoke the 1851 law. “Table Rock Lake is not navigable,” Mr. Goodman said. “They are going to have to overcome that.” In spite of the court filing, Ms. Smagala-Potts said, Ripley has offered to mediate the victims’ claims in an effort to avoid lengthy litigation. Mr. Mongeluzzi said that Ripley had offered to enter mediation but had not detailed any potential settlements. “Our plaintiffs are analyzing how we will respond to that,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"Order a Coffee and Pay, With a Tap on the Dash","Wheels The car of the future will have powerful communication technology on board. As self-driving cars pull onto the nation’s roads, these advanced abilities will help manage the traffic mix of tomorrow, but they may also change the way we communicate while on the go. Automakers are betting that if our cars have the technological muscle to keep us connected, we will park our phones when we get in and communicate from the dashboard. A side benefit of all this technology is that it will also usher in a range of conveniences. These may include offering drivers options for fuel, food and lodging, perhaps with a bit of a hard sell thrown in. For owners of some General Motors vehicles, a taste of this future is already here. Since December, G.M. has equipped about three million cars with an in-dash system it calls Marketplace. The free-to-use system communicates directly with merchants, enabling a driver or passengers to order and pay for a variety of products and services without a cellphone. Vendors include McDonald’s, Shell, Exxon Mobil, Dunkin’ Donuts, Applebee’s, Delivery.com, IHOP, Parkopedia, Priceline, Wingstop, TGI Fridays, Office Depot and Yelp (for restaurant reservations). Many owners of cars equipped with Marketplace probably don’t even know it’s available. Only about 75,000 people have signed on, and it’s not mentioned in any car manuals. G.M. wanted to allow time for refinement and for lining up more merchants, but is now starting to promote the system to consumers. Marketplace interacts with G.M.’s infotainment system and establishes a dialogue with the car owner. For example, if the car is running low on fuel, Marketplace can provide directions to the nearest gas station. The system allows drivers to sign up for the vendor’s reward program and can point the way to discounted gas. There is no need to swipe a credit card at the pump, because Marketplace handles the transaction and turns on the pump. Marketplace communicates by means of a 4GLT modem that can connect to a cellular network or Wi-Fi. G.M. was well situated to adopt this technology, because its vehicles have been equipped with modems since OnStar’s debut in 1996. Other carmakers have introduced modem-based communication systems, but G.M. has made the most comprehensive push into mobile communication and marketing. Rick Ruskin, a General Motors executive leading the connected customer experience, also points out a focus on limiting distracted driving. “Marketplace allows drivers to do in their car what they might previously have done on their phone,” he said. “It’s much safer than a phone in one hand and the steering wheel in the other.” Automakers have long employed the driver’s cellphone and a Bluetooth connection as the underlying technology for convenience features, but more companies and analysts view this as an inelegant and limited solution. A built-in modem with its own SIM card will eventually become the only way new cars communicate with one another, the infrastructure, the owner’s devices and mobile vendors, said David Liniado, vice president for new growth and technology at the Cox Automotive research firm. SIM cards, which carry an identification number unique to the owner, are now in 130 million vehicles globally, Mr. Liniado said. “Bluetooth and the phone are gone,” he added. The driver or front-seat passenger can interact with Marketplace by touching the dashboard screen. Voice command technology is in development, Stefan Cross, a G.M. spokesman, said. Actions that require considerable involvement and could distract a driver, such as booking a hotel room on Priceline, can be executed only when the vehicle is stopped. Marketplace also limits options. For example, a Starbucks customer can order from the car while it is being driven, but only a few choices, based on previous orders, will be displayed. And the format is standardized so drivers know where to look and what to do no matter which vendor’s page they open, helping them remain focused on the road. Marketplace vendors either pay an upfront fee to be included or give G.M. a share of sales. It’s not a huge revenue stream, but it’s better than no revenue. On a web page aimed at merchants that hope to sell directly to drivers, the automaker writes: “Marketplace is the spark to ignite a shift in how consumers are immersed into vehicle experiences. With a first-of-its-kind branded ecosystem, Marketplace enables businesses to seamlessly integrate into drivers’ daily lives.” Other automakers are taking advantage of in-car communication on a smaller scale. BMW Connected now allows vehicle owners to speak to Alexa from the car, using the car’s onboard modem, no smartphone required. The automaker has not added vendors to its system, but car owners can ask Alexa to place orders. Land Rover’s Touch Pro Duo system communicates via an in-car modem and can find filling stations and provide traffic information. Mercedes-Benz offers a system called Mercedes Me. An app that provides control functions is installed on a cellphone or other personal device, and the car communicates with the owner via the vehicle’s onboard modem. The system enables the creation of “geofence” boundaries. If the automobile is driven beyond a boundary, it sends a message to the car owner. Audi has added a feature called Traffic Light Information, which “talks” to stoplights and can tell drivers how long they will have to wait before the light changes to green. It works only in the few cities, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and Washington, that have installed the necessary hardware. While automakers and industry consultants are thinking about how in-car communication will work, others, like Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are thinking about ways to ensure that these features won’t introduce new hazards. “In providing information to the driver, we have to thread it strategically. Drivers must have ample time to look at the road,” Dr. Reimer said. “They can’t look off the road even briefly if they haven’t looked at the road long enough to see what’s going on.” Dr. Reimer said engineers were devising systems that can determine how often and how long the driver is looking at the road, and issue alerts and warnings if the driver’s attention wanders. Asked if there were any regulations on what a driver should be doing in the vehicle, Dr. Reimer said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration “has developed distraction guidelines regarding vehicle activities in general, but they don’t specify what type of in-vehicle applications should be allowed.” He added: “The Automotive Alliance has also provided guidelines that manufacturers have pledged to follow with regard to driver distraction. One has to ask, is it really appropriate to shop in a car? As vehicles automate more, it is plausible that what is acceptable should change, but we haven’t really come to grips with what is appropriate to do on either a smartphone or using an in-car application while driving.” All things considered, it seems certain that new car buyers will soon be in touch with almost everything while on the fly, and that this ability will undoubtedly expand. By default, the car will be part of the internet of things. For those driving older vehicles, some retrofitting will be possible. Verizon offers a modem device and feature set, called Hum, that is similar to what is built into new cars and plugs into the onboard-diagnostics port of most vehicles from 1996 and later, and Mercedes-Benz dealers in Britain are retrofitting communication ability in many cars built since 2002.",The New York Times
2018,"Original Big Bird, Caroll Spinney, Leaves ‘Sesame Street’ After Nearly 50 Years","Mr. Spinney’s remarkable run as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, two of the most beloved characters on television, will end this week. Caroll Spinney, who has been with “Sesame Street” since it began in 1969, is retiring from the show.CreditCreditCody O'Loughlin for The New York Times WOODSTOCK, Conn. — The friendly, bearded face of Caroll Spinney may not be one you recognize immediately. But if you have watched TV at any point in the past 50 years or so, you are almost certainly familiar with his work. Since 1969, he has played the parts of the gentle, inquisitive Big Bird and the lovably disgruntled Oscar the Grouch on “Sesame Street,” the long-running children’s program. This Thursday, as he so often has, Spinney, 84, plans to travel to the studios in Astoria, Queens, where “Sesame Street” is produced, and record some voices for his colorful alter egos. Then he will retire from the program: His roles will be passed on to new performers and his remarkable half-century run, in which he has embodied two of the most beloved characters on television, will come to an end. Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit education organization that produces “Sesame Street,” did not have a precise figure for the number of episodes Spinney has appeared in, but a spokeswoman said the number was likely thousands of the more than 4,400 episodes that have been created. Spinney, who spoke last week from his living room here, seated next to his wife, Debra, said that he had few if any regrets about his time on “Sesame Street.” “I always thought, How fortunate for me that I got to play the two best Muppets?” he said. “Playing Big Bird is one of the most joyous things of my life.” [See where to stream a great documentary about Big Bird] Asked if he had long been contemplating his departure from “Sesame Street,” where he has worked since its debut, Spinney answered, “No, not at all.” But in recent years, Spinney said, the physical requirements of performing the characters had become difficult for him, and he had developed problems with his balance. He stopped doing the puppeteering for Big Bird in 2015 and has since been providing only the voices for him and Oscar. The impending 50th anniversary of “Sesame Street,” for which his final voice recordings will be used when it is celebrated on the show — the episodes will run next year on HBO and in 2020 on PBS — seemed like a good moment to take a bow. Debra Spinney said, “It’s just the fates that bring things to a head sometimes.” Throughout their Bavarian-style chalet house are countless mementos that Spinney has collected from a lifetime of playing an 8-foot-2 avian and a monster who lives in a garbage can. There’s the rocking chair with Big Bird’s gargantuan, disembodied orange and pink legs attached at either side; the congratulatory letter Spinney received on his 75th birthday from then-President-elect Barack Obama; the wall of photographs in which Spinney has posed with other TV luminaries like Sid Caesar, Bob Hope and Jerry Seinfeld. Several pictures show him working alongside Jim Henson, the iconoclastic creator of the Muppets, who recruited Spinney to “Sesame Street” all those years ago. Although they had previously crossed paths in the 1960s, Spinney pinpointed a fateful encounter at a Salt Lake City puppeteers’ festival in 1969, when Henson watched him try to perform a multimedia show that went gradually awry. As Spinney recalled, Henson came to him afterward to say, “I liked what you were trying to do.” Soon after, Henson invited Spinney to play two Muppet characters that were being developed for “Sesame Street,” which made its debut on public television later that year. One was Oscar, who was envisioned as a cranky, trash-loving purple character. (He was orange in his earliest appearances, before taking on his familiar green hue.) The other was Big Bird, who was performed in a full body costume and who, Spinney said, he was originally asked to play as “a funny, dumb country yokel.” After a few episodes, Spinney made a suggestion to the show’s producers. “I said, I think I should play him like he’s a child, a surrogate,” he recalled. “He can be all the things that children are. He can learn with the kids.” That had a lasting effect on Big Bird and on “Sesame Street,” where the character came to embody the tender, nurturing soul of the show. “Big Bird has always had the biggest heart on ‘Sesame Street,’ and that’s Caroll’s gift to us,” said Jeffrey Dunn, the president and chief executive of Sesame Workshop. “I think it’s fair to say that Caroll’s view of the world and how we should treat each other has shaped and defined our organization.” The character became an instantly recognizable symbol of youthful guilelessness, traveling the world and appearing on other TV shows like “Saturday Night Live,” “The West Wing” and “The Colbert Report.” Big Bird was the protagonist of the 1985 “Sesame Street” feature film, “Follow That Bird,” and Spinney was the subject of a 2014 documentary, “I Am Big Bird.” Spinney has said that over the years his work on “Sesame Street” acquainted him with countless fans who could not help but tell him — often with eyes full of tears — how the show had changed their lives. [ What did you love about Big Bird or Oscar the Grouch? What lessons did they teach you and your family? Please share your reflections in the comments. We may publish a selection. ] He spoke of a woman he met in Cambridge, Mass., who related how a chance encounter with Oscar the Grouch in her adolescence taught her it was permissible to stand up for herself. While wandering through the TV channels, Spinney said, the woman came upon “this strange creature saying no.” As she later told him, “I didn’t know you could say no to an adult.” “Sesame Street” was also responsible for introducing Spinney to Debra, who was working in the community education department of what was then called Children’s Television Workshop when they first met, in 1972. “I couldn’t believe Big Bird was coming up and talking to me,” she said of their earliest interactions. Though Oscar and Big Bird seem to have little in common, Spinney observed that they were both solitary characters who performed with other humans but few other Muppets. That suited him, he said. “I’m a soloist,” said Spinney. “I’m not good with a team. I’m out of sync with the rest. They’re all going left at the same time, while I’m the only one going right.” More forlornly, he said that it was “very lonely in there” playing Big Bird. “I was separated from everybody.” Matt Vogel, who has been Spinney’s apprentice on Big Bird since 1996, will succeed him in the role. Vogel, who has also inherited the parts of other popular Muppets, including Kermit the Frog and Count von Count, said he saw the task of carrying on Spinney’s legacy as “daunting and important.” “The more I do the character, the more that I try to preserve what I think Caroll’s intentions were,” he said. “Inevitably, part of our own personality starts to creep into those characters. But that’s the way they live on.” At his departure, Spinney will be one of the last surviving “Sesame Street” staff members who has been with the show since its very beginning. In some form or another, he plans to remain an ambassador of “Sesame Street,” at conventions and other public appearances. “I’ll be 100 years old, doing Muppet stuff,” he said. He recalled how he and Henson used to imagine themselves “being old” — by which they meant, in their 70s — “doing Muppets the rest of our lives.” Henson, who died in 1990 at age 53, “didn’t get that chance, but I will be,” Spinney said. Big Bird shows up frequently in the artwork that Spinney creates and surrounds himself with at home. That collection includes paintings like the one he calls “Going Home,” in which Big Bird is seen approaching an enormous tree, its many branches colonized by countless birdhouses. Another Spinney painting, titled “In My Dreams I Can Fly,” shows Big Bird — who is traditionally depicted as flightless — with his wings spread as he soars high above the countryside. Repeating a phrase he has often used to describe his relationship to the compassionate Big Bird over the years, Spinney said, “I don’t get to play him — I get to live his life.” Though the role would no longer be his, he was hanging onto a portion of the playful spirit that came with it. “I’ve been playing a 6-year-old for 50 years,” Spinney said. With a bit of mischievous glee, he added: “And the children bought it.”",The New York Times
2018,"Orioles, After 115 Losses, Part Ways With Showalter and Duquette","BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Orioles will continue their rebuilding project without Manager Buck Showalter and the executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette, who were fired Wednesday after the team finished with the worst record in the major leagues. With Duquette procuring the talent and Showalter making it work on the field, Baltimore snapped a run of 14 straight losing seasons and made the playoffs in 2012, 2014 and 2016. But the Orioles finished 75-87 in 2017 — losing 19 of their final 23 games — and this year staggered through a 47-115 season, the worst since the team moved to Baltimore in 1954. The club issued a statement Wednesday night that read, in part: “We thank Dan and Buck for their many contributions over the past several years. Under their leadership, prior to the 2018 season and for six consecutive years, the club delivered competitive teams playing meaningful baseball into September.” Showalter and Duquette have contracts that expire at the end of October. A three-time A.L. Manager of the Year, Showalter ranks second on the Orioles’ career list with 669 victories, trailing Earl Weaver. He took over in August 2010 and orchestrated the resurgence of a floundering franchise. Once hailed for making baseball in Baltimore relevant again, Showalter, 62, is out of a job after a season in which the Orioles finished 61 games behind Boston in the A.L. East. Before opening day, Duquette signed the free-agent pitchers Alex Cobb and Andrew Cashner. He also spurned trade offers for the pending free agent Manny Machado with hopes that the Oriolescould be a contender in 2018. It never happened. Baltimore went 8-20 in April and owned a 19-50 record on June 16. Just over a month later, before the July 31 nonwaiver trade deadline, Duquette tore apart the roster by swapping Machado, Zach Britton, Jonathan Schoop and several other veterans for 15 minor league prospects and international signing bonus slot money. He won’t be around to see this rebuild to the finish. Brian Graham, the director of player development, will handle day-to-day oversight of baseball operations while the Orioles search for Duquette’s successor. Showalter earned A.L. Manager of the Year honors in 2014 after taking the Orioles to the division title and a berth in the Championship Series. He was also chosen Manager of Year with the Yankees in 1994 and Texas in 2004. His career record is 1,551-1,517, including 669-684 with Baltimore. “I just think ever since he came here, the franchise just gained a little more accountability, gained an edge for some time,” Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said before the final game of the season. “It’s the end of an era. A great manager, a great tenure. I don’t know if he’s going to coach or manage again, but he’s got grandchildren. Go golf. Relax and go sit on the golf course.” Duquette joined the Orioles in November 2011. Baltimore reached the postseason in 2012, the first of five successive seasons in which Baltimore finished at least .500. Duquette’s tenure in Baltimore featured the crafty signing of the free agents Nelson Cruz and Mark Trumbo, both of whom led the majors in home runs with the Orioles. But Duquette also signed the right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez, who went 32-42 over the length of a four-year, $50 million contract, and Baltimore is still paying the price for the seven-year, $161 million deal offered to slugger Chris Davis before the 2016 season. Davis batted .168 this season, the lowest batting average by a qualifier in major league history, and he struck out 192 times over 128 games. Duquette, 60, replaced Andy MacPhail as Baltimore’s overseer of baseball operations. Before that, Duquette enjoyed successful tenures with the Boston Red Sox from 1994 to 2001 and the Montreal Expos from 1987 to 93. The Red Sox reached the playoffs three times under his guidance. The Orioles say they will hire an executive from outside of the organization to lead the baseball operations department. That person will be in charge of choosing a new manager.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Orson Welles and the Birth of Fake News,"Many people believed his famous “War of the Worlds” broadcast — but many didn’t. The difference offers a valuable lesson today. Mr. Schwartz is a doctoral student in history at Princeton and the author of “Broadcast Hysteria: Orson Welles’s War of the Worlds and the Art of Fake News.” Eighty years ago on Tuesday, Orson Welles revealed the terrifying power of fake news. On Oct. 30, 1938, Welles directed a radio adaptation of “The War of the Worlds,” reimagining its Martian invasion through fictitious news flashes. Many contemporary newspapers claimed the show sparked a mass panic, sending multitudes of listeners fleeing their homes in fear. But that stubbornly persistent narrative is false. The myth of the “War of the Worlds” panic not only misinterprets how media persuasion and fake news actually work — it prevents us from understanding how to grapple with the problem today. Over the past decade, a scholarly consensus has formed that the press grossly exaggerated the effects of Welles’s broadcast. Only a small fraction of radio listeners mistook it for real news, and precious few did anything that could be described as “panicking.” The better question, then, is why “The War of the Worlds” frightened some people but not others. In 1938, the answer seemed clear. Many scholars believed radio could, like a hypodermic needle, inject ideas straight into people’s minds, convincing them of anything — even something as fantastical as an alien attack. But further investigation refuted this simplistic picture. A Princeton University survey of frightened listeners indicated only about a third understood the invaders to be Martians. The rest imagined something more plausible that they already feared, such as a Nazi blitzkrieg. The broadcast, in short, didn’t bypass the conscious intellect to convince people of something they wouldn’t otherwise believe. It passed through pre-existing fears, attitudes and beliefs, to be corroborated or refuted within the mind of each listener. The most extreme examples of panic often came from people told to tune in by someone else. They responded not so much to the radio’s power as to the trust they placed in their particular messenger. Some never even heard the show itself. Later studies of the mass media would confirm these two fundamental rules of persuasion. Media messages generally cannot convince audiences of something contrary to their existing attitudes or prejudices. But they can powerfully reinforce what people already believe. Second, especially in the age of social media, fake news is most powerful when it is shared — not just by prominent information sources but also by anyone on Twitter or Facebook. The social media campaign carried out by Russian intelligence in 2016 to help elect President Trump depended on the very same persuasive factors that Welles unwittingly revealed. Russian operatives developed propaganda that, like “The War of the Worlds,” appealed to pre-existing fear and anger among the American public, activating voters inclined to vote Republican and giving Democrats reasons to stay home. This content was specifically designed to be shared, so that voters might encounter it through someone they trusted. Crucially, unlike bygone broadcasters, Russian intelligence operatives could target their messages to specific portions of the electorate residing in key swing states, with propaganda tailor-made for small, specialized audiences already primed for persuasion. Still, the basic means of fighting fake news haven’t changed much in 80 years. Many listeners frightened by “The War of the Worlds” tried to verify what they heard, either by changing stations or calling local authorities. Such reflexive skepticism can and must be taught. The fundamentals of media literacy should occupy a central place in middle school and high school curriculums, arming students with the critical mind-set today’s media landscape demands. But this problem cannot be solved solely on the individual level. As digital tools for falsifying images and video become ever more sophisticated and accessible, our democracy increasingly hinges on a question many Americans first considered in the wake of “The War of the Worlds.” As one Mississippian asked after the broadcast, in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, “How will we know when news is news, or when it is just fiction, if that is an example of future radio programs?” That listener and others called upon their government to directly censor the radio. The Communications Act of 1934 required that broadcasters operate in “the public interest, convenience, or necessity.” The F.C.C., charged with implementing the law, took no official action. It didn’t need to. Just the threat of regulation was enough to persuade the major broadcast networks to censor themselves. Fearful of losing revenue by offending listeners, networks banned the use of news broadcast language in drama, reserving the trappings of journalism for actual reportage. Today, social networks like Twitter and Facebook occupy the position once held by those broadcasters, serving as trusted conduits for news and information. That position must again come with a responsibility to serve the public interest by actively protecting users from misinformation. Without impeding the flow of ideas, internet providers can and should place reasonable limits on how some ideas are expressed, both by strengthening efforts to block websites that mimic legitimate news sources and by shuttering accounts that spread counterfeit journalism — whether they represent individuals, automated “bots” or government entities. If such action is not made a priority, voters must elect officials who will apply the same kind of pressure the F.C.C. did 80 years ago. Otherwise, we will all soon know what it felt like to be trapped in the scattered pockets of hysteria created by “The War of the Worlds” — surrounded by fear and misinformation, unable or unwilling to seek the truth.

2018,"Orsted, a Giant in Offshore Wind Farms, Makes a Move in the U.S.","Orsted, a Danish company that is one of the world’s largest offshore wind energy developers, said on Monday that it would acquire a Rhode Island rival, Deepwater Wind, for $510 million, a sign that the United States is becoming an attractive market for offshore energy generators. Orsted has a global portfolio of projects in places including Britain, Germany and Taiwan, as well as in Denmark. But this year, it failed to win a competitive bidding process held by Massachusetts to develop what is likely to be the largest offshore wind installation in the United States. The acquisition of Deepwater Wind appears to be an attempt by Orsted to better navigate the regulatory and political systems of the United States. In a statement, Martin Neubert, Orsted’s chief executive for offshore wind, cited “Deepwater Wind’s longstanding expertise in originating, developing and permitting offshore wind projects in the U.S.” Deepwater Wind, which is based in Providence, R.I., and owned by D. E. Shaw, a hedge fund, does seem to have a knack for lining up deals. It built the first offshore wind farm in the United States, a five-turbine installation off Block Island, in its home state, that came online in 2016. The company has several other projects underway, including one that is expected to generate large amounts of electricity for Rhode Island and Connecticut from a tract off Martha’s Vineyard. In an interview, Mr. Neubert suggested that Orsted needed to make a move after failing to win both the Massachusetts contract and one for a project off the Connecticut coast. It was clear, Mr. Neubert said, that the offshore market in the United States would grow rapidly in the coming years, and that Orsted wanted to be well positioned to compete for deals. “For us, the U.S. offshore wind market is a very attractive, strategically important market,” he said. Deepwater Wind’s chief executive, Jeffrey Grybowski, said his company had been seeking investors or partners to give it the scale and expertise necessary to compete in what could become a much larger industry. D. E. Shaw was also interested in cashing in its investment. A new entity created as a result of the deal, Orsted US Offshore Wind, will be led by Mr. Grybowski and Orsted’s current North America chief, Thomas Brostrom. Both men said Orsted would be able to draw on its expertise to build and run the projects that Deepwater was awarded. “They can build big complicated things in the middle of the ocean,” Mr. Grybowski said. Northern European countries like Denmark, Britain and Germany have dominated offshore wind, which until recently required large subsidies to be economically viable. Costs have come down rapidly in recent years, however, and developers, including Orsted, have agreed to build some projects without the benefit of subsidies. By paying more than $500 million for a relatively small company with just one wind farm, Orsted appears to be confirming that the United States is considered the next big source of growth for this industry. Falling costs for offshore projects have caught the attention of electric power providers and investors in the United States, especially in the shallow waters off the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. By planting large arrays of turbines on the sea bottom, developers say, they can construct large installations that are mostly out of sight of land yet within easy transmission range of large population centers like Boston and New York. These projects can generate large amounts of electricity free of carbon dioxide emissions, and can be used to meet clean energy targets and to replace aging nuclear and coal-fired power stations. Among other states, New Jersey and New York have ambitions to build substantial offshore wind projects.",The New York Times
2018,"Osamu Shimomura, 90, Dies; Won Nobel for Finding a Glowing Protein","Osamu Shimomura, who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for his discovery of a glowing jellyfish protein that is now ubiquitous in biomedical research, died on Friday in Nagasaki, Japan. He was 90. Nagasaki University, his alma mater, announced his death. “Osamu was a quiet and brilliant researcher,” Martin L. Chalfie, a professor of biological sciences at Columbia University who shared the Nobel with Dr. Shimomura and Roger Y. Tsien of the University of California, San Diego, said by email. “What always struck me about Osamu was his intense dedication and masterful work on a fundamental problem in biology — how can different organisms generate light? — that was, ironically, far from the limelight before the Nobel.” In 1961, Dr. Shimomura, then a researcher at Princeton University, spent the summer scooping jellyfish, specifically the species Aequorea victoria, out of Puget Sound in Washington State. He was working for Frank H. Johnson, a Princeton marine biologist, who was interested in how the jellyfish glowed green when agitated. They extracted a luminescent material from thousands of them and took it back to Princeton for further study. By February of the next year, Dr. Shimomura recalled in his autobiography at the Nobel website, they had obtained about five milligrams of a nearly pure luminescent protein, which they named aequorin. Dr. Shimomura also found trace amounts of another protein that glowed green. That is now known as green fluorescent protein, or G.F.P. Unlike most other light-producing proteins, which require a reaction with other chemicals to glow, green fluorescent protein turned green simply when ultraviolet light was shined on it. Other scientists later determined the gene that produces G.F.P. and were then able to stitch it into the DNA of other organisms. With that genetic modification, fluorescent snippets were attached to proteins that biologists were interested in. Proteins are the machinery of cells, doing the work that keeps organisms alive. This became a revolutionary way for biologists to track the comings and goings and interactions of specific proteins, easily visible under a microscope — akin to attaching a GPS device to a person traveling through the tumult of a city. “The importance of Dr. Shimomura’s contribution to contemporary biological discovery cannot be overstated,” Nipam Patel, director of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., where Dr. Shimomura worked from 1982 to 2001, said in a statement. Osamu Shimomura was born on Aug. 27, 1928, in Kyoto, and his childhood and education were fractured by World War II. With his father serving in the Japanese Army, he and his brother and sister were sent to live with grandparents near Nagasaki. At 16 he graduated from high school without ceremony or diplomas, at a factory where his class had been sent to repair aircraft engines. On Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, he saw an American B-29 bomber drop two or three parachutes. A few minutes later, a second B-29 appeared. “At the moment I sat down on my work stool,” Dr. Shimomura wrote in his Nobel autobiography, “a powerful flash of light came through the small windows. We were blinded for about 30 seconds. Then, about 40 seconds after the flash, a loud sound and sudden change of air pressure followed. We were sure there was a huge explosion somewhere, but we didn’t know where.” It was the atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki. “The sky was rapidly filling with dark clouds,” he wrote, “and when I left the factory to walk home, about three miles away, a drizzling rain started. It was black rain. “By the time I arrived home, my white shirt had turned gray. My grandmother quickly readied a bath for me. That bath might have saved me from the ill effects of the strong radiation that presumably existed in the black rain.” A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 After the war, he repeatedly applied to college and was repeatedly rejected. He was finally admitted to Nagasaki Pharmacy College in 1948, even though he was not planning to become a pharmacist. He discovered an interest in chemistry there and graduated at the top of his class in 1951. (Nagasaki Pharmacy College later became part of Nagasaki University.) He was an assistant in a chemistry laboratory at Nagasaki for four years, then obtained a leave of absence to study for a year at Nagoya University. The professor he worked for, Yoshimasa Hirata, assigned him a seemingly impossible task: to try to crystallize a glowing organic compound called luciferin, found in a small crustacean in the coastal waters of Japan. A renowned zoologist at Princeton, E. Newton Harvey, had tried for 20 years to make crystals of luciferin and failed. Dr. Shimomura succeeded after 10 months. His stay at Nagoya was extended a year, and he and Professor Hirata published a paper describing their findings. It caught the attention of Dr. Johnson, a disciple of Dr. Harvey’s, who in 1959 offered the young scientist a job in his laboratory. In the 1970s, Dr. Shimomura examined aequorin, green fluorescent protein and other bioluminescent materials. In 1982, he moved to the Marine Biological Laboratory as a senior scientist. He retired in 2001. Dr. Shimomura received the Asahi Prize, one of the most prestigious honors in Japan, in 2006. He later noted that the Washington waters where he and his co-workers had collected so many Aequorea jellyfish — 850,000 over 19 trips from 1961 to 1988 — had become polluted, and that after 1990 the jellyfish became sparse, perhaps as a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska in 1989. If the disappearance had occurred 20 years earlier, he would never have learned about aequorin or green fluorescent protein. Dr. Shimomura is survived by his wife, Akemi Shimomura; a brother, Sadamu Fujiyama; a sister, Sumiko Sawayama; a son, Tsutomu; a daughter, Sachi Shimomura; and two grandchildren. In 2013, Dr. Shimomura went to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the birthplace of the atomic bomb, to give a talk about green fluorescent protein. While there he asked John E. Pearson, the Los Alamos scientist who had invited him, about the parachutes he had seen dropped by the first B-29 over Nagasaki. He had been told that they carried instruments to measure the explosion. After some hunting, models of the original parachute payloads were found. “Some guy came up and started explaining what we were looking at,” Dr. Pearson recalled. “Osamu said, ‘Yes. I watched them falling.’ I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone quite as stunned as that guy.” An earlier version of this obituary misidentified one of Dr. Shimomura’s survivors. He is survived by his sister Sumiko Sawayama but not by his sister Setsuko, who died before him.",The New York Times

2018,Our 2018-19 N.B.A. Predictions,"Do you want Marc Stein’s N.B.A. insights sent directly to your inbox? Sign up for our weekly N.B.A. newsletter here. ——- There are many lessons to take from this year’s N.B.A. off-season, like always listen when players warn you about not trading them, and Lakers jerseys shouldn’t have pinstripes. But one lesson outweighs them all: The N.B.A. will always find a way to surprise us. Sure, Golden State will probably win another championship, and we can all see that coming. But before then, no one is sure what will happen. All we can do is guess, and The New York Times sports staff and friends are here to do just that. Our Marc Stein has also offered the rationale behind some of his forecasts. Here are the predictors … • Harvey Araton, Hall of Fame sportswriter • Scott Cacciola, staff writer • Sopan Deb, staff writer • Sam Dolnick, assistant managing editor • Benjamin Hoffman, senior staff editor • Shauntel Lowe, senior staff editor • Kelly Whiteside, contributor … and here are our predictions for most of the major awards, plus a couple of our own: Stein: LeBron James (Lakers) There are too many questions about LeBron’s youthful (and unpredictable) supporting cast in L.A. to peg this as a 50-win team. But dragging the Lakers to the playoffs for the first time in six seasons, which will require close to 50 wins, should be enough for King James to hold off Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis and the rest of the chasing pack to win his first regular-season M.V.P. Award since 2013. • Araton: LeBron James (Lakers) • Cacciola: LeBron James (Lakers) • Deb: Anthony Davis (New Orleans) • Dolnick: Anthony Davis (New Orleans) • Hoffman: Joel Embiid (Philadelphia) • Lowe: LeBron James (Lakers) • Whiteside: LeBron James (Lakers) Stein: Luka Doncic (Dallas) He’s been playing professional basketball since he was 16 and thus begins his N.B.A. career as the most N.B.A.-ready rookie in the race. It will make the difference in his R.O.Y. battle with Deandre Ayton, Trae Young, Kevin Knox, etc. • Araton: Trae Young (Atlanta) • Cacciola: Luka Doncic (Dallas) • Deb: Luka Doncic (Dallas) • Dolnick: Luka Doncic (Dallas) • Hoffman: Kevin Knox (Knicks) • Lowe: Luka Doncic (Dallas) • Whiteside: Deandre Ayton (Phoenix) Stein: Mike Budenholzer (Milwaukee) If the Bucks breach 50-win territory and Antetokounmpo makes a real run at M.V.P., as more and more experts seem to predict, rest assured that the new coach in Milwaukee will get a healthy (and deserved) slice of the credit. • Araton: Quin Snyder (Utah) • Cacciola: Kenny Atkinson (Nets) • Deb: Mike Budenholzer (Milwaukee) • Dolnick: Brad Stevens (Boston) • Hoffman: Nick Nurse (Toronto) • Lowe: Brad Stevens (Boston) • Whiteside: Brad Stevens (Boston) Stein: Julius Randle (New Orleans) Randle posted good numbers in his final season as a Laker, but I see him going to a new level as the marquee sidekick to New Orleans’s star duo of Davis and Jrue Holiday. • Araton: Brandon Ingram (Lakers) • Cacciola: Brandon Ingram (Lakers) • Deb: D’Angelo Russell (Nets) • Dolnick: Markelle Fultz (Philadelphia) • Hoffman: Dennis Smith Jr. (Dallas) • Lowe: Lonzo Ball (Lakers) • Whiteside: D’Angelo Russell (Nets) Stein: Dennis Schröder (Oklahoma City) Oklahoma City’s last big risk — trading for the free agent-to-be Paul George — worked out as well as it possibly could have. I expect the trade for Schroder to go down as another good gamble. • Araton: Marcus Smart (Boston) • Cacciola: Lou Williams (Clippers) • Deb: Carmelo Anthony (Houston) • Dolnick: Trey Burke (Knicks) • Hoffman: Julius Randle (New Orleans) • Lowe: Jaylen Brown (Boston) • Whiteside: Lou Williams (Clippers) Stein: Sam Presti (Oklahoma City) My confidence in the Schroder dice role stems largely from the fact that Presti, long considered one of the league’s sharpest executives, believed in the move so strongly. One caveat here, though: Houston’s Daryl Morey, who won this award last season, becomes the new favorite if he can swing a trade for the All-Star guard Jimmy Butler. • Araton: Danny Ainge (Boston) • Cacciola: Sam Presti (Oklahoma City) • Deb: Rob Pelinka (Lakers) • Dolnick: Rob Pelinka (Lakers) • Hoffman: Rob Pelinka (Lakers) • Lowe: Rob Pelinka (Lakers) • Whiteside: Rob Pelinka (Lakers) • Araton: Boston Celtics • Cacciola: Golden State Warriors • Deb: Golden State Warriors • Dolnick: Boston Celtics • Hoffman: Boston Celtics • Lowe: Boston Celtics • Whiteside: Golden State Warriors • Araton: Sacramento Kings/Phoenix Suns • Cacciola: Phoenix Suns • Deb: Sacramento Kings • Dolnick: Sacramento Kings • Hoffman: Orlando Magic • Lowe: Orlando Magic • Whiteside: Sacramento Kings • Araton: Jamal Murray (Denver) • Cacciola: Lauri Markkanen (Chicago) • Deb: Jamal Murray (Denver) • Dolnick: Ben Simmons (Philadelphia) • Hoffman: Lauri Markkanen (Chicago) • Lowe: Collin Sexton (Cleveland) • Whiteside: Brandon Ingram (Lakers) Stein: Will Jimmy Butler be traded before Christmas? Yes. Will Anthony Davis be traded this season? Absolutely not. Who will be the first coach fired? Dave Joerger in Sacramento. • Araton: Kenny Atkinson’s Nets sneak into the Eastern Conference playoffs. • Cacciola: This might not qualify as “wild,” given the problems (and defections) the team has endured in recent months, but the Spurs will miss the postseason for the first time since 1997. And while we’re at it, here’s another one: The Nets will actually make the playoffs. • Deb: The Lakers and Spurs won’t make the playoffs. It’s not even a wild prediction. It’s a brutal conference, and LeBron will have to do more work than he did with last year’s Cleveland team. At some point, that has to catch up with you. This will be the year. As for the Spurs, the run had to end sometime. The top-shelf talent isn’t there, and injuries aren’t helping out of the gate. • Dolnick: Carmelo Anthony won’t finish the season in Houston. • Hoffman: The Suns finish near .500. • Lowe: My safe pick, as you can see, is that the Houston Rockets will be in the Western Conference finals. But deep down, I expect them to lose in the first or second round. They will be a good team, for sure. But when the playoffs roll around, a lower seed will give them everything it has, and it will be too much. • Whiteside: The Knicks may have the best trio of rookies in the league. (But still might not win 30 games.) Stein: Boston Celtics over Toronto Raptors Either of these clubs, if everything goes right and they reach their respective ceilings, is equipped to at least stretch a finals series with Golden State to six games. But we’re not talking small ifs: Boston must seamlessly reintegrate Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward without stunting the growth of its young players; Toronto needs a full return to health (or close to it) from Kawhi Leonard. • Araton: Boston Celtics over Toronto Raptors • Cacciola: Boston Celtics over Toronto Raptors • Deb: Boston Celtics over Toronto Raptors • Dolnick: Boston Celtics over Philadelphia 76ers • Hoffman: Boston Celtics over Toronto Raptors • Lowe: Boston Celtics over Philadelphia 76ers • Whiteside: Boston Celtics over Toronto Raptors Stein: Golden State Warriors over Houston Rockets This pick means that, yes, I expect Draymond Green’s recent knee issues to be manageable as the season progresses — and, yes, I believe Cousins will hush the skeptics who say he can’t fit with the Warriors’ style. Yet the caveat from the Executive of the Year section also applies here: Houston will force us all to re-evaluate things if it acquires Butler and persuades Carmelo Anthony to embrace role-player status at last. • Araton: Golden State Warriors over Utah Jazz • Cacciola: Golden State Warriors over Houston Rockets • Deb: Golden State Warriors over Houston Rockets • Dolnick: Golden State Warriors over Houston Rockets • Hoffman: Golden State Warriors over Houston Rockets • Lowe: Golden State Warriors over Houston Rockets • Whiteside: Golden State Warriors over Houston Rockets Stein: Golden State Warriors over Boston Celtics Apologies if my unadventurous playoff picks disappoint you. There are countless interesting diversions to tantalize us during the 1,230 regular-season games we’re about to witness, but the postseason is still the Warriors’ world until further notice. Like it or not. • Araton: Boston Celtics over Golden State Warriors • Cacciola: Golden State Warriors over Boston Celtics • Deb: Golden State Warriors over Boston Celtics • Dolnick: Golden State Warriors over Boston Celtics • Hoffman: Golden State Warriors over Boston Celtics • Lowe: Golden State Warriors over Boston Celtics • Whiteside: Golden State Warriors over Boston Celtics",The New York Times

2018,Our Fourth Annual Student Review Contest,"Contests Update, Aug. 29, 2019: • Find details about our 2019 contest here. • We have announced the winners and published 10 winning reviews. _________ Do you have strong opinions about books, music, fashion, restaurants or TV shows? Are you a theater buff or a foodie? If so, you’re in luck. Between now and Nov. 13, 2018, we invite you to play critic and write an original review for our fourth annual Student Review Contest. What can you choose? Anything that fits into a category of creative expression that The New York Times covers — from architecture to video games. We do ask, however, that you pick something new to you. Part of the reason we are creating this contest is to encourage you to stretch your cultural imagination. So go see a local art, design or fashion show; explore a building; watch a movie or TV show or dance performance or play; listen to an album; read a book; play a game or eat in a restaurant that is novel and interesting to you. Experience whatever you choose with an open mind and an eye for detail, and then — perhaps using the many examples and tips in this related lesson plan to help — put your experience into words. Oscar Wilde wrote that “to the critic, the work of art is simply a suggestion for a new work of his own.” Consider that your challenge, and use the submission form below to send us your best. You can find the rules, and the criteria we will use to judge the entries, beneath the form. For inspiration, you might consider reading last year’s winning reviews. Once again, this year’s winners will be published on The Learning Network. _________ Required fields are marked with an asterisk. 1. Review something that fits into one of the categories of creative expression that The Times reviews. • books (fiction, nonfiction and children’s books)• video games• music (albums and events, popular and classical)• movies• theater• TV shows• fashion• architecture• dance• art• restaurants• hotels• technology 2. Be concise. The review must be 450 words or less, not including the title. (But remember: Reviews don’t have to be long to be compelling. For inspiration, look at many of Neil Genzlinger’s TV reviews, such as this 252-word take on the zombie movie “Cooties.”) The submission form uses a word counter, so be sure to use only a single space between words and after punctuation, otherwise the counter might count extra spaces as additional words. 3. Assert an opinion and back it up. A review is not simply a plot summary or description. State an opinion and support it with detail that makes your case. 4. Know your audience. Be mindful that you are submitting a review to The New York Times, not to a school newspaper, and that your potential audience therefore includes a broader cross-section of people. But, be sure to take into account who the creative work’s target audience is as well. For example, if you are reviewing a video game intended for 10-year-old girls, aim to write a review that will be useful for 10-year-old girls (and their parents). 5. Write something original. For this contest, you cannot submit anything you have already published, whether in a school newspaper or elsewhere. 6. Whatever you choose to review, it should be new to you. That doesn’t mean it can’t be a classic work and has been around for decades — just that it should be a fresh experience for you. 7. Use appropriate and engaging language, and give context. For more on what criticism should do and how, we suggest you read this advice from three Times critics, and use the many models and tips from our related lesson plan. 8. Submissions must be from students 13- to 19-years-old. Entries can come from anywhere in the world, but for this contest, we do not allow students to work in teams. 9. Only one submission per student is allowed. 10. All entries must be submitted by Nov. 13, 2018, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern. If you have any difficulty using the embedded form, please email us at LNfeedback@nytimes.com. 11. Follow these instructions if you need proof that you entered this contest. Within an hour of submitting your review, you should receive an email from “The New York Times” with the subject heading “Thank you for your submission to our Review Contest.” If you don’t receive the email within an hour, even after checking your spam folder, then you can resubmit your entry. Be sure your settings allow emails from nytimes.com. After two attempts and waiting over one full day, if you still have not received a confirmation email, you can contact us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com with the email address you used in the contest form. Use the subject heading “Please send me an email confirmation for my review contest submission.” Be sure to include your name and review title in your email. You may have to wait up to a week for a reply. 12. We will use this rubric (PDF) to judge the critiques, and winners will be published on The Learning Network.

2018,"Out of the Gallery, Into the Street","A massive Anish Kapoor sculpture integrated into the base of a TriBeCa building. Custom works by Robert Indiana and Olafur Eliasson featured at a condominium opening next year in Miami. And three artistic takes on the traditional scale model by the kinetic sculptor Es Devlin, which take up prime space in the sales gallery for the XI, a residential tower south of Hudson Yards in New York. All are examples of artists trading the white-box space of galleries for upscale commercial and residential real estate projects, an idea that might have been considered “selling out” a generation ago. “The gallery is a format that is struggling,” said the Argentine curator Ximena Caminos, formerly of the Malba museum in Buenos Aires and now chief creative officer of the Honey Lab cultural space in Miami’s Blue Heron hotel and residential project, which is now under development. “It’s transactional; the artist doesn’t have that much creative freedom, and there is a lot of pressure to make money in a short period of time.” Artists, she said, are seeking new places to showcase their work, especially if the pieces are large in scale. Enter the well-financed real estate developer. After the global financial crisis, when traditional sources of cultural funding were scaled back, corporate and individual donors stepped in to fill the void, according to Jennie Lamensdorf, who runs the Art-in-Buildings program for Time Equities, a commercial property developer based in New York. At first, well-established artists like Jeff Koons were commissioned to create pieces for condominiums in art hubs like Miami and New York. Less than a decade on, even early and midcareer artists are being lured by real estate developers to make art for public consumption — and reach an audience they might never have been exposed to. “Having art in the lobby can communicate that they are a company that cares about culture,” Ms. Lamensdorf said. Ms. Lamensdorf recently asked the abstract painter Claudia Chaseling to produce a permanent piece for the lobby of her company’s building at 55 Fifth Avenue, which opened Sept. 20. Ms. Chaseling, who is German, said she took on the “unusual challenge” with relish. “A public building gives me an opportunity to be visible on a different level than a gallery space would,” she said. “In galleries, people come to see art; in public buildings you have a lot of passers-by who have no clue about art — and I am all for as many people seeing my work as possible, and for everyone having their own perspective on it,” she said. Her “Radiationscape,” a response to the Indian Point nuclear power plant, drips from 55 Fifth Avenue’s wall onto the lobby floor. True, the commission is not exactly what one would expect from either an avant-garde artist or a real estate developer. “I don’t consider my work with developers as compromising my artistic integrity at all,” Ms. Chaseling added. Examples of major developers bringing large-scale artworks into the public sphere are especially prevalent in American art hubs like Chicago and Los Angeles, but the most prominent examples are found in New York and Miami. The Lever House in Midtown Manhattan, which is owned by the RFR co-founder and principal Aby Rosen, was an early adopter of this growing trend, and the midcentury building has become a de facto walk-by museum for the lunch crowd, which can view a rotating roster of large-scale pieces through the glassy walls. “Everyone can understand, when they stand in the presence of a piece, that feeling of ‘this is right’ for the space,” said Mr. Rosen. He helped found the Lever House Art Collection in 2003, which has commissioned pieces by artists like Jorge Pardo and John Chamberlain. The artist Rachel Feinstein, whom Mr. Rosen commissioned to do a large mirror painting for his new Foster & Partners-designed building, 100 East 53rd Street, said she appreciated the front-and-center placement her “Panorama of New York” would receive at the tower rising close to the Seagram Building. “About a billion people will see it — more people than a museum — with a much wider variety,” she said. Other developments are shifting the meaning of what — and where — an art gallery can be. Ms. Caminos hopes that her Honey Lab, which will include a gallery and art program, at Miami’s Blue Heron development will engage locals of every stripe. “To use art as cultural activation is beautiful,” she said. “Art is a bridge between socio-economic classes, an opportunity to give residents interesting conversations.” Also in Miami is KAR Properties’ One River Point, which has a fully developed, multidisciplinary arts program within its multiple public galleries and a riverfront park. One River Point’s rotating exhibition program will include shows conceived in collaboration with artists, guest curators and Miami arts institutions. In Chicago, Magellan Development Group worked with Tony Karman, president and director of Art Expo Chicago, to fill the sales gallery of its Jeanne Gang-designed Vista Tower, set to open in 2020, with artists whose works are represented by Chicago dealers. “We are targeting a very niche audience, one that will truly observe and potentially purchase these artists’ works,” said Robin Loewenberg Tebbe, chief marketing officer for Magellan. “The works idyllically complement the space.” Further afield, artists are also working with developers, even in places that are only just beginning to see the value in real estate and art partnerships. Cidade Matarazzo, a residential development in São Paulo, Brazil, is built around a “house of creativity,” a dedicated space for artists in residence. “I don’t think museums are the exclusive way to distill the message of the prophets of modern times,” the developer, Alexandre Allard, said of prominent artists today. “There is not much art in the street in Brazil. But I believe in the extraordinary potential of my country to convey messages about religion, community, race and ethnicity through art.” Mr. Allard hopes that 30 million people will visit his complex, which includes a hotel, and residential and commercial structures, each year and walk away astonished. “I believe Matarazzo is the model of the sustainable museum of the future,” he said. Carpenter & Company, in staid Boston, is following similar thinking. At the developer’s Four Seasons Hotel One Dalton Street, David Bowie’s personal curator, Kate Chertavian, is “using the vocabulary of Boston” to put pieces on the walls — by established artists like Duke Riley, Yinka Shonibare and Tacita Dean — that have staying power. “There are a limited number of spaces where collections can be permanently on view, and artists enjoy being included in one,” Ms. Chertavian said. Erica Samuels, who has curated projects such as the lobby of Extell’s One57 in Manhattan, is always on the hunt for new places for artists to present their works, and the semipublic nature of a real estate development, she said, is a sign that the art world is evolving. “I think we may be entering a new age of patronage,” she said. “There is a great responsibility on the real estate developers that maybe they don’t even realize, while at the same time, the stigma of an artist working with a rich developer is fading.” Ultimately, Ms. Samuels said, galleries are still a place of prestige, but “everyone is craving a new way to create a dialogue and to be a part of culture.” She said she thought of this as a new way to construct the perfect triumvirate. “A smart developer hires a great architect, who needs a great interior designer, who needs a great artist,” she explained. “Taken together, you can bring out the best gestalt of a space.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the artist whose work will be featured at a condominium opening next year in Miami. The artist is Robert Indiana, not Gary Indiana.",The New York Times
2018,Outrage Over a Handshake Between Khashoggi Son and the Crown Prince,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The image of the Saudi crown prince shaking the hand of a son of the slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi stoked outrage on social media on Wednesday as suspicions continue that the crown prince had a role in the killing. Many Turkish and American officials believe that the operation that ended up killing Mr. Khashoggi could not have gone ahead without the knowledge of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. Khashoggi’s son Salah is a dual Saudi-American citizen and has been barred from leaving the kingdom, friends of the family say, presumably to keep his relatives who are already in the United States from speaking out about the killing. “This photo makes me want to scream and throw up,” Manal al-Sharif, a Saudi activist living in Australia, wrote on Twitter. The images were released late Tuesday as the kingdom was struggling to push back against the international uproar over Mr. Khashoggi’s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials have said he was met there by a 15-man hit squad who killed him and dismembered his body with a bone saw. After nearly three weeks of denials, Saudi Arabia acknowledged last week that the team had killed Mr. Khashoggi, but said that it had been acting without the knowledge of the kingdom’s leadership and had accidentally strangled Mr. Khashoggi after a fistfight. But that story has failed to stop the damage to the kingdom’s reputation as the country’s allies have called for further explanation and as businessmen and investors have dropped out of a headline investment conference this week in Riyadh. In a video released by Saudi state television, the Saudi monarch, King Salman, and Crown Prince Mohammed, his son, enter an ornate room where two relatives of Mr. Khashoggi are waiting. The video has no sound, so it is unclear what was said, but the younger Mr. Khashoggi appears stone-faced when the crown prince shakes his hand. Not all reactions to the encounter were negative. One Twitter user under the name Turki Ibn Barak expressed condolences to the family of Mr. Khashoggi and said “May our leadership remain strong and noble.” But others found the handshake upsetting given the suspicions that the crown prince had a role in the killing. “Sickening to see #Khashoggi’s oldest son Salah summoned to receive condolences from the person suspected of murdering his father,” wrote Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “Jamal told me months ago that the Saudi government is not allowing his son to leave Saudi Arabia. He is being held against his will.”",The New York Times
2018,Outspoken Trump Supporter in Florida Charged in Attempted Bombing Spree,"An outspoken supporter of President Trump from South Florida was charged on Friday with sending explosive packages to at least a dozen of the president’s critics, apparently bringing to a close an attempted bombing spree that has gripped the country just ahead of the midterm elections. The suspect, Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr., 56, was arrested outside an auto parts store near Fort Lauderdale after a fast-moving investigation in which the authorities said they were able to pull a fingerprint from one of the bomb packages and collect Mr. Sayoc’s DNA from two others. Mr. Sayoc, who seemed to be living out of a van in Aventura, Fla., was taken into custody on a day when four more explosive packages were found, including two intended for United States senators, both Democrats. A federal criminal complaint spells out his contempt for this week’s many bomb targets, noting that Mr. Sayoc’s van was slathered with images and slogans often found on fringe right-wing social media accounts. The complaint identifies a Twitter account that authorities said he used to rail against Democratic figures, and it notes that both his social media messages and the bomb packages used the same misspelling — “Hilary Clinton” — for Mr. Trump’s 2016 opponent. Mr. Sayoc also posted frequently on right-wing social media groups, the authorities said. On Facebook, Mr. Sayoc published photos of a Trump rally he attended during the 2016 presidential campaign. He was wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat. Of the four bombs discovered on Friday, one was addressed to Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat; another was sent to James R. Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence; and a third was intercepted before it reached Senator Kamala Harris, a California Democrat. Tom Steyer, a prominent Democratic donor, said a fourth package was addressed to him and found in a California mail center. In all, Mr. Sayoc is believed to have sent at least 14 bombs to 12 targets, all of whom are regularly disparaged by the right. At a news conference in Washington, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Mr. Sayoc had been charged with five federal crimes, including the interstate transportation of an explosive, the illegal mailing of explosives and making a threat against a former president and others. The packages sent by Mr. Sayoc included photographs of his intended targets, each one marked with a red X, according to the criminal complaint. When asked why Mr. Sayoc had sent the bombs to Democrats, Mr. Sessions said that he was not sure, but added that the suspect “appears to be a partisan.” The F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, said that the bureau was still trying to determine if Mr. Sayoc’s bombs were “functional” but noted that they contained “energetic material” that could be dangerous. Mr. Wray said that the investigation was “active” and cautioned that there could be more bombs still undiscovered. The criminal complaint against Mr. Sayoc was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and detailed the five charges against him. (PDF, 11 pages, 0.13 MB) Speaking at the White House earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials for quickly arresting a suspect. “These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,” he said. But in a Friday night rally in Charlotte, N.C., the president accused the news media of trying to use Mr. Sayoc’s political leanings to “score political points against me and the Republican Party.” “The media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people,” he said. Mr. Sayoc is a registered Republican whose arrest record in Florida dates back to 1991 and includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as allegations that he threatened to use a bomb, public records show. His criminal history from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicates that he listed his occupation some years ago as “manager.” According to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his mother’s home. “Lives w/mom,” a handwritten note on the petition said. “Has no furniture.” [Read more on what we know about the suspect, Cesar Sayoc Jr.] Mr. Sayoc was arrested around 11 a.m. Friday outside an AutoZone car repair shop in Plantation, Fla., about 20 miles from Aventura, officials said. Patrol cars shut down the surrounding streets, leaving rows of businesses inaccessible for part of the morning. The authorities also seized and towed away Mr. Sayoc’s white van, where he was apparently living. At least 14 explosive packages have been discovered since Monday. Here are where they were found and who they were addressed to. Monday Wednesday Hillary Clinton John O. Brennan George Soros Barack Obama Maxine Waters Maxine Waters Eric H. Holder Jr. Thursday Friday Robert De Niro James R. Clapper Jr. Kamala Harris Tom Steyer Joseph R. Biden Jr. Cory Booker Monday Wednesday Hillary Clinton John O.

Clapper Jr. Kamala Harris Tom Steyer A device intended for Mr. Holder was misaddressed and sent to Debbie Wasserman Schultz's office because her name was on the return address. Two packages each were addressed to Mr. Biden and Ms. Waters. | By Jugal K. Patel and Joe Ward Some residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van, the windows of which were plastered with a thick collage of pro-Trump stickers, often parked in the lot of a strip mall, the Shoppes at the Waterways. Photos of the van showed that one of the stickers depicted a heroic Mr. Trump standing in front of flames and the American flag. Another was of Mrs. Clinton’s face in the cross hairs of a rifle scope. A third said: “CNN Sucks.” “It struck me because of the crazy, conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,” said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer who until recently lived in Aventura and often noticed the van. “It was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied. Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van.” The criminal complaint against Mr. Sayoc was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, where he will be prosecuted. Five of the bombs sent this week fall under the jurisdiction of federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Mr. Sayoc is expected to appear before a judge in Florida on Monday. A lawyer from the Federal Defenders office in Manhattan, Sarah Baumgartel, was assigned to represent him. “We hope that he will be presented in court and brought to New York expeditiously so that the case can proceed,” Ms. Baumgartel said. For months now, Mr. Trump has been attacking the F.B.I., ridiculing its officials and damaging morale at the bureau. The swift arrest on Friday was a public win for Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and a reminder of his agency’s effectiveness. Commissioner James P. O’Neill of the New York Police Department also praised the F.B.I., sending a message that the two agencies, along with some half a dozen others that took part in the investigation, were in lock step. One law enforcement official said the investigation came together less than 24 hours before the announcement, with a preliminary DNA match first and the fingerprint match coming sometime Friday morning. Later on Friday, federal authorities executed a search warrant at a residence associated with Mr. Sayoc, but he had been living in his van. Agents conducted a preliminary sweep of the vehicle before towing it to the F.B.I. office, where they were expected to search it later on Friday. The official said that during an interview with agents, Mr. Sayoc denied playing any role in the bombing campaign. “He denied all knowledge of making the bombs,” the official said. “Any time they brought up the devices, he wouldn’t say anything about them.” Mr. Sayoc was first interviewed under a national security exception that allows defendants to be questioned without being advised of their rights to a lawyer. After he was given his Miranda warnings and told he could have a lawyer, “he invoked his right to counsel pretty quickly,” the official said. Mr. Sayoc declined to answer further questions. Of the packages discovered on Friday, the one addressed to Mr. Clapper, the former senior intelligence official, was meant for the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said. The package addressed to Mr. Booker was found in Florida. The device sent to Ms. Harris’s district office in Sacramento, Calif., was discovered at a mail facility there, she said in a statement on Friday. Mr. Steyer said the device addressed to him had been intercepted at a mail facility in Burlingame, Calif. Speaking on CNN on Friday, Mr. Clapper said he was not surprised that a device had been sent to him. [A look at the contentious words between the president and some of his most outspoken critics] “This is definitely domestic terrorism,” Mr. Clapper said. “Anyone who has in any way been a critic, publicly been a critic of President Trump, needs to be on an extra alert.” Other packages have been addressed to former President Barack Obama; former Secretary of State Clinton; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat; former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.; John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, the actor Robert De Niro; and George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor. All of the packages had return address labels bearing the misspelled name of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida. They each were affixed with six first-class stamps, and the explosive devices were contained in plain manila envelopes. While investigators initially thought that some of the devices were hand delivered, federal officials now believe that all were sent through the mail. Using information collected by the United States Postal Service, investigators had focused their attention on certain Florida postal centers, including one in Opa-locka near Miami.",The New York Times
2018,"Over 80,000 Americans Died of Flu Last Winter, Highest Toll in Years","Global health Among the dead were 180 babies, children and teenagers, more than in any year since the C.D.C. began tracking pediatric deaths. More than 80,000 Americans died of the flu in the winter of 2017-2018, the highest number in over a decade, federal health officials said last week. Although 90 percent of those deaths were in people over age 65, the flu also killed 180 young children and teenagers, more than in any other year since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began using its current surveillance methods. The estimates were released at a news conference held by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases to urge Americans to get vaccinated and to fight the myths that scare off some people — such as the common misconception that flu shots can cause flu. The high mortality rate was unusual because it was caused by a “normal” — albeit severe — flu season, not by a new pandemic influenza strain. In the 2009-2010 swine flu epidemic, by contrast, 59 million Americans are thought to have caught the novel strain that first appeared in the spring, but only about 12,000 died because the infection was relatively mild, according to the C.D.C. (That flu, an H1N1 strain, was called a “swine flu,” despite the objections of the pork industry, because it emerged in a pig-farming region of Mexico and was the first human flu virus to contain genes from both North American and Eurasian pig flus.) The dominant strain last season was an H3N2 flu, which is usually the most deadly of the four seasonal flu strains that typically circulate. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Last season’s flu vaccine was only about 40 percent effective at preventing infection — approximately the same as the previous season’s, according to the C.D.C. Vaccine effectiveness varies quite a bit each year, from a high of 60 percent in 2010-11 to a low of 19 percent in 2014-2015. It is impossible to know yet how effective this year’s vaccine will be. Infectious disease specialists have long expressed frustration that medical science has not come up with a universal lifetime flu vaccine. Currently available vaccines target the spikes on the virus’s outer shell, which are the parts that mutate the fastest. Because it takes more than six months to make each year’s vaccine, manufacturers have to choose in February what strains to put into shots that will be shipped in September. During that interim, circulating flus can mutate to become a partial mismatch to whatever was chosen. But experts still urge people to get even imperfect shots, because while they may be only 40 percent effective at warding off body aches and runny noses, they are much more effective at preventing influenza’s worst outcome — death.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Annemarie Schwarzenbach, Author, Photographer and ‘Ravaged Angel’","A Swiss heiress, she was an adventurous traveler whose writings, along with her androgynous glamour and troubled life, made her a gay cult figure after her death. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. It was the summer of 1939, in the last weeks before war would sweep across Europe, and Annemarie Schwarzenbach and Ella K. Maillart were embarking on a 4,000-mile drive from Geneva to Kabul, Afghanistan, with the goal of curing Schwarzenbach of her morphine addiction. At first it seemed as if this quixotic plan might be working: As the two women, both journalists and authors, made their way from Switzerland, through Italy and on into Yugoslavia, they stopped at roadside campsites and small village inns, choosing to steer clear of towns and cities where drugs might be available. Indeed, one night, as they slept under the stars outside Belgrade, they were awakened by the sounds of village men cutting hay. Schwarzenbach, normally frail and intense, “seemed to revive,” Maillart wrote. But then, further east, in Bulgaria, at a hotel in Sofia, Schwarzenbach had her first slip. She woke up “seedy,” pale and vomiting, Maillart wrote. That she was using drugs again became clear when Maillart discovered “the brittle glass of an empty ampoule” in the bathroom. The women went on to endure a tense drive into Turkey, barely speaking, until, in Istanbul, Schwarzenbach turned to her friend and asked, “Why do you bother about me?” “Why do I bother about you? … I don’t know,” Maillart recalled replying. “I can’t say it is because I love you, because I detest you when I see such gifts as yours spoilt as they are.” The women would make it to Kabul but ultimately fail in their mission: Schwarzenbach fell back into old habits, and Maillart left her in frustration, going on to India and leaving Schwarzenbach in the hands of a pair of French archaeologists. Schwarzenbach eventually made her way back to Europe by boat, and three years later she died in a bicycle accident in the Swiss mountains. But Maillart, who went on to enjoy a long career as a travel writer, did not forget her. In “The Cruel Way: Switzerland to Afghanistan in a Ford, 1939,” her account of their journey published in 1947, she would portray her friend as both tragic and transcendent. And she would recant the declaration she had made in the car. “I think I loved her profoundly,” she wrote. Schwarzenbach was an accomplished journalist, novelist and photographer whose work was in many ways overshadowed by the drama of her life. An heiress, she was born in Zurich on May 23, 1908, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Her mother was the daughter of a general and a descendant of the Bismarck family. Early on, her mother, who was bisexual, dressed Annemarie in boys’ clothes. (Schwarzenbach would enjoy wearing men’s clothes for the rest of her life.) Her androgynous glamour left a strong impression on the intellectual circles in which she mingled. The novelist Thomas Mann, whose children were close to Schwarzenbach, called her a “ravaged angel.” And the unrequited passion she inspired in the American author Carson McCullers would lead to a Suzanne Vega song, “Lover, Beloved,” written from McCullers’s point of view more than seven decades later. (“Everyone wants you / Everyone loves you / How can I possibly compete?”) The photographer Marianne Breslauer, who made memorable images of Schwarzenbach, echoed Mann when she said that at first glance Schwarzenbach appeared to be neither man nor woman but “like the Archangel Gabriel.” Schwarzenbach spent much of her adult life as an addict. She had numerous tumultuous love affairs with women. She had a complicated relationship with her family, who had Nazi sympathies. And she fell out with the Mann family, who thought her anti-fascism efforts were inadequate because she refused to cut ties with her Nazi-supporting relatives. It was an estrangement that hurt her profoundly, in part because she was in love with Thomas Mann’s daughter Erika Mann. Schwarzenbach attempted suicide twice. After she died of her bicycle accident injuries at 34 on Nov. 15, 1942, in the Swiss town of Sils im Engadin — she had been showing off by riding with no hands — her mother, defying her daughter’s will, destroyed Schwarzenbach’s papers for fear of how they might reflect on the family. Schwarzenbach’s work — ranging from striking photographs of Hitler youth to novels, from critiques of Swiss neutrality to travelogues from Central Asia — would not be rediscovered in her native Switzerland until the late 1980s, when the country began re-evaluating its World War II history. (Much of her written work is unavailable in English.) One of her earliest books, “Lyric Novella,” tells the story of a young man from a wealthy family not unlike Schwarzenbach’s who rejects his family’s plans for him in order to pursue his obsession with a nightclub singer. The novel, said the book’s translator, Lucy Renner Jones, is a pitch-perfect portrait of an era in which to be a member of the upper class was to be a slave to family duty. For all her seeming fragility, Schwarzenbach was adventurous. One of her best-known books, “Death in Persia,” was based on the years she lived in Tehran as a diplomat’s wife (a marriage of convenience; her husband was also gay). During that period she fell in love and had an affair with a Turkish diplomat’s daughter. On her travels with Maillart from Switzerland to Afghanistan, the two women engaged in high-speed chases with the police in Azerbaijan and ran away from officials near the Iran-Afghanistan border. (Maillart died in her mountain chalet in Switzerland in 1997 and received an obituary in The Times.) Schwarzenbach also spent time in the United States as a freelance reporter and photographer, traveling in the Deep South and across Pennsylvania, focusing on the mining and steel industries there. Her photographs from those travels reveal a journalist intensely interested in the social dynamics around her. And though Mann and others saw Schwarzenbach as a beautiful but troubled soul, they may have been buying what she was selling. She knew very well what effect she had on people and cultivated her public persona carefully, according to her great-nephew Alexis Schwarzenbach, a historian who has written a book about her. “That was part of the package,” he said. In the decades since she was rediscovered, Schwarzenbach has become something of a cult figure in Europe, though just what she represents remains unsettled. To some she was an anti-fascist; to others, her anti-fascism did not go far enough. To some she was an early L.B.G.T. heroine; to others she was remarkable for her refusal to be defined by any gender conventions. In one of the most famous images of her taken by Breslauer, Schwarzenbach, in her mid-20s, wears a fitted sweater over a collared shirt. Her hair close cropped, she stares straight at the camera. She is unsmiling, her face half obscured by shadow, her expression languorous. It’s a remarkable face, onto which many things can be projected.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Miki Gorman, the Unlikely Marathon Winner ","Gorman at 40, was self-conscious about her body and had recently given birth when she entered the New York City Marathon. Her win made her that much more of a pioneer for women in the sport. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Miki Gorman was sitting alone at a corner table of a Magic Pan restaurant in Manhattan on Oct. 23, 1976, when her food arrived: not one, but two large crepes stuffed with mushroom and spinach souffle. A couple sitting nearby gawked at her. Gorman, at 5 feet tall or so, weighed only 90 pounds, and the plates of food covered her table. “I’m running the New York City Marathon tomorrow!” she told them. “And I’m going to win.” And so she did, the first woman to cross the finish line the next day. Even more, she won again the following year. No other American woman would take the title for the next four decades. “We’ve gone so long without winning, I can’t believe it,” Gorman told The Washington Post in 2004, long after her retirement in 1982. “My win was a lifetime ago.” It wasn’t until 2017 that Shalane Flanagan would end the 40-year drought, crying, cursing and pumping her fist as she broke the finish line tape at 2:26:53. It was no small feat; by that time the New York City Marathon had become the world’s largest race, with more than 50,000 participants. (This year’s marathon is on Sunday.) Gorman was not around to see Flanagan’s victory; she died on Sept. 19, 2015, at 80, in Bellingham, Wash. The cause was metastasized lung cancer, her daughter, Danielle Nagel, said. Despite Gorman’s accomplishments, news of her death was not widely reported at the time. No word of it reached The New York Times. If it had, readers would have learned of record-breaking achievements that landed her in several halls of fame. One feat, in 1978, was a world best for a woman in the half marathon, at 1:15:58. She also won the Boston Marathon in the women’s category in 1974 and 1977, the latter victory coming, remarkably, the same year that she won in New York. She is the only woman known to have won both races twice. “She ran everything, from track races and really quick stuff all the way to these 100-mile races,” said George Hirsch, chairman of New York Road Runners, a nonprofit running group that organizes the marathon. “There’s no one that I know of to this day who has that kind of a range and excelled in them all.” Her success followed a life of hardship. Gorman was born Michiko Suwa on Aug. 9, 1935, to Japanese parents in occupied China, where her father was working for Japan’s imperial army. They later moved to Tokyo; after World War II, she helped care for her younger twin brothers there. “My father returned from the military looking like a skeleton,” she wrote in a first-person account for The New York Times in 2005. “Well, we all looked like skeletons. We were always hungry.” Their diet, she wrote, had consisted of soybeans that had been soaked for a couple of days, along with a little rice. She was 28 in about 1963 when an American Army officer stationed in Japan offered her a job in the United States as a nanny. He brought her to his home in Pennsylvania, where she worked long hours doing household chores for the family. A few years later she answered an ad from California seeking a secretary who could speak both Japanese and English. She got the job and moved to Los Angeles. There she earned $300 a month (about $2,400 in today’s money), sending some of her pay home to her mother in Japan. In the 1960s she met and married Michael Gorman, a stockbroker from Cleveland. Miki Gorman worked as a secretary during her running years and afterward, retiring in 1994. She and her husband separated in 1982. Not long after their marriage she confided in him that she felt insecure about her looks. “I was embarrassed that I was so small,” she told Runner’s World magazine in 2010. Her husband suggested that she accompany him to an athletic club, thinking that if she exercised she would be hungrier and would eat more and put on weight. Though she didn’t gain weight, she returned to the club regularly to run along an indoor track. The club offered a trophy for the member who ran the most miles for a month, and in October 1968 Gorman set her sights on winning. The contest included a 100-mile race that would involve running 1,075 laps on the track. She began training. “The first year I stopped at 86 miles,” she said. “I cried.” The following weekend she ran more than 20 miles, surpassing her competitors. “I got a huge trophy,” she told The New York Times in 2010. She returned the next year and finished all 100 miles, then competed in the race again the next three years. Gorman started running in cross-country races and found that she could win easily. Once she began passing taller and younger women, she realized that her height and weight were not disadvantages. “I gained so much confidence from my running,” she said. “I finally realized that being small didn’t have to hold me back.” Laszlo Tabori, the celebrated Hungarian coach who was then based in Los Angeles (he died in May), took notice of her wins and began training her. By the time Gorman signed up for the New York City Marathon in 1975 — five years after its inception — she was an unlikely candidate to win. She was already 40, considered old for an elite runner, and had given birth to a daughter, her only child, at the start of the year. But while most runners train to build up to the 26.2-mile distance, Gorman had been running 100-mile distances. She wound up finishing second among women, behind Kim Merritt. The next year was the first time the marathon course would traverse all five boroughs of New York City, having until then been confined to loops through Central Park. Some 2,090 runners lined up at the start on Staten Island, by the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Only 88 of them were women. Gorman quickly lost sight of Merritt ahead of her. Still, she zipped along the course, dodging obstacles, according to the book “First Ladies of Running” (2016), by Amby Burfoot. Few roadside barriers protected the route in those days, and at one point a St. Bernard dog bounded right up to her. (“He was almost as tall as I was,” Gorman said.) Then there was the metal grating, now covered, on the Queensboro Bridge. (“My toes felt like they were on fire.”) The wind blowing against the runners was no help, either. (“I tucked behind the bigger runners whenever I could.”) But then she caught sight of Merritt and bore down on her. As they entered the hills of Central Park, the final stretch of the race, she rolled past Merritt, barely giving her a glance, and kept her pace all the way to the end. Her time was 2:39:11, a course record for women. A surprise awaited at the finish: The couple from the night before at the Magic Pan restaurant had come to watch the race. “She was happy to see them,” her daughter said. “And the couple was shocked that this little Japanese woman actually won.” Just as she said she would.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Minnie Mae Freeman Penney, Nebraska’s ‘Fearless Maid’","In one of America’s deadliest blizzards, a schoolteacher used quick thinking and resourcefulness to save more than a dozen students. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. It was unseasonably warm on Jan. 12, 1888, as Minnie Freeman made her way to a school in rural Nebraska, where she was a teacher. Temperatures had been climbing well into the 40s that month, a respite from the bitter cold that usually gripped the prairie in the dead of winter. Shortly after she arrived, the students, whose ages were about 5 to 15 — shuffled into the tiny Midvale School and the lesson began. By noon, a light morning frost had melted, and the sky seemed to be clearing. Then, over lunch, a deadly snowstorm struck. Hail pelted the windows. The wind grew violent. The mercury plummeted to 20 degrees below zero. In classrooms all around the state, teachers pondered how to keep their students safe. Some sent the children home early. Others hunkered down indoors as the storm intensified, burning coal to keep the rooms warm. Whatever Freeman decided to do, she would have to do it fast; the little schoolhouse could not withstand the wind. The door flew from its hinges, the tarpaper roof tore away, and the elements found their way inside. As Freeman tried to calm her frantic schoolchildren, the unexpected weather was quickly becoming a life-threatening emergency. She searched the classroom for supplies and came across some twine. She looped it around each pupil, then wrapped the end around her own body. Scooping the smallest child in her arms and shouting commands to the rest in tow, Freeman led her students into the storm for a dangerous trek to safety. “I’ve never felt such a wind,” she told a reporter from the Ord Quiz, a local newspaper, shortly after the disaster. “It blew the snow so hard that the flakes stung your face like arrows. All you could see ahead of you was a blinding, blowing sheet of snow.” But after a mile of treacherous terrain, Freeman and her human chain of more than a dozen children found refuge in a farmhouse. Not a single one had been lost. She would later learn that the fatal blizzard had devastated the greater Midwest region. Today it remains one of the deadliest blizzards in American history. (Most official sources point to hundreds of deaths, but the exact number is unknown.) It is often called the Children’s Blizzard, for the large number of young who perished. Freeman’s story of heroism captured the country’s attention, and she earned the nickname “Nebraska’s Fearless Maid.” She was said to have received almost 200 marriage proposals, on top of endless gifts and letters of praise from across the country. “People she didn’t even know thought this was some great quality that you could haul through a blizzard and save everybody,” said Freeman’s great-granddaughter Debbie Penney Witmer, who is a second-grade teacher in Las Vegas. In April of 1891, Freeman, then in her early 20s, married Edgar B. Penney, 25, in Omaha. They lived in Fullerton, Neb., where they raised two sons, Freeman and Frederick. Minnie Mae Freeman Penney’s descendants, some of whom call her “Mee-Maw,” live in Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, Washington and Spain. Two became teachers. Many details of Freeman’s early life have been lost to history, but she was born in 1867 or 1868 in Pennsylvania or New York, one of four children to William and Sarah Freeman. The family moved to Nebraska in 1871, settling in Howard County at a time when the adjacent Nance County was a Pawnee Indian reservation. Gayle Biddle Swicker, another great-granddaughter, shared anecdotes about Freeman’s childhood that have been passed down three or more generations. “They were among the first settlers in Nebraska,” said Ms. Swicker, 62, “and if I’ve got the story right, she’d hide under her mother’s skirt when the Indians came by asking for food because they were in a forced migration to a new reservation and they were starving.” Beyond Freeman’s career as a schoolteacher, she was a political and social activist in Nebraska and Chicago at a time when female public figures were few and far between. According to several newspapers, she was the first Republican national committeewoman to represent Nebraska; the first president of the Nebraska American Legion Auxiliary; state president of the Federation of Women’s clubs; part of the team that established a new Nebraska state seal; and a delegate, appointed by two of Nebraska’s governors, to local and national conferences. (Ms. Swicker saved a few certificates and awards that her great-grandmother had received. The default pronoun printed on them — “him” — had been crossed out and replaced by “her.”) One of Freeman’s great-granddaughters, Laurie Penney Wright, who until recently was a teacher and principal at an elementary school in Brighton, Wis., said she talked about Freeman as a role model for her students. “We don’t give women enough respect for what they’ve accomplished in this world,” she said. “The girls were always concerned about that, and I told them, ‘Here’s an example of what we can do.’ ” Freeman died on Nov. 1, 1943, in Chicago. She was believed to be 75. Her resourceful and dramatic rescue is immortalized in a Victorian parlor song by the composer William Vincent, “Thirteen Were Saved; Or Nebraska’s Fearless Maid.” The original sheet music is at History Nebraska, the state’s historical society. The song goes, in part: The brave girl gathered them about and prayed to God for aid, Then quick as thought from simple cord, a band of union made ... Then forth into the blinding storm, she lead them bravely out, One carried in her gentle arms, all cheered by word and shout … There is also a mosaic mural of Freeman amid a snowy scene at the Nebraska State Capitol. An episode of the television series, “The Folklorist,” recounts her rescue. But throughout her life, the schoolteacher said in a letter to the Omaha Daily Bee, she never desired fame: “Too much has already been said of an act of simple duty.” Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Rose Zar, a Holocaust Survivor Who Hid in Plain Sight","Zar worked in the home of a Nazi commander and saved dozens of Jewish orphans, then moved to the United States and shared her life story. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Unlike Anne Frank and thousands of other Jews who spent all or part of World War II sequestered in attics, caves or sewers, Rose Zar survived the Holocaust by hiding in the open. In October 1942, when she was 19, her father feared that the Nazis were closing in on the ghetto where they lived, in Piotrkow, Poland. Zar, who had been part of the Jewish resistance before the war broke out, was prepared. She grabbed her suitcase and forged passport and left her family behind. For the next three years, she would move around Poland, disguising herself as a Roman Catholic named Wanda Gajda. She relied on a mix of courage, intelligence and moxie to get herself out of delicate encounters with suspicious Poles who, she later said, would “turn a Jew in for a liter of flour.” Ruszka Guterman was born in Piotrkow on July 27, 1922. Her father, a leather craftsman who ran a shoe factory, told her that if she ever had to go into hiding, the best place would be the most obvious, where those pursuing her would never look. “He said you have to hide in the mouth of the wolf, under the officials’ nose,” Zar told the USC Shoah Foundation in 1996, “and watch that they don’t devour you.” Although she had earned a teaching certificate before leaving home, Zar was forced to find menial jobs like cleaning the stairs in a hospital or peeling potatoes in the kitchen of the local SS headquarters in Krakow. To keep out of trouble, she learned to laugh at the crude, often anti-Semitic jokes told by the Polish women she worked with. “I figured it like this,” Zar said in the Shoah Foundation interview. “You are born in the wrong times in history. You are an actress. You have to play your role good, because you pay one price. It is your life.” When an SS commander summoned her to his office for questioning, she felt certain that it was the end. She answered his queries, telling about her experience as a nurse and how she had learned to speak German fluently. Several days later, she was introduced to the commander’s wife. The encounter she had feared turned out to be a job interview. She spent the final years of the war as her father had advised, hiding in plain sight in the home of a Nazi commander as “Fräulein Wanda.” Her position afforded her luxuries: silk stockings borrowed from the commander’s wife and front-row seats to theater performances of “Faust” and “Der Rosenkavalier” intended only for Germans. Yet every day she concealed 50 Polish zlotys and her passport beneath her clothes in case she had to flee. She always had an escape route in mind. “In many ways she was very fearless and very much ahead of her time,” her son Howard Zar said. Decades later, she again drew on her father’s advice for the title of her memoir, “In the Mouth of the Wolf.” Written with Eric A. Kimmel and published in 1983, the book won the Association of Jewish Libraries’ Book Award and is taught in schools across the United States. Howard Zar recalled receiving a letter from a student who had read his mother’s memoir in class and summed up her spirited determination in more modern terms, praising her “as ‘a “downright gangsta.’ ” Once the Russians had chased the Nazis from Poland, Zar set up typing classes for young women in Krakow on the machine that she had taken with her from the commander’s home. After the war, she was reunited with her brother, who had also survived by concealing his Jewish identity, and her sweetheart from when she was a teenager, Mayer Zarnowiecki, a survivor of the Theresienstadt and Buchenwald concentration camps. They married in September 1945. (They later moved to the United States, where they shortened their last name to Zar.) When violence broke out against Jewish refugees in the Polish city of Kielce, Zar and her husband decided it was time to leave. They helped smuggle 139 Jewish refugee children with them through Czechoslovakia and into southern Germany, where they helped set up a school run by the International Refugee Organization and the United States Army. There, Zar taught orphans about their Jewish identity and helped them regain confidence. The International Refugee Organization praised Zar in a letter of recommendation for her “intensive devotion” to the children’s welfare “and much sacrifice of personal time to achieve the best results.” The children were resettled in Israel, many aboard the Exodus, a refugee ship memorialized in book and film after the British turned it away from Palestine in 1947 with 4,500 Holocaust survivors and other refugees onboard. She and her husband moved to South Bend, Ind., where they had two sons and a daughter. There, she taught Hebrew and prepared Jewish children for their bar and bat mitzvahs. She later became the head of Jewish education for the Jewish Federation of South Bend. Although neither she nor her husband came from particularly strict homes, they began keeping kosher and following the Sabbath. They also gave talks around the country about their stories of survival from the Holocaust. Zar died on Nov. 3, 2001, in South Bend. She was 79. Kimmel, the co-author of her memoir, remembered first talking to Zar about her life. He had been working on a Holocaust-themed novel for young readers and began asking Zar for details about her experiences. Once she began recounting her story, he realized it was better than anything he could invent. He offered to help her write it, and she agreed, on condition that the story remain hers and that she be allowed to review every word. “What makes the story unique is that it tells about a one-of-a-kind experience,” Kimmel said. “It doesn’t see the world in black and white. Treacherous Jews. Likable Germans. Heroic and despicable Poles. The human panorama is all too real. It holds up a mirror. What would we do? How would we choose?” While in Poland during World War II, Zar was forced to remain silent about her identity. Later, she felt compelled to break that silence. “ ‘Of course we must talk, we must tell the stories. Otherwise, they will be forgotten and the enemies will have won,’ ” Kimmel recalled her saying. “‘ I must talk about it. It is my duty to talk about it. If I don’t tell my story, who will?’ ”",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Yamei Kin, the Chinese Doctor Who Introduced Tofu to the West","Long before veggie burgers and soy lattes were fashionable, Kin was sent on a mission by the United States government to uncover the benefits of the soybean for Americans. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. In 1917 Yamei Kin, a Chinese-born doctor then living in New York, visited her homeland to study a crop that was virtually unknown to Americans: the soybean. By that point she had become something of a celebrity dietitian. For years before the mission to China she had been telling women’s clubs that tofu and other soy products were nutritious alternatives to meat, and that they required fewer resources to produce. She liked to say that they tasted “a little like brains and a little like sweetbreads.” “She was many decades ahead of her time in terms of promoting tofu to a wider American audience,” said Matthew Roth, the author of the book “Magic Bean: The Rise of Soy in America” (2018). It was the United States Department of Agriculture that approached Kin about going to China to study how the soybean could be used in America. The government saw her research as part of a wider effort to develop new sources of protein for American soldiers during World War I. Kin had a laboratory at the U.S.D.A., where she tested what the department called “Chinese soybean cheese,” and she presented soybean seeds to the department’s Bureau of Plant Industry. In addition, Roth said, some of her recipes were very likely included in “The Soybean,” a landmark study published in 1910 by William J. Morse and Charles V. Piper, officials at the Agriculture Department. “Americans do not know how to use the soybean,” Kin, then in her early 50s, told The New York Times Magazine in 1917, as she set out for China on her mission. “It must be made attractive or they will not take to it. It must taste good. That can be done.” An article in 1918 in The San Antonio Light offered this description of her lab: “On a long table was a row of glass jars filled with what looked like slices of white cheese. It was soy bean cheese. A jar was filled with a brownish paste. It was soy beans. There were bottles filled with the condiment we get with chop suey. That, too, was made from soy beans. Talk about dual personalities! The soy bean has so many aliases that if you shouldn’t like it in one form you would be pretty sure to like it in another.” In essays and correspondence at the time, U.S.D.A. colleagues expressed glowing praise for Kin’s work. “Very interesting,” Frank N. Meyer, a department botanist, wrote in 1911 in response to one of her letters. “There probably will come a time that soy beans are also given a nobler use in the United States than mere forage or green manure.” The Times Magazine noted that Kin’s research mission was the first time the United States had “given so much authority to a Chinese.” Kin did not live to see the soybean become popular in American society, and historians say the precise impact of her tofu advocacy in the United States is hard to measure. But she was apparently the first person in the federal government to promote the bean outside Asian immigrant communities — cultural eons before veggie burgers and soy lattes were fashionable. Kin’s U.S.D.A. assignment was just one chapter in a lifetime of professional trailblazing. Historians say she was among the first female students in China’s modern history to study overseas and earn a medical degree in the United States. Later, when she moved back to China, she ran a women’s hospital, founded a nursing school and reportedly served as the family physician to a president of the young republic. Kin’s career is remarkable partly because it unfolded against the backdrop of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which had effectively banned any immigration from China, and of the political turmoil in China surrounding the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. “That she shows up in so many places doing so many different things is very resonant,” said Madeline Y. Hsu, a historian at the University of Texas at Austin who studies migration between China and the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “It’s a really, really transnational story,” she added. Yamei Kin was born in 1864 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningpo, now called Ningbo, to a Chinese pastor and his wife, according to the SoyInfo Center in California. When Kin was 2, her parents died of cholera during an epidemic, and she was adopted by an American missionary couple, Divie Bethune and Juana McCartee. She was raised in China and Japan, where her adoptive father worked for the Education Ministry. After her parents moved to New York, Kin went to high school for a year in Rye, N.Y. At 16, she enrolled in the Women’s Medical College of New York under the name Y. May King, according to Roth’s book. Researchers believe she had altered her name to hide her ethnicity; she had been frequently reminded that she was one of few Chinese women studying in the United States at the time. “Workmen in the street would often hurl abuse at me, and even my fellow woman students were not particularly enthusiastic about me,” she was quoted as saying in “My Sister China” (2002), a memoir by Jaroslav Prusek, a Czech Sinologist who knew Kin in the 1930s. She graduated from the medical college in 1885 at the top of her class and published an article two years later in The New York Medical Journal that extolled the virtues of “photomicrography,” or photography through microscopes, for medical research. During the 1880s and ’90s Kin worked as a medical missionary in China and Japan. She married Hippolytus Laesola Amador Eça da Silva, a Macau-born musician of Portuguese and Spanish descent, in 1894. The couple settled in Hawaii, where Kin gave birth to a son. She later moved to California and separated from her husband. By 1903, Kin was traveling across the United States to lecture to women’s clubs about Chinese nutrition and other “things oriental,” including the opium crisis in China and the role of women there. Her profile was growing in the United States even as Chinese immigrants there were protesting the Chinese Exclusion Act, the country’s first anti-immigrant law directed at a specific nationality. She was part of a “transnational elite” and would have been exempt from the law, which targeted laborers, said Mae M. Ngai, a history professor at Columbia University and the author of “The Lucky Ones: One Family and the Extraordinary Invention of Chinese America.” In one sign of her elite status, President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to Kin in 1904 to express regret that he did not have the power to make her an American citizen. She was permitted to stay nonetheless. In 1907, Kin began running the Imperial Peiyang Women’s Medical School and Hospital in the northern Chinese city Tientsin, now called Tianjin. She later founded a nursing school in the city with funding from Yuan Shikai, a Qing dynasty official who would become president of the new Chinese republic after the 1911 revolution, said Zhou Zhuitian, a historian in Tianjin. Prusek wrote in his book that she also served as the physician for Yuan’s family. “She is the founder of nursing education in China — the pioneer, the trailblazer,” said Qian Gang, a Hong Kong-based historian. Kin returned to China for good in 1920, two years after her son, Alexander, died while fighting for the United States in France in the waning weeks of World War I. She died in 1934 at the age of 70, leaving no survivors. The cause was pneumonia. At her request, she was buried on a farm outside Beijing. “Here my dust will blend with soil,” she told Prusek, “and after the pile of clay they will place upon my grave has crumbled as well, I will become a field, a fertile field.” The land has since been swallowed by the city’s urban sprawl.

2018,Oxford Roiled by Invitation to Far-Right German Politician,"OXFORD, England — As right-wing leaders continue to rise globally, so too has the question of whether they should be heard on prestigious Western platforms. In September, under immense pressure, The New Yorker rescinded its invitation to Stephen K. Bannon, the right-wing populist and former chief strategist to President Trump, to speak at its annual festival. A similar controversy is unfolding at the University of Oxford, where the Oxford Union — the famed debate society — has invited Alice Weidel, the leader of the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, to speak next Wednesday. Ms. Weidel’s impending visit has prompted significant backlash. Oxford’s Student Union has voted to condemn the event, planning for a mass protest is underway, and an open letter calling for her invitation to be rescinded has garnered more than 100 signatures, including those of Oxford faculty members, local politicians and a member of Parliament. “This is a thoughtless and ill-advised invitation,” said Paul Betts, a professor of European history at St. Antony’s College, who signed the open letter. “Her party’s race-baiting, anti-Muslim politics has no place in a city which prides itself on its diversity and hostility to extremisms of all kinds.” Anneliese Dodds, who represents Oxford East in Parliament and signed the open letter, said in a news release that “the Oxford Union should be aware that this move will lessen its standing in our city as a venue for democratic debate and tolerance.” The AfD, little known just a few years ago, is now the third-largest political party in the German Parliament, and its support continues to surge. Last Sunday, nearly 13 percent of voters in Hesse, a German state, cast their ballots for the party, securing the AfD seats in all 16 of Germany’s state parliaments for the first time. Known for its anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant positions, Alternative for Deutschland has brought far-right views back into the German mainstream. In August, thousands of far-right marchers staged a violent protest in the German city of Chemnitz. Police largely stood by as demonstrators flashed Nazi salutes and threatened dark-skinned onlookers. Ms. Weidel, the party leader, has called Chancellor Angela Merkel “insane” and said that Germany “will be destroyed” because of her immigration policies. In 2015, Ms. Merkel admitted nearly one million refugees into Germany, a decision that contributed greatly to the rise of Europe’s far-right parties and began a steady decline in her political standing. With Ms. Weidel’s appearance at Oxford still a week away, some influential members of the Oxford community have come to the Union’s defense. “I take the classic liberal position that it’s better to have the open debate, have them be challenged, and then often that ends up demolishing and exposing their position much more effectively than anything else,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a European historian at St. Antony’s and one of the world’s leading public intellectuals. The hourlong event will include a brief speech by Ms. Weidel, 20 minutes of questioning by the Oxford Union’s president, Stephen Horvath, and 20 minutes of questioning by the audience. The Union has already contracted additional security for the event, Mr. Horvath said, and will consider canceling the event only if Ms. Weidel herself decides to withdraw or if the police instruct the Union to do so for security reasons. Mr. Garton Ash added that just as he supports hosting Ms. Weidel so long as she is “challenged rigorously,” he also supports community members who choose to protest the event. Already, more than 550 people have expressed interest online in attending a demonstration against Ms. Weidel’s appearance. Ian McKendrick, an officer of Stand Up Against Racism, one of the groups organizing Wednesday’s demonstration, said protesters would congregate outside the Oxford Union. Their goal, Mr. McKendrick said, is both to “demoralize racists” and “embarrass the Oxford Union” for extending such an irresponsible invitation. “Inviting her to speak was a gross mistake,” added Kate Douglas, an officer of Unite Against Fascism, another of the groups organizing the demonstration. “It’s giving her a platform. It’s making her views more mainstream and acceptable, and we know what will follow: race hate, racist attacks and the legitimization of racist views.” The United States has seen a similar debate about featuring incendiary figures on prominent platforms, including the Alt-Right leader Richard Spencer and Mr. Bannon. In September, when it was announced that Mr. Bannon would speak at The New Yorker’s annual ideas festival, other participants pulled out of the event. Under immense pressure, David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, withdrew Mr. Bannon’s invitation. “I’ve thought this through and talked to colleagues  —  and I’ve reconsidered. I’ve changed my mind. There is a better way to do this,” Mr. Remnick wrote in a memo to his staff. The leaders of the Oxford Union, however, say they have no intention of canceling Ms. Weidel’s speech. “We consider our invitations carefully. We firmly believe in free speech. That is not going to change because some student activists with very small mandates condemn us,” said Mr. Horvath, the group’s president. “We always seek to invite politicians in major European democracies who are gathering steam and have a certain degree of prominence.” Chris Patten, the chancellor of the University of Oxford, declined to comment on Ms. Weidel’s visit. A university spokeswoman, Julia Paolitto, noted only that the Oxford Union is an entirely independent organization and that, as a result, Oxford does not take a position on its speakers. This is not the first time the Oxford Union has ignited a debate over inviting right-wing leaders into its chambers. In 1999, on the advice of the police, the Union canceled a debate featuring John Tyndall, then the chairman of the far-right British National Party. And in 2007, hundreds protested a debate that included Nick Griffin, Tyndall’s successor as BNP chairman, and David Irving, a discredited historian. video",The New York Times
2018,"Ozone Park, Queens: A Congenial Area Welcomes a New Wave of Residents","Living in In the past decade, the neighborhood has seen a “tremendous transformation,” with new developments and an increasingly diverse population. 9 Photos View Slide Show › Last year, Yi Xu and her husband, Vail Gold, moved from Long Island City to Ozone Park. The couple had run across a Zillow listing for a $580,000 house with three bedrooms in the Queens neighborhood, which lies just east of Brooklyn and west of the Aqueduct Racetrack, four miles from John F. Kennedy International Airport. Ms. Xu, 30, a management consultant for a hospital, was born in China, and Mr. Gold, 31, a software developer, came from upstate New York. They hadn’t heard of Ozone Park, so they didn’t know that it was developed in the late 19th century, when “ozone” referred to the sea breezes from Jamaica Bay that supposedly swept away threats of malaria. Nor were they aware that John Gotti, the Gambino crime family boss who died in 2002, was its most notorious former denizen, with the Beat Generation novelist Jack Kerouac coming in maybe second. 1/2 mile forest park Ozone Park QUEENS South Richmond Hill Woodhaven 108TH ST. ATLANTIC AVE. Lalance & Grosjean factory clocktower Ozone Park ROCKAWAY BLVD. bayside cemetery CROSS BAY BLVD. tudor park Jack Kerouac’s House Resorts World Casino N. CONDUIT AVE. BrooKLYN Lindenwood By The New York Times But the price was right. They paid $560,000 for the newly renovated half of a semi-attached house in Tudor Village, a 1920s enclave with 388 dwellings and a 13.5-acre park. The couple intended to start a family, and they were impressed that three of the neighborhood’s public schools had a GreatSchools rating of 7 out of 10. “Nowhere else that we could afford anything was the rating above ‘poor,’” Mr. Gold said. Now they have a room for a baby, and another for Ms. Xu’s parents when they visit from Beijing. The couple use the garage for storage and park on the street, almost always in front of their door. Travel time to their jobs in Manhattan is between an hour and 90 minutes. Although planes skim low in the sky with regularity, they pose no real distraction, the couple said. An eclectic cohort is sweeping into Ozone Park like the original advertised breezes, finding space and opportunity in what residents describe as a safe, congenial neighborhood. And it is just the latest wave. First came Germans, Irish and Poles; then, Italians and more Italians. In recent decades, Ozone Park has attracted Hispanics, East Asians, South Asians and Indo-Caribbeans. Stoop talk is in a mixed bouquet of languages, and the homemade signs tacked to utility poles are as likely to be in Bengali as English. “Ozone Park, in the past 10 years, has undergone a tremendous transformation,” said Eric Ulrich, who was raised in the neighborhood and now represents it as a Republican member of the City Council. In the Centreville district, near the racetrack, for example, P.S. 337, a badly needed elementary school, opened last year on Raleigh Street, and a half-completed $50 million capital project will renovate streets, sidewalks and sewers. The upzoning of main streets like Rockaway Boulevard, 101st Avenue and Liberty Avenue has made way for mixed-used developments and increased retail activity. And the long-anticipated — and, for many, feared — Resorts World Casino New York City opened in 2011 at Aqueduct, attracting about 10 million visitors a year. Locals were concerned that the casino would exacerbate traffic snarls and drive down property values, but it has settled in comfortably. “They’re a really good neighbor,” said Joseph Caruana, the president of the Ozone Park Civic Association. The casino donates money and gifts to local charities and festivals, holds job fairs and employs a substantial slice of the community. Of the approximately 1,000 people who work for Resorts World in jobs like food service, maintenance and accounting, 62 percent live in the area and other parts of Queens, said Michelle Stoddart, the company’s director of public relations and community development. The casino is currently building a 400-room hotel with restaurants and shops that is expected to open in 2020. An influx of residents — Ozone Park’s population was estimated at 56,111 in 2016, an increase of 4 percent over the 2010 census — has brought typical urban side effects. There is a shortage of seats in the city’s universal prekindergarten program. Express bus lanes on Cross Bay Boulevard have smoothed commuting for some residents but contribute to traffic clogs at rush hour and eat up parking spaces near businesses. Noise from outdoor activities, like park gatherings, is a top 311 complaint. Even so, “it’s a great neighborhood,” Mr. Ulrich said. “Anyone who’s interested in coming here should get in on the ground floor now.” Single-family and two-family homes with stoops and enclosed front porches make up much of Ozone Park’s housing stock. Set closely on narrow lots, they are often embellished with Corinthian columns, rippling wood shingles, decorative brickwork or leaded-glass windows. White-picket, wrought-iron and chain-link fences enclose the tiny front yards, as do pink marble balustrades with finials shaped like globes or, sometimes, eagles. In Tudor Village to the southwest, the houses make heavy use of gables and red brick with chunks of rusticated stone. In the Liberty Heights neighborhood, to the north, they tend to be detached, single-family buildings whose higher prices reflect their proximity to the A train, which runs along Liberty Avenue. Condominiums can be found at Magnolia Court, a gated, 48-unit townhouse development that was built on the neighborhood’s southern border in 2004. Balsam Village is a 1975 apartment complex on Pitkin Avenue with 45 six-family buildings. Ozone Park’s main retail stretch is Cross Bay Boulevard, a broad, busy thoroughfare that runs from Atlantic Avenue and connects to the Belt Parkway. Notable establishments include Aldo’s Ozone Park, a pizzeria; Hana Asian Bistro; and Arepalicious, a restaurant run by a couple from Colombia. Businesses are also strung along Liberty Avenue, where Milk Farm Supermarket offers bins of yucca, ginger and Korean batata; and Rockaway Boulevard, the home of Enzo’s, another popular pizzeria. Nearby, on 97th Avenue, is Cherry Valley Marketplace, which sells groceries and beauty products. A Stop & Shop supermarket and a Petland Discounts can be found at Clocktower Plaza, on Atlantic Avenue; the A & S Italian Pork Store and M & O Bagels are just a couple of retail establishments on 101st Avenue. The two-acre Centreville Playground has baseball fields and basketball courts, plus a fence decorated with horses in tribute to the long-gone Centreville Racetrack, for which the park, and area, were named. Not far below Tudor Park, in the former Sunrise Stables in Howard Beach, is a branch of Gallop NYC, a therapeutic horseback riding program for adults and children with disabilities. The real estate company RealtyTrac reported that the median sales price of a nondistressed home in Ozone Park was $577,500 in July. Property values here have risen steadily, with prices increasing 4 percent over the past year. “I hate to predict the market going higher and higher and higher, because I feel we’re pretty much near the top,” said Jerry Fink, the owner of Jerry Fink Real Estate, which last year sold the Balsam Village development to a New York venture capital group for $39.5 million. “We have to see where interest rates go next year.” “It’s definitely a seller’s market,” said Carolyn De Falco, a broker associate with Keller Williams Realty Liberty, in Ozone Park. “As soon as something comes on the market, if it’s priced right and in good condition, it has an accepted offer in seven to 14 days.” As of Oct. 8, the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island had 102 area properties on its website, some pushing east of 108th Street. The least expensive was a three-bedroom, two-bathroom unit in a condominium development, priced at $356,000; the most expensive was a two-family brick building with a terra-cotta roof, priced at $1.569 million. Among Ozone Park’s suburban tendencies — low buildings, neighborliness, automobile worship — is its embrace of Halloween. By late September, pumpkins, ghouls and their warty, fanged companions were already decorating the lawns. Every year, with the neighbors’ encouragement, trick-or-treaters from surrounding areas descend on Tudor Village like vampires at a blood-sausage festival. “I sit outside for literally hours,” said Frank Dardani, the president of the 89-year-old Ozone Tudor Civic Association, describing his candy-distribution habits. “It doesn’t pay to walk back in the house, because the bell would be ringing constantly.” A fall festival is scheduled for Oct. 20 in Tudor Park, with crafts, face-painting, inflatables and a pumpkin patch. Founded in 2014, P.S. 316, Queens Explorers Magnet School for Global Conservation and Service Learning, enrolls about 400 students in prekindergarten through fourth grade. (The school will add fifth graders next year.) On 2018 state tests, 55 percent met standards in English, versus 45 percent districtwide; 71 percent met standards in math, versus 40 percent districtwide. P.S. 63, Old South, enrolls about 1,300 students in prekindergarten through fifth grade. On 2016-2017 state tests, 45 percent met standards in English, versus 38 percent districtwide; 57 percent met standards in math, versus 41 percent districtwide. P.S. 65, Raymond York Elementary School, enrolls about 470 students in kindergarten through fifth grade.

2018,Packers Beat 49ers on a Last-Second Field Goal,"Roundup Mason Crosby kicked a 27-yard field goal as time expired to cap an 81-yard drive set up by Kevin King’s interception with 1 minute 7 seconds left, and the Green Bay Packers outlasted the San Francisco 49ers for a 33-30 win on Monday night at Lambeau Field. The drive was extended after 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman was called for an illegal contact penalty on third-and-15 that wiped out a sack of Aaron Rodgers with 43 seconds left. Rodgers later rushed up the middle for a 21-yard gain. A two-time most valuable player, Rodgers then completed two more passes for 19 yards to set up Crosby’s game-winner for Green Bay (3-2-1). The veteran kicker was perfect a week after missing four field goals in a loss at Detroit. Rodgers threw for 425 yards and two scores. C.J. Beathard passed for 245 yards and two touchdowns for the 49ers (1-5). BILLS’ ALLEN OUT INDEFINITELY Josh Allen, the Buffalo Bills’ rookie quarterback, is out indefinitely after hurting his throwing arm. His absence leaves his team in a quandary. Without providing many details, Coach Sean McDermott listed Allen as being “week to week” on Monday, a day after Allen hurt his elbow in the third quarter of a 20-13 loss at Houston. McDermott said he would know more about the nature of Allen’s injury after meeting with team doctors. The injury to Allen, the Bills’ first-round draft pick, leaves McDermott having to decide between having the turnover-prone backup Nathan Peterman or the newly signed 12-year veteran Derek Anderson start in Buffalo’s game at Indianapolis on Sunday. McDermott wouldn’t provide a hint as to who would start in Allen’s place. Peterman threw two interceptions against the Texans, with his first returned for the deciding touchdown with 1 minute 23 seconds left in the game. Including a brief playoff appearance, Peterman, a second-year player, has been intercepted on 10 of his 82 career attempts. He is best remembered for throwing five interceptions in the first half of a 54-24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers last season. Anderson, 35, was signed only a week ago after spending the off-season away from football. He attempted only eight passes in three appearances with Carolina last season, and hasn’t started a game in nearly two years. BUCS FIRE COACH OF DEFENSE The Tampa Bay Buccaneers fired the defensive coordinator Mike Smith and replaced him with the linebackers coach Mark Duffner. The move came a day after the team’s third straight loss following a 2-0 start and two weeks after Coach Dirk Koetter said he had no intentions of dismissing Smith because the Bucs’ defensive woes were not the fault of any one person. JETS ASSISTANT TO RETURN Kacy Rodgers, the Jets’ defensive coordinator, will return to work this week after missing the past two games while dealing with an illness. Coach Todd Bowles said that Rodgers would coach Sunday in the Jets’ game against Minnesota. Bowles has run the defense the past two weeks, victories over Denver and Indianapolis. Rodgers, 49, has been dealing with an unspecified illness that Bowles has characterized as “serious.” BEER-THROWING FAN IS CHARGED The police in Foxborough, Mass., charged a Gillette Stadium fan who threw beer onto Kansas City Chiefs wideout Tyreek Hill on Sunday with disorderly conduct and throwing an object at a sporting event. The New England Patriots announced earlier Monday that they had identified the fan, barred him from their stadium and turned the matter over to law enforcement. (FIELD LEVEL MEDI",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Packing the Supreme Court Is a Terrible Idea ,"Democrats paid a political cost for decades after F.D.R. tried it in the 1930s. They probably would again. Mr. Zelizer is a co-author of the forthcoming “Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974.” Packing the Supreme Court is back in the news. Frustrated with the rightward drift of the courts under President Trump, a growing number of liberals are contemplating the possibility of expanding the size of the Supreme Court should they regain power in 2020. Liberals are considering the bold step because, they argue, the rightward shift in the judiciary has been obtained by a president operating under a cloud of illegitimacy and with the benefit of minority rule in the Senate. But the political risks for such a move by Democrats would be enormous, and potentially long-lasting. An expansion of the Supreme Court is possible: The Constitution does not specify the number of justices who should serve. Even if Democrats fail in passing legislation to expand the court, proponents argue, the effort would still have a salutary effect by pressuring Chief Justice John Roberts to moderate his colleagues toward the center. For precedent, they point to a similar move by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After a Democratic landslide victory in 1936, Roosevelt tried to tame the Supreme Court. In his first term, the Democratic Congress had enacted a sweeping New Deal agenda that included economic regulations, protections for organized labor, public works spending and social safety net policies. But the Supreme Court ruled against two major programs — the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Eager to take advantage of the election results, he proposed legislation that would allow the president to appoint an additional justice, up to a maximum of six, for every member of the court who was over age 70. The proposal immediately triggered a political backlash. Conservatives were up in arms. They spoke of a “dictatorship” under Roosevelt, who they said was trying to achieve a “bloodless coup d’état.” Senator Josiah Bailey of North Carolina warned in a national radio address that the Supreme Court and the Constitution were under threat: “To weaken either is to weaken the foundations of our Republic. To destroy either is to destroy the Republic.” After several weeks of deliberation, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10 to 8 to send the bill to the floor with a negative recommendation. “The bill is an invasion of judicial power such as has never before been attempted in this country,” the majority stated upon sending its recommendation to the floor. Polls revealed that a majority of Americans consistently opposed the plan. As debate on the legislation continued in the Senate, the court changed its tone by delivering favorable rulings for New Deal programs. There had in fact been earlier decisions that indicated a changing outlook on the court. Many Democrats believed, after the new decisions, that the pressure had worked, even though the Senate had shelved the bill in July: “The switch in time that saved nine” was how the president’s supporters described what we might call a flip-flop by Justice Owen Roberts, who voted in favor of a New Deal program in 1937 after having sided with the conservative “four horsemen of the court.” Roosevelt later concluded, “We obtained 98 percent of all the objectives intended by the court plan.” But the benefits of the move also came, critically, with enormous political costs that liberals would pay for almost four decades. The president handed conservatives an issue to paint him as a sort of American dictator. “The whole New Deal really went up in smoke as a result of the Supreme Court fight,” said Secretary of Agriculture and future Vice President Henry Wallace. The plan became a key talking point to foment a fierce political backlash against the F.D.R. and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. One constituent sent a senator a bullet wrapped in a paper that warned, “If you support Roosevelt’s court bill, we will get you — you dirty rubber stamp.” The court battle was a huge reversal of fortune for Roosevelt. Starting with the 1938 midterm elections, a coalition of Southern Democratic committee chairmen and Republicans came to power. They broke with the president by forming a powerful congressional voting bloc that had the muscle to stifle major initiatives at the high point of the liberal era. Health care and civil rights legislation, for instance, were two issues that the coalition held hostage. Southern committee chairmen worked with ranking Republicans to prevent legislation from ever reaching the floor. Senator James Eastland of Mississippi joked about special pockets that he had put into his pants to carry around the civil rights bills that he never allowed to come up for a vote. When bills did reach the Senate, the coalition joined forces to filibuster. The columnist William White called the Senate the “South’s unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg.” The only real break for liberals finally came in 1964 and 1965, when an enormous grass-roots civil rights movement and huge Democratic majorities put into office during the 1964 election gave President Lyndon Johnson a brief window to pass Great Society legislation — a window that largely closed with the midterms in 1966. Ultimately, the conservative coalition that was born out of Roosevelt’s court-packing battles came apart only when congressional reforms in the mid-1970s brought the committee era to an end. If Democrats place their bets on court-packing once again, the political backlash would probably be even more severe. The right now possesses huge institutional weapons — national news media outlets, well-established interest groups and think tanks, and vast sources of campaign money — that could quickly be deployed. They have invested heavily in reshaping the courts over the past few decades. Given that the Republicans have tended to care about the courts more than liberals, it is likely that court packing could be more effective at energizing Republicans than Democrats. Even if there is a Democratic Congress before 2020, proponents will never find the two-thirds support needed to overturn a presidential veto. If liberals want to change the direction of the courts, they should do more to replicate the kind of long-term projects their opponents have undertaken since the 1980s to nurture judicial talent and create a deep pool for future appointments. Liberals need to do better at using congressional procedure and handling open hearings to diminish political support for conservative nominees — and obviously they need to win elections, starting in November. Liberals must realize that without doing more to build effective grass-roots political campaigns in the home states of swing senators, the political logic of partisanship will rarely result in so-called moderates acting in “moderate” ways. As much as liberals yearn for a dramatic plan like court packing that might in the near term break the lock that the right has on the judiciary, it would in the end strengthen the political forces fighting to dismantle voting rights, gun control, environmental regulation, abortion rights and the legacies of the New Deal and the Great Society.

2018,Painting Shows Trump Hanging Out With Lincoln and Nixon. He Loves It.,"Finally, a portrait of President Trump that he actually liked. In a framed image captured in the background of a “60 Minutes” interview at the White House, Mr. Trump sits among Republican presidents from the past century and a half, looking as if he had just made a wisecrack that drew laughter from the likes of Abraham Lincoln and Richard Nixon. This depiction of Mr. Trump boasts a lean physique and flashy smile. His dazzling white shirt and bold red tie make him the undeniable focal point of the scene. Andy Thomas, the 61-year-old artist behind the work, said he received a call a few weeks ago from Mr. Trump, who expressed his delight with the painting. He had received a large print as a gift from Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California. “One thing he specifically mentioned was he didn’t usually like portraits of himself,” Mr. Thomas said Tuesday. “But he said that he really liked that one.” After viewers spotted the whimsical painting on Sunday, when the interview aired, the image and the artist behind it received the burst of news reports and memes that are part of internet life these days. Mr. Issa, who considers Mr. Thomas a friend, gave Mr. Trump the framed print this past summer, the congressman’s spokesman said. Mr. Issa has two of Mr. Thomas’s paintings featured in his own office. In the painting on Mr. Trump’s wall, titled “The Republican Club,” the president — drinking a Diet Coke — sits with a gaggle of past presidents at a private club. Ronald Reagan smiles broadly. Theodore Roosevelt puts his foot on a chair as if he’s in a Wild West saloon. Even Richard Nixon, who resigned in shame, gets a seat and a full glass of red wine. Mr. Thomas, from Carthage, Mo., said he likes to polish the appearance of his subjects, while still making them look like themselves. Although he was hesitant to speculate on Mr. Trump’s psychology around the painting, he said he expects that the president appreciated holding court with the likes of Lincoln. (Mr. Trump has compared himself to Lincoln in the past.) Perhaps it made Mr. Trump feel a part of a special clique. “When they first get there, they probably don’t feel like they belong,” Mr. Thomas said. The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the painting. Although he leans libertarian, Mr. Thomas said he supports Mr. Trump. But his work doesn’t focus exclusively on Republicans. Aside from three paintings of Republican presidents across history, he has created images of Democratic presidents acting chummy as well. In “The Democratic Club,” Mr. Thomas painted Barack Obama with a tall glass of beer, sitting among a polo-clad John F. Kennedy, a cigarette-smoking Franklin D. Roosevelt and other Democrats of White Houses past. Cara A. Finnegan, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois who studies the history of photography and presidential portraiture, said the painting reminded her of other popular prints that use the images of past presidents to bolster the reputations of contemporary ones. For example, an 1866 print created after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln depicts him being greeted by George Washington as he ascends into heaven. “The idea is associating the current presidents with mythical presidents of the past,” Ms. Finnegan said. And a 1902 stereograph, a popular form of photography of the era that gave a three-dimensional effect, shows two girls praying over the portraits of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield and William McKinley, all victims of assassins. The picture was titled, “The Martyred Presidents.” Another part of the attraction of seeing past presidents side by side, Ms. Finnegan said, is the image of presidential camaraderie. Just recently, a photograph went viral of the living former presidents at Barbara Bush’s funeral, along with their spouses. Mr. Trump did not attend. Paul Staiti, a professor of fine arts at Mount Holyoke College, compared Mr. Thomas’s painting to the famed series of dogs playing poker by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge. In fact, in two other past paintings of Republicans and Democrats, the former presidents were doing just that. While it may seem that only some presidents are featured in the painting, Mr. Thomas said that all the Republican presidents in history are squeezed into the frame. Some, like Calvin Coolidge, gaze at the elite group from the background. Also in the background, Mr. Thomas painted a slightly blurred image of a woman walking toward the table of male politicians. He imagined that as the first Republican woman president, confidently striding over to the boys’ club and asserting herself. (He painted a similar female figure in the Democratic picture.) The media limelight has been harsh this week, bringing a flood of internet criticism that he said he found meanspirited. Mr. Thomas said he never claimed his art was “high brow.” On the positive side, people are ordering his prints like crazy.",The New York Times
2018,Pakistan Opposition Leader Is Arrested on Corruption Charges,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The opposition leader in the Pakistani parliament, who is also the younger brother of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was arrested on Friday by anticorruption authorities, officials said. Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, the leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, was arrested by officials of the National Accountability Bureau in the eastern city of Lahore and will appear in court on Saturday, officials said. He is accused of corruption in a low-cost housing scheme that was introduced in Punjab during his time as chief minister in the province. The arrest is the latest setback for the Sharif family, which has been dogged by allegations of widespread graft and malfeasance. This year, Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, were arrested and sent to prison over corruption-related charges. They were released on bail last month after a high court suspended their sentences. Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif was made the standard-bearer of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz by his elder brother in July 2017, and he was officially elected party leader in March. The courts have disqualified Nawaz Sharif from heading a political party or holding public office. The younger Sharif had developed a reputation for his administrative skills and for overseeing several high-profile infrastructure projects. However, he has also been the focus of several corruption investigations. Both brothers deny the graft allegations, characterizing the claims as politically motivated, and Nawaz Sharif has accused the country’s powerful military of pushing the investigations. The former prime minister’s contentious relationship with the armed forces began shortly after he took office in 2013. The military, which has ruled Pakistan through various coups for about half of the country’s history, denies any political involvement. Prime Minister Imran Khan, who came to power in general elections in July, made fighting corruption a centerpiece of his campaign and promised ruthless accountability. Mr. Khan has accused Mr. Sharif, the former prime minister, of running a “criminal syndicate,” and he holds the Sharif family to blame for the country’s abysmal economic condition. “Those people who have looted the country, I promise that they will be brought to justice,” Mr. Khan said in a speech soon after his election victory in August. Allies of Mr. Khan welcomed Friday’s detention. “This is the first arrest,” Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, the Pakistani information minister, said, according to state-run news media. “More arrests will follow.” But members of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party condemned the development as political victimization. “These tactics are not new,” the party said in a statement. “China and Turkey have praised Shehbaz Sharif for his work. But he has been arrested on trumped-up charges.” The praise from Beijing is largely the result of Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif promoting the speedy completion of several infrastructure projects with Chinese companies in Punjab. The timing of the arrest is significant because it comes before by-elections for 11 parliamentary seats and 19 provincial assembly seats on Oct. 14. The results are seen as a litmus test of the elder Mr. Sharif’s enduring popularity and will also offer an early appraisal of Mr. Khan’s new government. OpinionAbbas Nasir",The New York Times
2018,Pakistan Seeks I.M.F. Bailout as Government Sends Mixed Messages,"NEW DELHI — After Pakistan’s government signaled that it would seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, Prime Minister Imran Khan this week did the exact opposite of the austerity measures the global body is demanding: He inaugurated a public-housing project to deliver five million homes. That tension — between Mr. Khan’s campaign promises to build the social welfare state and the prescriptions to help set Pakistan’s devastated economy right — is leaving investors at home and internationally guessing about the policies he truly intends to pursue. But investors typically detest such uncertainty and responded this week by offloading the Pakistani rupee, which hit a historic low, while hammering the stock market with a sell-off, wiping $2 billion off the index’s value. There is only more uncertainty ahead. On Thursday, the Pakistani government formally began the process of seeking an I.M.F. bailout worth up to $12 billion. But analysts say the country’s financing gap may be as high as $20 billion, leaving investors worried that the government may not ask the fund for a robust-enough package while continuing to ask China and Saudi Arabia for more loans, after taking several billions of dollars worth of loans from Beijing this year alone. The concern surrounding Pakistan’s economic course and Mr. Khan’s intentions has clearly left the I.M.F. skeptical, and the result may be a tough road ahead for the country if it is to get its bailout. The fund’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, insisted on Thursday that Pakistan provide “absolute transparency” on its debts, many of which are owed to China as part of its Belt and Road construction program. Pakistan is a showcase for China’s initiative, hosting up to $62 billion of Chinese investments, most financed by costly loans taken from Chinese state-owned banks. Any bailout for Pakistan would require “complete understanding and absolute transparency about the nature, size, and terms of the debt that is bearing on a particular country,” Ms. Lagarde said, as she prepared to meet the Pakistani delegation later Thursday at the I.M.F. and World Bank Group annual meetings in Bali, Indonesia. Later that day, the I.M.F. released a statement saying that Ms. Lagarde had met the Pakistani team and that the fund would send a team to Islamabad in the coming weeks to initiate discussions for a bailout program. Ahead of Pakistan’s July elections, Mr. Khan promised to open up the books on Chinese investments and even cut projects that were unnecessary or too costly. Pakistan’s previous government, led by ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was harshly criticized for refusing to publicly disclose the financing terms and conditions around China’s investments, leaving the country in the dark about exactly how much debt it has committed to repay. Critics of the previous Pakistani government, including Mr. Khan, accuse it of doing a poor job negotiating the Chinese loans and say that the costs were often inflated, leaving Pakistan with a debt load it will struggle to repay. But since coming to office in August, Mr. Khan has not opened the books, perhaps because of pressure from China, officials say. The United States has accused Beijing of using “debt trap diplomacy” to load up countries with debt in order to secure political and military demands, a charge China’s government denies. Although Pakistan faces an external debt burden of $8 billion this year, the first payments to China as part of the Belt and Road Initiative come due in 2019, with $1 billion owed, officials say. Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves hit a four-year low last week, hovering at $8.4 billion according to the central bank. That is less than enough to cover even just two months of imports. “Going to the I.M.F. was inevitable. There was no other way out, not only to bridge the financing gap but to provide confidence to the markets,” said Farrukh Saleem, the spokesman for Pakistan’s Ministry of Economy. He added: “Even if China had given $26 billion to Pakistan, it doesn’t give confidence to the markets. It’s not just about the bailout but getting into an I.M.F. monitoring program,” which gives investors assurance that Pakistan is taking on needed economic reforms, allowing the country to tap other debt markets. Although Mr. Khan maintains that he will pursue both the I.M.F. bailout and loans from “friendly countries,” those statements contradict the stance of both his finance minister and information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, who said that the conditions on those outside loans were unacceptable. “We spoke with the United Arab Emirates, China, Saudi Arabia and held consultations with other countries,” Mr. Chaudhry said in televised remarks Tuesday. “We did not want to take the money the way it was being given to us.” The information minister did not explain what the conditions were. But Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have in the past requested that Pakistan join their war in Yemen, which has bogged down those countries financially while creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises as Yemeni civilians are killed by bombing and starvation. On the campaign trail before the July elections, Mr. Khan championed austerity even as he promised to build an Islamic welfare state. The new project to build five million housing units is a signature part of his “Naya Pakistan” agenda — meaning New Pakistan — to kick-start the economy and provide support to the country’s poorest. But going to the I.M.F. will likely mean cuts to those welfare state dreams. “With the I.M.F., there will be an impact on the government not fulfilling its election promises. But welcome to the real world,” said Mr. Saleem, the economy ministry spokesman. The contradicting remarks coming out of Islamabad have left investors confused about how seriously Mr. Khan’s government will commit to the I.M.F.’s austerity terms. This would be the latest in at least 12 I.M.F. programs Pakistan has undertaken in the last few decades, failing to complete the structural reforms required in all but one bailout package. “This crisis could have been averted better if the government had declared their plan two months ago, when they came to power. Instead they gave mixed messages, leaving the markets guessing. A lot of damage could have been averted with timely clarity,” said Ashraf Wathra, the former central bank governor under the previous government. While Mr. Wathra acknowledges that the previous government is at fault for the ballooning national debt, he says Mr. Khan should have taken the overwhelming advice from economists to go to the I.M.F. as soon as possible. This week, the Pakistani rupee fell as low as 137 to the United States dollar, shedding 10.2 percent of its value. The biggest ever one-day fall was in 1998, when the rupee fell 11 percent after Pakistan tested nuclear weapons. Pakistan’s business community, and even ardent supporters of Mr. Khan’s party, have also been angry at what many described as “dithering” ahead of the decision to go to the I.M.F. Farooq Sarwar, a Rawalpindi-based importer of food, toiletries and confectionary items, has said he has had to cut down on his stock, worried stores he supplies will close down as customers cut their spending as the rupee falls in value. “The dip in the dollar has affected the importers in a way that no one knows what to do right now,” Mr. Sarwar said. “We had high expectations from the current government and thought they will take steps after taking people in to confidence. But it seems they had done no homework.”",The New York Times
2018,Pakistan Tries a New Way to Pay for a Dam: Crowdsourcing,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pav Akhtar is not one to fall for TV donation ads. In fact, he says, he and his siblings jokingly chide their mother for watching them on Pakistani satellite channels at their home in Lancashire, England. But when he saw the call on a Pakistani news show for overseas Pakistanis to donate to a new fund-raising initiative, he wired his money without hesitation. “It’s not a generic begging bowl,” said Mr. Akhtar, 40. “It’s a specific demand for a specific outcome, and that motivates me.” Mr. Akhtar was not donating to a charity, though. He was giving money to the government. The financially challenged Pakistani state is running a crowdsourcing-style campaign in a last-ditch effort to secure $14 billion to build two dams, which officials say will solve the country’s endemic shortages of water and electricity. It has become the cause du jour for Pakistanis both at home and abroad. Television news shows regularly feature the day’s biggest donors handing over their paychecks en masse, including the national soccer team, Pakistani politicians, government employees and members of the military. Radio ads across the country implore average citizens to donate even 10 rupees (less than 10 cents) over the phone. Pakistani celebrities have announced their own hefty donations on social media and made fund-raising appeals to their fans. This week, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who created the fund, berated the television channel Geo News in the Supreme Court for not donating “a single penny” to the dam project. “Did Geo group hold a marathon transmission for dam funds?” he said. “Geo has not taken the lead over the dam issue even though it is the biggest of all channels.” To allow for smoother overseas money transfers, the State Bank of Pakistan has even authorized the use of a service owned by PayPal, potentially opening the way for PayPal itself to enter one of the few countries where it is banned. That new openness reflects the gravity of Pakistan’s financial situation as the government grasps for funding wherever it can. The country faces a balance-of-payments crisis, with a record $18 billion current account deficit for the last fiscal year. On Tuesday, Pakistan announced that it had secured a $6 billion assistance package from Saudi Arabia to help with the crisis. About half the assistance will be deposited at Pakistan’s central bank, to shore up the country’s dwindling finances — it has only enough cash left to cover about two months of imports — while the remaining $3 billion will be a deferred oil payment owed to the Saudis in three years. With Pakistan still discussing a possible multibillion-dollar bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the Saudi assistance is likely to lower the amount requested. And Pakistan has already received several billion dollars in emergency loans this year from China, its major regional ally. Other doors were closed this year when the United States froze aid and Pakistan was returned to an international financial “gray list,” in both cases over concerns that Pakistan was not doing enough to combat terrorist groups operating on its soil. With few options left, the government is going directly to the people. The dam project would seem an unlikely way to galvanize Pakistanis, who in recent years have grown weary of corruption scandals and crumbling public services. Construction of the dams has yet to begin, and even the most optimistic estimates say they won’t be functional for at least a decade. But Imran Khan, the new prime minister, is no stranger to fund-raising or sunny rhetoric. He spent years in the 1980s and ’90s raising money to build a world-class cancer hospital for the poor in Lahore, which he often cites as proof of his resolve. “I am the greatest fund-raiser in the history of Pakistan,” he said last month. “We can build dams in five years if the donations continue.” Mr. Khan and his government have created a sense of urgency around the project, known as the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand Dams, spawning social media discussions and news debates that cast the dams as pivotal for Pakistan’s future. On Sept. 8, Mr. Khan appealed on television to the nine million Pakistanis living abroad, asking them to give at least $1,000 each. As of Oct. 8, they had donated about $3 million, including more than $300,000 from the United States. That is a small fraction of the $48 million raised since the government opened a bank account for donations in July, which itself is less than 1 percent of the dams’ total estimated cost of $14 billion. A Pakistani television network noted last month that at the current rate, funding the dam would take 120 years. Foreign lenders could speed up the process, but many of them, like the World Bank and the Asian Development Fund, have been reluctant to participate, despite more than a decade of campaigning by previous governments. Minor pledges from allies like Japan haven’t been enough to close the gap. China sought to fund the dams as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, its $62 billion plan to invest in Pakistani infrastructure in exchange for securing new trade routes. But its onerous terms, under which the Chinese would essentially own the dams themselves, kept Pakistan from including the dam project in the broader deal. Though the move signaled Pakistan’s growing concern over its indebtedness to China, it means the dam project has no major foreign lender. Without such backing, the full $14 billion needed to complete it is woefully out of reach. But critics say that even if the money is raised, the dams won’t be the silver bullet the Pakistani government would have donors believe. “Because the dams are a big project, there’s been a lot of hype created around it and people in the government want to get some political mileage from it,” said Hassan Abbas, a hydrologist who has worked to address water shortages in Pakistan for more than two decades. Mr. Abbas said Pakistan’s water shortages stemmed from the outdated irrigation system left over from the British colonizers, which in many areas is more than 100 years old. An expensive dam project can’t fix the problem when it lies downstream, he said. The repeated calls to donate, though, drill home the same message: Pakistan needs the dams to survive. “In the public perception, these things count,” Mr. Abbas said. “You hear something again and again, the idea sticks: ‘If the dam isn’t made, we’ll die.’” As for the donors — average citizens and Pakistanis abroad who have handed over their money without stipulations — the unlikelihood of the project’s success isn’t a deterrent. Mr. Akhtar, the donor in Lancashire, England, said he did not regret his decision. Endlessly debating the merits of the dams will only leave Pakistan where it has always been, he said: “It’s like arguing while Rome burns.”",The New York Times
2018,Pakistani Court Acquits Christian Woman in Capital Blasphemy Case,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — She has been isolated on death row for eight years after an accusation with little evidence that she had spoken against the Prophet Muhammad. A prominent governor who spoke out in her defense was killed by his own bodyguard, and mobs have rallied against the suggestion that leniency might be in order. But for the first time since her arrest in 2009, Asia Bibi, the Christian Pakistani woman whose blasphemy conviction the following year rallied international condemnation of a law that has inspired violence again and again, is free. Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Wednesday fully acquitted her and ordered her “released forthwith,” in an exceptionally rare ruling against a blasphemy verdict. The ruling, by a three-member bench of the court, was announced by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar. “This is a landmark verdict,” said Omar Waraich, the deputy South Asia director at Amnesty International. “Despite her protest of innocence, and despite the lack of evidence against her, this case was used to rouse angry mobs, justify the assassinations of two senior officials, and intimidate the Pakistani state into capitulation. Justice has finally prevailed.” Mr. Waraich added, “The message must go out that the blasphemy laws will no longer be used to persecute the country’s most vulnerable minorities.” But given the realities in Pakistan, where last year a mob lynched a student on just the rumor that he had committed blasphemy, Ms. Bibi is likely to spend the rest of her life as a marked woman. The country braced for violence after the verdict was announced. Protests erupted in several cities, mostly by supporters of Tehreek-e-Labbaik, the religious party of the firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi. Pir Muhammad Afzal Qadri, one of the leaders of Tehreek-e-Labaik, told supporters in Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province, that the three justices who delivered the verdict were risking death. He also called for the removal of the Pakistan army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa. Protesters in Islamabad blocked one of the main highways that connect the capital to the neighboring city of Rawalpindi. They also burned tires and chanted slogans against the decision. In the southern port city of Karachi, hundreds of members of Tehreek-e-Labbaik disrupted traffic at intersections. “They’ve made a mockery of Islam with this verdict, and we will hold them accountable,” said a protester, Saqib Ali, 30. “Her freedom means all others who want to say anything against Islam know they will be protected by the courts.” Protests also broke out in smaller cities across Punjab. On Wednesday night, Prime Minister Imran Khan briefly addressed the nation, urging people not to be provoked by a “small section of society” and saying his government would not tolerate disruption of normal life. “Do not take the state to a point where it has no option but to take action,” Mr. Khan said, addressing protesters. Ms. Bibi’s case has drawn worldwide condemnation and calls for overturning Pakistan’s blasphemy law, which in effect has been used by extremists as a bludgeon against religious minorities. Ms. Bibi, a former farmworker in her early 50s who has five children, found herself at the center of the issue in June 2009 in Ittan Wali, a dusty farming village. On a hot summer day, Ms. Bibi had gone to pick berries with her Muslim co-workers. She brought water for them on the orders of a local landlord, but the Muslim women refused to touch the water bowl. A bitter argument ensued, each side presenting a different version of the verbal exchange. Muslims said Ms. Bibi had uttered vile abuses against Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. Ms. Bibi insisted she had not and that she was the victim of false accusations prompted by bigotry. She was dragged to a local police station and charged with blasphemy, and until Wednesday remained in jail. Blasphemy remains a highly combustible issue in Pakistan. Mere allegations can set off spasms of violence and mass riots. Several religious parties have used it to flex their muscles. The blasphemy law prescribes a death sentence for anyone convicted of insulting Islam or the Prophet Muhammad. But critics say the law has been mostly misused, often to settle personal vendettas and property disputes. Religious minorities are especially vulnerable to such accusations, and people who have advocated for changes in the blasphemy law have met with violence. In 2011, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab Province and an outspoken secular politician who had campaigned for Ms. Bibi’s release and changes in the country’s blasphemy laws, was shot and killed by his police bodyguard outside a cafe in an upscale area of Islamabad. Two months later, Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister of minorities and the only Christian cabinet minister in the Pakistani government, was shot and killed outside his home in Islamabad after he also called for changes to the blasphemy law. “Today has wiped away so much pain. It marks a beautiful end to a senseless and horrific saga,” Shehrbano Taseer, Mr. Taseer’s daughter, said in an interview after Ms. Bibi was acquitted. “It’s a victory for my father, Salmaan Taseer, and for Shahbaz Bhatti, who sacrificed their lives fighting for this cause,” she said. “All the brave men and women who have stuck to their beliefs every day, raising funds and raising awareness for Asia Bibi, protesting her case in the media and on the roads, speaking her truth in courts and in private conversations — they’ve had a pivotal role to play in today’s landmark judgment too.” Ms. Taseer added, “Today is a day to celebrate courage and humanity, patience and justice. It’s a day to remember the true essence of Islam. And it’s a day to remember that against all odds, we must continue to raise our voices for what is right.”",The New York Times
2018,Palestinian Kills 2 Israelis in West Bank Attack,"JERUSALEM — A Palestinian man fatally shot two Israeli co-workers and injured a third in an Israeli-run factory in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, an attack that Israeli officials described as terrorism. The killings shattered the calm in an industrial park long praised by Israelis as a symbol of peaceful coexistence. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, praised the attack without taking responsibility for it, calling it a “heroic operation.” Hamas said the shooting had been a “natural response to the crimes of the Israeli occupation against the rights of our people, in all the Palestinian lands.” The Islamic Jihad group in Gaza also praised the attack. The gunman, identified by the Israeli authorities only as Ashraf Naalwa, 23, a resident of the West Bank, was captured on security cameras fleeing the scene. Mr. Naalwa, an electrician, had not shown up for work in recent days and might have harbored grievances against his employers, according to other workers in the industrial park, near the settlements of Barkan and Ariel in the central West Bank. The Israeli military and the Israeli security agency known as Shin Bet said they had determined the assault was a terrorist attack, while allowing that the assailant may also have had personal motives. The Israeli authorities pointed to a message on Facebook that the suspect had apparently posted before the attack as one indication that he was not out only for personal vengeance. According to the Israeli news media, he suggested in the post that he had been called by Allah. “This was not only an attack on innocent people going about their daily lives,” President Reuven Rivlin of Israel said in a statement. “It was also an attack on the possibility of Israelis and Palestinians coexisting peacefully.” Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military, described the suspect as “armed and considered dangerous,” and said the military was searching for him and taking measures to prevent further attacks. The Israelis who were killed were identified as Kim Levengrond Yehezkel, 28, a secretary, and Ziv Hagbi, 35, an accountant. Both worked for the Alon Group, a company producing waste management systems. The name of the third victim was not released. Unlike Gaza, where Israeli forces have killed scores of Palestinians during often-violent protests along the border fence in recent months, the West Bank has remained relatively calm. Analysts have warned of a spillover of tensions, however. Israeli forces shot and killed three Palestinians on Friday, including Fares Hafez al-Sersawi, a 12-year-old boy, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Last month, a Palestinian teenager fatally stabbed Ari Fuld, a resident of the West Bank settlement of Efrat, at the Gush Etzion shopping center. Mr. Fuld, who was well known for his pro-Israel advocacy, was hailed as a hero by many Israelis for possibly helping to save other lives after security cameras showed him chasing and shooting at his assailant after being stabbed in the back. Colonel Conricus said that the assailant on Sunday appeared to have acted alone, operating without the backing of any known organization, and that he had been armed with an improvised weapon known as a Carlo. Named after the Swedish-made Carl Gustav submachine gun from the 1950s, Carlos are sometimes adapted from air guns in West Bank workshops. The West Bank settlements, constructed in territory that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, and which the Palestinians envision as part of their state, are considered a violation of international law by most of the world. But many Israelis, particularly the settler leadership, hold up the Barkan industrial park, where the attack took place on Sunday, as a model of cooperation and an important source of employment for thousands of Palestinians, who work in more than 150 factories and firms alongside an equal number of Israelis for equal salaries. Moshe Lev-Ran, an export manager at Twitto Plus, a company specializing in air-conditioning accessories and whose factory is next to the site of the attack, told reporters that the Palestinian employees “come happily to work because we provide them with a future and food.” Describing annual company fun days and barbecues, he added, “I call it the island of peace.”",The New York Times
2018,Palestinian Leaders Are Accused of Using Torture and Arbitrary Arrests to Crush Dissent,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — A West Bank journalist was detained by Palestinian Authority security forces for four days after he took photographs on his cellphone of the Palestinian prime minister’s convoy stuck in line at an Israeli-controlled checkpoint. An activist in Gaza said that Hamas security forces detained him for 15 days after he wrote a Facebook post protesting the lack of electricity in which he asked the group’s leaders if their children slept on the tiled floor to escape the heat, as his did. Citing those cases and others in a report published on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch, the New York-based advocacy organization, accused both the Western-backed Palestinian Authority and its rival, Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, of routinely using arbitrary arrest and torture as tools to crush dissent. The systematic practice of torture by the two authorities might amount to a crime against humanity and could be prosecutable at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, the report said. On Tuesday, spokesmen for the internal security forces of both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas dismissed the group’s report as biased and inaccurate. Adnan Damiri, a Palestinian Authority spokesman, said the report was “highly biased and full of mistaken information.” In an annex to the report, the security agencies of both Palestinian territories argued that abuses occurred only in isolated cases where perpetrators were investigated and held to account. Human Rights Watch said the evidence it had collected contradicted those claims. Speaking at a news conference in Ramallah, Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch and the lead researcher on the report, said: “Abuses happen. When abuses happen, those who carry them out should be held responsible. When you have impunity, abuse continues. There has been impunity for a quarter of a century.” Tom Porteous, deputy program director at Human Rights Watch, said that 25 years after the Oslo peace accord, “Palestinian authorities have gained only limited power in the West Bank and Gaza, but yet, where they have autonomy, they have developed parallel police states.” “Calls by Palestinian officials to safeguard Palestinian rights ring hollow as they crush dissent,” he added. Many of the accusations are not new. Human Rights Watch drew attention to what it called the “perilous state of human rights in the Palestinian self-rule areas” in a report on both Israeli and Palestinian violations in 1995. Journalists and rights organizations have documented many cases since. But the 149-page report published on Tuesday, which was two years in the making, drew on testimony from more than 140 witnesses, including former detainees, their relatives and lawyers, and it also reviewed medical records and court documents. Human Rights Watch detailed more than two dozen cases of people who it said were “detained for no clear reason beyond writing a critical article or Facebook post or belonging to the wrong student group or political movement.” The detentions often lasted for days or weeks, and the purpose of the authorities’ actions, the advocacy group said, was to punish critics and deter further activism. Human Rights Watch also pointed to systematic abuse including beatings, foot-whipping and, in particular, a form of torture known as “shabeh” in Arabic, in which detainees are contorted for long periods into stress positions that cause pain but rarely leave marks. Human Rights Watch called on countries that provide assistance to the various security agencies accused of such abuse to suspend that part of their aid. Palestinian analysts have long noted the increasing autocracy of the octogenarian Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in his struggle to suppress real and perceived rivals, and the competition between his Fatah-led Palestinian Authority and Hamas has led to waves of tit-for-tat arrests. In Ramallah, some Palestinians asked about the authority said that they did not dare speak publicly, making a snatching motion with their fingers to suggest that expressing criticism could lead them to be whisked off the street. Unauthorized protests have been brutally broken up. In Hamas-run Gaza, the authorities have long been accused of intimidating journalists and critics. In response to questions posed by Human Rights Watch, one of the West Bank security agencies, the Preventive Security Service, said that 220 Palestinians had been detained following posts on social media because they “fell outside the bounds of criticism and expression of opinion,” and could have “endangered the lives of citizens.” Jihad Barakat, the West Bank journalist who took the photographs of the Palestinian prime minister, was ultimately acquitted of any improper or unlawful behavior by a court in Ramallah. Amer Balousha, the activist in Gaza who complained about the heat, was first summoned on suspicion of incitement after calling on people to demonstrate and was later released. He was then arrested on another, unspecified charge “of a criminal nature,” according to the Hamas security forces. The Israeli authorities have so far refused to grant Human Rights Watch permission to enter Gaza to present its report there. And in a twist, the report comes as Mr. Shakir, an American citizen, is fighting an Israeli deportation order after the authorities moved to revoke his work visa under a contentious 2017 law barring entry to people who have promoted boycotts against Israel. The Israeli authorities have accused Human Rights Watch of anti-Israel bias in the past and compiled a dossier on Mr. Shakir that documents his activities in support of a boycott, mostly from before he joined the advocacy group. The dossier also points to a 2016 report by Human Rights Watch that called on businesses to cease activities that benefited Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.",The New York Times
2018,"Pando, the Most Massive Organism on Earth, Is Shrinking","Trilobites The grove of 47,000 quivering aspen trees in Utah is being diminished by mule deer, foraging cattle and human mismanagement. On 106 acres in Fishlake National Forest in Richfield, Utah, a 13-million-pound giant has been looming for thousands of years. But few people have ever heard of him. This is “the Trembling Giant,” or Pando, from the Latin word for “I spread.” A single clone, and genetically male, he is the most massive organism on Earth. He is a forest of one: a grove of some 47,000 quivering aspen trees — Populus tremuloides — connected by a single root system, and all with the same DNA. But this majestic behemoth may be more of a Goliath, suggests a study published Wednesday in PLOS ONE. Threatened by herds of hungry animals and human encroachment, Pando is fighting a losing battle. The study, consisting of recent ground surveys and an analysis of 72 years of aerial photographs, revealed that this unrealized natural treasure and keystone species — with hundreds of dependents — is shrinking. And without more careful management of the forest, and the mule deer and cattle that forage within him, the Trembling Giant will continue to dwindle. “It’s been thriving for thousands of years, and now it’s coming apart on our watch,” said Paul Rogers, an ecologist at Utah State University who led the study. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] How Pando got so big is a mystery. Perhaps it lived among other clones and became dominant over time. Or maybe the relatively flat land where it grows encouraged its spread. Maybe Pando just outcompeted other trees. Pando isn’t alone: there are other groves of single-clone aspens in North America that dominate their landscape, though none as massive. They reproduce asexually. Instead of growing from seeds, sprouts emerge directly from roots within the tree’s underground web. Each tree is one stem among thousands that belong to a single clone. When damaged, aspens send out hormonal signals saying, “Hey roots, time to make replacements.” Pando is constantly reproducing, which is essential to its resilience. Lacking genetic diversity, it relies on having trees of different sizes and ages. That way, if one layer or generation dies off, there’s another waiting to replace it. But Pando’s critical demographics are out of balance. When Dr. Rogers and Darren McAvoy, a forestry colleague at Utah State, surveyed the forest, they found that older trees were dying, as expected, but that, on the whole, young ones weren’t replacing them. “If this were a community of humans, it would be as if a whole town of 47,000 had only 85-year-olds in it,” Dr. Rogers said. “Where is the next generation?” Perhaps they are being eaten or trampled. Inadequate fencing, or the absence of it, seem to leave young patches of forest at the mercy of hungry mule deer, which are seeking refuge from hunters and increasing human activity. Foraging cattle, allowed into the forest in the summer, are another factor in Pando’s shrinkage. Aerial photos also revealed that Pando’s crown steadily thinned as human activity grew, especially in the last half century, with the addition of campgrounds, cabins and a telephone line, which drew animals that graze on forest leaves and shoots. “All these human actions have favored these browsers — their numbers, their lack of movement — so that they have a safe haven,” said Dr. Rogers. “And all of this is to the detriment of the survival of this clone.” But there’s hope for Pando as managers learn from past mistakes and take advantage of an improved understanding of forest ecology. Where one section of the forest has been properly fenced off and managed, trees have grown tens of feet in just a few years. Pando’s genetics may encourage its fast growth in new areas. More fencing, culling of deer, and experimentation with the forest’s natural ecology ultimately might save Pando, Dr. Rogers said. And educating the public about the giant’s significance may spur novel conservation methods. For instance, saving common species such as aspen, which support high biodiversity, might be just as important as saving rare, charismatic species. “If we can save this, there are lessons that may help us save hundreds to thousands of species worldwide,” Dr. Rogers said. “If we can’t manage that 106 acres and restore it, what does that say about our greater interactions with the earth?”",The New York Times
2018,Paradise Threatened: Fiji’s War Against Climate Change,"The South Pacific nation faces major environmental challenges, from the destruction of coral reefs to rising sea levels. At least one resort is asking tourists to help. An aerial view of the shore line of Kadavu Island in Fiji.CreditCreditAsanka Brendon Ratnayake for The New York Times Between the international airport in Nadi, Fiji, and the capital city of Suva, the coastal road on the island of Viti Levu is lined with resorts and clogged with tour buses. It’s a route I took several times this spring when I visited friends in Suva, a bustling port city where cruise ships drop anchor year-round and deposit thousands of tourists. The steady stream of hulking ships is emblematic of Fiji’s popularity, and a major source of income. But the country’s reliance on tourism, combined with vigorous development and the effects of rising global temperatures, have conspired against Fiji’s fragile environment. The country now faces major environmental challenges, including deforestation, unsustainable fishing practices, and the introduction of invasive species, such as the crown-of-thorns starfish, that have led to the destruction of coral reefs. Rising sea levels has led to the erosion of Fiji’s coastal areas, and the intrusion of saltwater has destroyed farmland and forced residents to move to safer ground. Before I arrived, I had read that Pacific Island nations were threatened by rising temperatures and sea levels, but it wasn’t until my fifth day there, when my friends and I flew 45 minutes on a small prop plane to the island of Kadavu, that the threat came into full view. Outside the shack that doubled as the terminal, we climbed into a pickup truck for the bumpy ride to a boat landing. There, we boarded a banana boat for a one-hour ride past shallow reefs and gumdrop specks of land until we reached a lagoon and Matava, a minimalist resort where we planned to stay two nights. Walking around the grounds, which were built on a steep hill, the damage from Tropical Cyclone Keni, which had swept through the islands in mid-April, three weeks before our arrival, was obvious. Boats in the lagoon were out of commission. A pool that was under construction was a mess. A tree had fallen on top of the dive shop and hit one of the compressors. A path to a nearby village had disappeared in a landslide. The storm had packed winds of more than 75 miles per hour and dropped nearly a foot of rain on Viti Levu. Kadavu was more directly in the storm’s path, and more than 800 homes were damaged. The storm came just a week after another cyclone, Josie. Fiji Vanua Levu FIJI Nadi Viti Levu Suva Outrigger Fiji Beach Resort Beqa Kadavu Matava 40 miles By The New York Times Keni and Josie were not as strong as the fierce Winston cyclone, which hit Fiji in 2016. But what surprised islanders was that the storms arrived weeks after the cyclone season was supposed to have ended. Although there is still much scientific debate about the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones, to many islanders the timing of the storms are evidence that warming temperatures are leading to shifting weather patterns and leaving the island increasingly vulnerable. “We literally said, ‘Let’s build the pool because the cyclone season is over,’ and then we got hit,” Luke Kercheval, one of the owners of Matava, told me, adding that the storms had scared off visitors. “We got more rain in a week than some countries get in a year. That’s not normal.” “Donald Trump might not agree, but it’s 100 percent about climate change,” he added. “I don’t need to be a scientist to figure this out.” The topic of climate change was everywhere in Fiji, even at the airport in Nadi, where a billboard read, “Airports Addressing Climate Change.” Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, is the current president of COP23, the United Nations Climate Change conference. In November, he brought two Fijian children with him to a conference in Bonn to remind delegates that the future of Fiji depends on action against the effects of climate change. Already, one-quarter of the country’s bird species and two-thirds of amphibians are threatened or endangered because of rising sea temperatures and overfishing. A billboard I spotted captured the mood well: “We are all in the same canoe rising up against climate change.” The ever-present discussion about Fiji’s fate gave me pause. Would Fiji’s stunning islands look the same in a decade or two? The soft breezes and gentle sunsets and crystal blue water at Matava made it hard to muster alarm. It also made me recall a conversation I had a few days before with Dick Watling, the founder of Nature Fiji, an environmental conservation group. Mr. Watling arrived in Fiji about 35 years ago and was an astute observer of local politics and the issue of climate change. Over coffee at Cappuccino Republic in Suva, Mr. Watling said that Fiji’s leaders, like those elsewhere in the Pacific region, have become expert at extracting donations from wealthier nations. So he was not surprised that many of Fiji’s problems were being blamed on climate change because it might help attract foreign aid, while also letting lawmakers sidestep thornier issues like unbridled development and lax environmental regulations. “The government sees this as a major opportunity,” Mr. Watling said. “COP23 is the best tourism marketing program we have ever produced by a country mile.” Signs of eco-tourism were certainly evident in Fiji. At Matava, solar panels generated most of the electricity, including the lights and fans in our huts. The fruit and vegetables we ate were grown locally and the fish was caught nearby. The eggs came from the chickens at the resort. Bottles, cans and other recyclables were sent back to Viti Levu. Living off the land did little to protect against Cyclone Keni, though. One of the resort’s boats had flipped upside down and its outboard motors were damaged. The chickens were swept away and the vegetable gardens were destroyed. Several workers at the resort lost their homes. The damage to the reefs made finding fish harder. I chatted with Maika O’Conna, a boat captain who grew up on Kadavu who said traditional fishing grounds were under attack from poachers, too. Overfishing and the destruction of the reefs was something I heard discussed back on Viti Levu. One day, I took a trip with my friend Sharon to the Outrigger Fiji Beach Resort, about a two-hour drive from Suva. There, the reef had been damaged by repeated storms and polluted runoff from a nearby stream. With the help of a Japanese aid organization, the hotel built coral gardens that its guests help maintain. The gardens consist of large metal grates, or propagation racks, placed in the water about 100 feet from the shore. Jonacani Masi, one of the hotel workers, took us out to see them. He brought a dozen cones made of sand mixed with concrete that were the size of my hand. When we reached the grates, he dove underwater and returned with a healthy piece of brown spiky coral that looked like a deer antler. He broke it into smaller, finger-length pieces, and placed each one in a cone packed with quick-drying cement. Snorkels and masks on, we swam down to the grates and placed the cones in the openings. We saw dozens of other cones with healthy-looking coral stems already there. Together, they created a small reef where none had existed. Fish nipped at my legs, protective of their newly claimed territory. When the coral fingerlings were big enough, they were replanted in the natural reef elsewhere. “The reef was there for the taking, but it was also abused,” Kinijoji “Kenny” Sarai, Mr. Masi’s boss, said over a lunch of Spanish mackerel marinated in coconut milk, lemon and vinegar. Overfishing by locals depleted the reefs’ aquatic population, and forests cleared by developers led to more pollutants being dumped into rivers that flowed into the ocean, damaging the reefs. “We’re trying to bring the coral back to life.” Mr. Sarai, who grew up in a nearby village, said the locals are concerned about the damage to the reef. Part of its restoration included helping the reef regenerate, and also trying to convince locals not to fish in reefs being repaired. Though they were reluctant to see restrictions on their fishing rights, many villagers work at the Outrigger and other resorts and recognized that restoring the reef was a key to attracting tourists and, ultimately, preserving their jobs. “People in Fiji know tourism is the big money earner,” he said. “There’s a national conversation around eco-tourism.” The next day we set off for Beqa, an island six nautical miles offshore, to meet Sefano Katz. An Israeli by way of Australia, Mr. Katz is a marine biologist and an expert in coral ecosystems. He arrived in Fiji three years ago with the nonprofit group Pacific Blue Foundation to help the locals on Beqa preserve their reef, which is 10 miles wide and one of the largest in Fiji. He lives in a village of about 200, where he teaches children about composting and restoring mangrove forests, which help protect the coastline from erosion caused by storm surge. He works with the elders to improve the sewage treatment so that polluted water doesn’t seep into the ocean. Villagers are also removing the crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat coral, from the reef. Mr. Katz said he focuses on steps the villagers can take on their own rather than broad concepts like fighting climate change. He pointed to a study that showed that 48 percent of the damage to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia was from tropical storms and cyclones, and another 42 percent from crown-of-thorns starfish, whose population has exploded because of an increase in phosphorus runoff from sewage, and other issues. This, he said, was similar in Fiji. “People protect what they understand,” he said. “That’s the way to make change.” Mr. Katz took us to meet Filipe Kirikirikula, the 60-year-old head of the council of elders. We sat outside his home in the middle of the well-kept village by the beach. He supported Mr. Katz’s mission, which he said required changing age-old habits. “Most of the people just abuse the environment,” he said. “It’s quite difficult to teach them about conservation. People here have their own freedom.” The days of going out on the reef with a spear to catch dinner were disappearing, he said. So he supported a plan to create an area to raise clams and fish that would be protected from poachers. It would also repopulate the reefs, which in turn would attract more divers who could be charged a fee, he said. As the afternoon waned, Mr. Katz took us back to the mainland on his boat. Beqa, which legend has it, is home to the Fijian shark god, Dakuwaqa, faded from view as we skipped over the waves and around the swells. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2018,Paris Art Dealer Brings the Party to New York,"Emmanuel Perrotin, a blue-chip gallery owner, treats the global art market like a giant soiree. It was Saturday night of New York Fashion Week, and everywhere Emmanuel Perrotin turned, hands were being thrust at him. Ronnie Fieg, the founder of Kith, the cool-kid street wear brand, congratulated him. Johan Lindberg, the Swedish fashion designer and party fixture, paid his respects. Next up were Alexandre Arnault, the 26-year-old son of Bernard Arnault, and his younger brother Frederic, who seemed to take in the festive atmosphere with an appraiser’s eye. Also swirling around Mr. Perrotin in the crush of street-style poseurs were beau monde bohos like Kaws, Alexandre de Betak, André Saraiva and Jefferson Hack. From the sidewalk, outside the old Beckenstein Home Fabrics building on Orchard Street, it looked like yet another A-list party on the fashion circuit. But inside, as everyone in attendance knew, this was the latest art opening orchestrated by Mr. Perrotin, 50, the highly sociable gallery owner from Paris, who has emerged as one of the savviest showmen on the global commercial art scene. Wearing a blue-and-white seersucker jacket and chalk-white Adidas sneakers, he darted around his three-story Galerie Perrotin with the manic energy of a hotel manager in a French sex farce. “I feel it’s important to create a bridge between different worlds,” Mr. Perrotin said of the eclectic mix of artists, hype-beasts and fashionistas churning around him. Known for discovering the superstar artists Takashi Murakami and Maurizio Cattelan (as well as Damien Hirst, the one that got away), Mr. Perrotin now has six galleries — in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and, most recently, Shanghai — that are as much Instagram-friendly party spaces as they are places to view and buy contemporary art. “He understood, from the very beginning, social media and its impact and its ability to reach audiences which are not typical museum or gallerygoers,” said Daniel Arsham, 38, the pop-dystopian artist whose new show, which included a full-size replica of a decaying DeLorean, was opening. “There’s a lot of people here tonight that this is not their usual thing to do.” After the opening, guests continued to the rooftop, which offered expansive views of Lower Manhattan, an open bar, trays of canapés and a D.J. booth facing a dance floor. Around 11 p.m., multicolored Mylar balloons and sheet cake were brought out for Mr. Arsham’s birthday. “He doesn’t do dinner like Larry does,” said Jean-Paul Engelen, the deputy chairman of Phillips, referring to Larry Gagosian, the mega-gallery owner. “He does a party.” Mr. Perrotin’s path up through the commercial art world was different than the route most gallery owners take. Raised in a middle-class household on the outskirts of Paris, he made his first art connections as a middle-school dropout at age 16, when he met the daughter of Gilbert Brownstone, a gallery owner, at Les Bains-Douches nightclub. By 17, he was helping to run a small gallery started by Charles Cartwright, who exhibited works by Marina Abramovic, George Condo and others. “Even on the dance floor, I was able to make calculations about margins” from selling art, Mr. Perrotin said. It proved to be a short apprenticeship. By 21 he opened his first gallery, inside a large apartment he rented in the Third Arrondissement of Paris. During the day, he shared it with Hedi Slimane, then an unknown designer, who used it as a showroom. At night, Mr. Perrotin slept on the sofa. From there, his art cachet rose rapidly with an amazing string of emerging artists. In 1991, when he was 23, he staged Mr. Hirst’s first commercial show. (Mr. Hirst decamped to Jay Jopling’s White Cube gallery shortly after.) The following year, Mr. Perrotin signed Mr. Cattelan after meeting him at an art opening in Milan. “He had a pure energy that was very communicative,” Mr. Perrotin said. “I clicked right away.” In 1993, he stumbled upon Mr. Murakami at an art fair in Yokohama, Japan. They hit it off, even though they didn’t speak a common language, communicating instead by exchanging drawings. A year later, for a New York art fair, Mr. Perrotin created three T-shirts featuring Mr. Murakami’s big-breasted Hiropon figures. When they sold out, Mr. Perrotin offered him a solo show in Paris. In those days, Mr. Perrotin was selling works for $500. Those same artists can now command more than $15 million at auction; a sculpture by Mr. Cattelan that depicts Hitler, for example, fetched $17 million in 2016. Mr. Perrotin represents around 50 artists, including the conceptualist Paola Pivi, 47, who makes life-size feathered polar bears in cartoon colors; and the minimalist Claude Rutault, 76, who requires canvases to be painted the same color as the surface on which they’re hung. Newer artists still speak of Mr. Perrotin as not just a gallery owner, but also as a mentor and a friend. “I met Emmanuel when I was 22 years old, fresh from my graduation,” Mr. Arsham wrote last month on Instagram on the eve of his 15th show. “He came for a visit to my 200-square-feet foot studio with no windows in Miami.” “He’s an old school dealer like Leo Castelli who is personal friends with many of his artists,” he added, “yet futuristic in his embrace of social media and the egalitarian effect its reach can bring.” Massimiliano Gioni, the artistic director of the New Museum in Lower Manhattan, who has known Mr. Perrotin for over 20 years, takes a broader view. “The history of Emmanuel’s gallery is a history of art in the 21st century,” Mr. Gioni said. “Emmanuel was part of a change in the ’90s that art was part of not only popular culture and fashion, but was meant to be part of everyday life.” Mr. Gioni paused before adding: “In the process, of course, he threw a few legendary parties, and ran basically a club business on the side.” In Paris, the capital of his Napoleonic art empire, Mr. Perrotin hopped around different spaces before settling four years ago into the grand ballroom in a 17th-century hôtel particulier, along the trendier edge of the Marais district. Along with an 18th-century mansion nearby, he has 25,000 square feet of gallery space — and that’s not including the stately apartment a few steps away where he lives with his wife and toddler son. The gallery’s visitor-friendly posture, proximity to high-fashion boutiques and buzzy art openings were seen as an egalitarian innovation. Traditionally, Paris dealers “wanted to speak only to art critics and clients, and not waste their time with the public,” Mr. Perrotin said. “The galleries had a buzzer; it was intimidating to go. Even the documents to explain things weren’t given to everybody, only to journalists.” Mr. Gioni put it more bluntly: “His attitude helped transform the relationship of everyday citizens to art.” In recognition of Mr. Perrotin’s cultural perestroika, the French culture minister, Françoise Nyssen, made him an officer the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the country’s cultural honor roll in July. (Similarly, Mr. Perrotin attended the White House state dinner last April for President Emmanuel Macron of France.) No such barriers, of course, exist in New York. So when Mr. Perrotin opened his first gallery in Manhattan in 2013, in a former bank on Madison Avenue that he shared with the Dominique Lévy Gallery, he didn’t spare any expenses. To make a splash on the city’s jaded art scene, he hosted a lavish after-party at the Russian Tea Room, spooning lobster and caviar for 1,000 guests including the musicians Pharrell Williams and Swizz Beatz; the fashion designers Olivier Theyskens, Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochs; and art-world bigwigs including Peter Brant, Simon de Pury and Jeffrey Deitch. The top floor was transformed into a carnival, where guests competed to win miniature sculptures by KAWS, plaster facsimiles of gadgets by Mr. Arsham and plushy toys by Mr. Murakami. The art blog Arrested Motion called it the “art party of the year.” The Upper East Side space, however, proved too small for his ambitions. Last year, after a meticulous renovation, he moved into the old Beckenstein Home Fabrics at 130 Orchard Street. It offers 25,000 square feet of space, including a glorious rooftop where Alicia Keys performed a mini-concert this summer for the opening of a show by the artist JR. Mr. Perrotin is also in the process of building a duplex apartment on the roof. As with his first gallery in Paris, he likes to sleep near his art. “I’m very happy and proud of the parties, but don’t attribute my success to that,” Mr. Perrotin said, surveying the scene at the Arsham opening. “For sure, that’s because of the artists.”",The New York Times
2018,Parts of America Are Still Struggling Economically. They Don’t Matter Much in the Midterms. ,"The most competitive districts in the race for control of the House are disproportionately prosperous — and their economies aren’t doing much to lift Republicans. With just days to go before the midterm elections, President Trump is making an economic appeal to well-off suburban voters: Elect Republicans, the president warns in tweets and a new national ad, or kiss the good economic times goodbye. That appears to be the right audience for a closing pitch, but it may not pay off as the president hopes. The competitive districts that will decide control of the House are richer and more economically vibrant than the country as a whole. But there is little evidence that the thriving economies in those districts are buoying Republican candidates enough to guarantee victories against well-funded Democratic challengers. The concentration of battlegrounds in prosperous areas could have important policy implications for the next Congress, with swing-district representatives more concerned with preserving their region’s own good fortunes than with helping large parts of the country that continue to lag economically. And it does not appear to be helping Republicans in their quest to retain control of the House, defying the hopes that party leaders expressed when they passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year without a single Democratic vote. Consider three Republican-held districts that the Cook Political Report ranks among the 73 most competitive races this fall: In California’s 49th District, the typical household earned nearly $90,000 last year, a 9 percent jump from the year before. In Minnesota’s Third District, the poverty rate is down to half the national average. In Virginia’s 10th District, unemployment is at a rock bottom 2.6 percent, well below the national jobless rate of 3.7 percent. Republican candidates are trailing in all three races, with their Democratic rivals running at or near 50 percent, according to polls conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. To flip control of the chamber, Democrats must win 23 seats now held by Republicans. The most recent polls shows Democrats favored to win control of the House. Democrats have tried to use the economy against Mr. Trump, even though job creation and economic growth are strong. In competitive contests in well-off districts, Democratic candidates criticize Mr. Trump and Republicans about the rising costs of housing and health care as well as the inequity and long-term costs of the tax cuts. “I see a lot of people who, if they vote with their pocketbook, and they’ve maybe sided with Republicans because of that, they’re taking another look” this year, said Mike Levin, the Democratic candidate in California’s 49th District, which includes a strip of coastline running from north of San Diego to the southern suburbs of Los Angeles. “Today, I feel like, to the extent we’ve seen gains, we’re on a sugar high. And I have young kids — I know a lot about that.” It is possible, of course, that Republicans in tight races would be in even worse shape were it not for the strong economy. An analysis of polling data suggests Republican candidates are performing modestly better, relative to expectations based on their performances in past elections, in districts where the unemployment rate is lower or has fallen faster than in other districts. On a national level, the economy may be helping lift Mr. Trump's approval ratings, which, if historical patterns hold, could help Republicans avoid steeper losses in the midterm elections. But those effects are not nearly large enough to help Republicans avoid costly and contentious races in some of the most vibrant parts of the country, particularly in suburbs of high-performing metropolitan areas. “Those are the places where the president is the most toxic, outside of urban areas,” said Amy Walter, the national political editor of the Cook Report. “It’s not about their pocketbook. It’s about partisanship, and it’s also about cultural issues.” Moreover, many swing voters appear skeptical of Republican claims on the economy. Surveys have consistently found that independent voters are less sanguine about the economy than Republicans, and Mr. Trump’s signature economic policies, such as last year’s tax cut, poll poorly with that group. And women — including the suburban white women who are the target of recent Republican ads — report feeling significantly less positive about the economy than men, according to a recent survey conducted for The Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey. A study to be released this week by the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank in Washington that advocates policies to help economically distressed parts of the country, finds that 28 of the 70 most competitive House districts this year rank as “prosperous” — the highest quintile — on the group’s distressed communities index. Another 15 districts rank in the next quintile, “comfortable.” Those districts have higher incomes and faster job and business growth than other areas. Only six of the most competitive districts rank as “distressed,” the lowest quintile in the index. As a group, the 70 most competitive districts have not seen their incomes grow more, or their unemployment rates drop faster, than the rest of the country since Mr. Trump took office. But they began the Trump era in better shape than the rest of the country. In 2017, the median household income in a typical competitive district was just over $66,000, according to the Census Bureau. For the typical noncompetitive district, it was just under $57,000. The median income for a “prosperous” competitive district was more than $73,000. Those districts frequently run through the suburbs of large cities in high-income states. The “prosperous” and “comfortable” list includes four districts in California and three each in New Jersey, Minnesota, Florida and Texas. It also includes Colorado’s Sixth District, one of the most prosperous in the nation according to the Economic Innovation Group rankings, where the incumbent, Representative Mike Coffman, a Republican, is trailing badly in the polls. The broad universe of competitive seats is wealthier and whiter than the nation as a whole, the Economic Innovation Group analysis finds. But in a narrower group of seats that could hand Democrats control of the House by themselves — those that Cook ranks as “toss up” or “lean Democratic” — the relatively high-earning population includes a larger share of immigrants than the typical district. The toss-up districts “are by and large pretty dynamic places, where the status quo is working rather well,” John Lettieri, the president of the Economic Innovation Group, said in an interview. “Things like globalization and immigration aren’t things to be feared there. They’re woven into the fabric.” That is certainly the case in west Houston and its suburbs, where the incumbent, Representative John Culberson, a Republican, is running neck and neck with Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a Democrat, in the toss-up Seventh Congressional District. More than a quarter of the population was born abroad. More than half is nonwhite. Mr. Culberson is leaning into the economy in his campaign. He said in an interview that his constituents, no matter where they were born, wanted a fiscal conservative to continue “the obviously successful economic policies” that have contributed to the growth of the area and its oil and gas companies. “Voters in my district understand that I’m the right person in the right place at the right time to keep the economy growing,” Mr. Culberson said, “because I always support tax cuts, I always support lightening the regulatory load, I always support the oil and gas industry.” In television advertisements, Ms. Fletcher has attacked Mr. Culberson largely on health care. Her first ad promoted Houston’s innovative economy and her work with businesses there. Those issues — and the nature of the House battlegrounds — stand in stark contrast to Mr. Trump’s focus in the weeks before the midterm elections, which has lingered on warnings about immigrants, particularly those in a caravan heading north from Central America. The warnings may do more to help rally conservatives in Mr. Trump’s base in many conservative states that are home to contentious Senate races, including North Dakota and Missouri. Mr. Trump’s new $6 million national television ad appears targeted more to the suburban voters who will decide control of the House. It features a woman in a leafy home, watching her young daughter play violin and remembering the aftermath of the recession. The woman votes Republican; her daughter appears to grow up to be a concert violinist. “Things are getting better,” the ad reads in closing. “We can’t go back.” Ms. Walter of the Cook Report said the ad might struggle to break through — against Mr. Trump’s own messaging. “O.K., that’s a nice ad, but he’s spending all day talking about birthright citizenship and sending troops to the border,” she said. “Which one should we be watching?”",The New York Times
2018,Passengers Are Stranded as Another European Airline Collapses,"Primera Air, a small low-cost airline that spent the last year expanding its reach from northern Europe to hubs in North America, filed for bankruptcy and ceased flying on Monday night, leaving passengers stranded at airports on both sides of the Atlantic. The airline had been jostling for a toehold in the crowded European market, where consolidation and the fierce battle for customers have led to the collapse of several airlines in recent years, including Air Berlin, Alitalia and Monarch in Britain. But Primera’s finances started to erode as it continued to offer new routes while contending with higher fuel costs, delayed airplane deliveries and issues like corrosion on its aircraft. On Monday night, after 14 years of operations, the company said it had failed to get an agreement for a short-term loan from its bank. “Without additional financing, we do not see any possibility to continue our operations,” Primera’s board said in a statement. The abrupt end left many hundreds of passengers stranded at airports. At Dulles International Airport outside Washington, Pavithra Selvakumar, a 24-year-old student, was stuck trying to get back to Britain after her Primera flight was canceled. There was no staff at the airline’s desk, she said Tuesday, and she was among 30 to 40 people trying to sort out their journeys. Some of them canceled their vacations. “I could see a girl crying here, there were old people, people with kids,” Ms. Selvakumar said. She was waiting to see if her family and friends might be able to transfer her some money for another flight. At Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, flights for about 370 Primera passengers were canceled, officials said. One of them, Eric Jetner, a 33-year-old singer and actor who had a ticket for a Monday night flight to Newark, said what was going on was unclear to even the staff at the desks. “The front desk attendants said they were trying to call the president of the company and nobody was answering the call,” Mr. Jetner said. Later, a letter was handed out explaining that the company had ceased operations, but there were not enough copies for everyone. “We had to take a picture of it,” he added. At London’s Stansted Airport, 400 travelers were affected. Primera had been growing at a furious pace. Over the last year, it regularly announced new flights from different airports in Europe, like Stansted, to airports in the United States and Canada. It tried to attract customers with trans-Atlantic fares as low as 149 pounds, or about $193, and flew narrow-body planes, like Boeing 737s. These aircraft were also used for shorter flights in Europe, keeping costs low. Still, the fleet was small. The company, based in Latvia and Denmark, had only 15 aircraft, according to its website, and one of the planes had problems with corrosion. One tangled with a Ryanair aircraft on a runway in May. And a delay in the delivery of planes from Airbus this year forced the company to cancel routes from Birmingham, England, to New York and Toronto. Despite low prices and new trans-Atlantic routes, the company could not grow fast enough to outpace rising oil prices, said Andrew Charlton, managing director of Aviation Advocacy, a consultancy. All low-cost airlines “have to live on the edge of their cash flow to get big enough to get the scale to be successful,” Mr. Charlton said. As the summer holiday period came to a close and bills started to pile up, the company decided to fold. Other European airlines have done the same in recent weeks. The Swiss airline Skyworks filed for bankruptcy at the beginning of September, while VLM, a Belgian airline, went into liquidation in August. Small Planet Airlines Germany, which tried to take the part of the market once occupied by Air Berlin before it went bankrupt last year, started restructuring in September. And other low-cost airlines could follow as they also struggle with the narrow margins, Mr. Charlton said. “Even if you take two or three routes from them, that will tip the balance,” he explained. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a stranded passenger at Dulles International Airport. She is Pavithra Selvakumar, not Selvakunar.",The New York Times
2018,Pasta Dreams and Flying Machines: Our Tuscan Adventure,"personal journeys A father takes his two young sons to Tuscany to savor pasta and the country’s rich history. Along the way, they discover that the straight path is not always the best path. Last year, we had some leftover airline credit on Norwegian Airlines. On the day it was set to expire, in a panic, I asked my 4-year-old son, Holt, where we should go. “I love pasta!” he said. “But not with red sauce.” In retrospect, perhaps I should not have organized an entire trip around trying to prove to my 4-year-old that he did, in fact, like pasta al pomodoro; he just didn’t know it yet. Yet how could I ignore that ancient proverb of Italy, chiseled above the gateway to every town: Sucus ruber omnibus dilectus, “All love red sauce.” Yes, Italy! We would go to Italy. At the time it seemed like such a good idea. Culture! Sun! Vespas! Ciao! It was only after buying the tickets that I remembered the problem with traveling with young children is that when it comes time to travel, you actually have to bring your young children with you. So, what do you do? Namely, do you ruin your life on their behalf? With kids in tow you cannot have long, lingering 20-course dinners. (You cannot have two-course dinners.) You cannot spend a whole day in an art museum scrutinizing the pathos of Caravaggio’s chiaroscuro. You cannot while away an afternoon reading Dante’s “Inferno,” downing six bottles of Chianti as Pavarotti belts his way through Tosca. In order for you to be happy, your children must be happy. If I’ve learned anything about living and traveling with children, it’s to keep things simple. Boil life down to its essence. Path of least resistance. So, here was our entire agenda for our Italy trip in June: “Eat as much pasta as possible.” Full stop. Anything else that happened would be purely a bonus. Our rough itinerary was to rent a car at the Rome-Fiumicino Leonardo da Vinci Airport and head up to Tuscany, spending three nights in the stunning Val d’Orcia region, where we would bounce around hilltop towns sampling the local pasta specialties. We would then flee north, to Siena and Florence. We would probably not see much art, if any. Our history lessons would be limited. We would eat pasta and then more pasta. We would turn pasta into a daily ritual, a prayer, a philosophical question, a prison sentence. We were either geniuses or fools. (Or both.) ITALY Florence TUSCANY Area of detail Rome Tuscany 200 miles Siena Siena Val d’Orcia San Quirico d’Orcia La Foce 20 miles By The New York Times Somehow we managed to survive the eight-and-half-hour flight to Rome trapped in a metal tube with our children and 200 other passengers. The airport was complete chaos. We finally located our lost luggage and a car with four wheels and, after a two-hour drive, jet lagged and completely discombobulated, we pulled into the dream that is Chiarentana, a huge, ancient Tuscan farmhouse built around a cobblestone courtyard with a linden tree at its center. Chiarentana is on the sprawling La Foce estate overlooking a pastel valley of lavender and cypress trees. Olive orchards spill forth. Crickets buzz. The view from every window feels borderline illegal. Beauty has a way of simultaneously welcoming you and keeping you at arm’s length. Iris Origo, an Anglo-American transplant, purchased La Foce in 1924 and proceeded to transform what was then a collection of poverty-stricken farms into a vibrant place, constructing an astonishing formal garden at the main La Foce residence, and building a school for the farm children of the valley. During World War II she took in several dozen orphans, which she wrote about in the evocative and slender “War in Val d’Orcia, An Italian War Diary 1943-1944.” Chiarentana is now run by Iris’s lovely daughter, Donata. They sell several varieties of their own olive oil, including the frantoiano, which can transform a simple piece of bread into a gustative epiphany of earth and arbor and sky. The place bleeds history. But my son Holt did not care about any of that. He was intent upon setting up a cheap plastic bowling set in that magical cobblestone courtyard. He created an elaborate game with arcane rules that could only be played in this courtyard, under this linden tree. I tried playing with him, but got it all wrong. “No, that’s the home pin,” he said, weary at such ignorance. There is something refreshing about watching the very young play in a very old place. We must care about history, but we must not care too much. The wheel of time spins. On our first full day in Tuscany we headed to the restaurant Dopolavoro La Foce, just down the road. “Are you ready?” I asked Holt. We ordered three pastas, including eliche with fresh ricotta and wild fennel. Eliche means propeller in Italian; the pasta is shaped like a spiral, or the path a propeller would make in the water. Holt enjoyed this information. Like many boys his age, Holt is fascinated by systems, shapes, how things work and don’t work; it seemed like his entire third year was composed simply of reciting a taxonomy of construction vehicles. The pastas came. They were divine. Life shrunk to its simplest ingredients. We do not need much to be happy in this world: something to slurp, something to sip. Everyone sat very quietly eating, even Max, our youngest. We marveled at the path propellers make from our mouths to our stomach. Suddenly Holt held his fork aloft, eliche skewered on its tongs. “This is the best thing in my life!” he exclaimed. From that very successful first lunch things became a bit wobbly. My children, like most children, do not sit at tables for extended periods of time. Why sit at a table? Tables are boring, flat things that cannot be slapped, climbed upon, taken apart without reprimand. Children wonder: Why do adults always sit at tables for hours and hours, talking and not talking? My children preferred hanging out with Bertoldo, the depressive, wise donkey of Chiarentana who bleats at the sadness of mortality each morning. Holt loves a good patch of sand from which he can narrate the history of the universe. Max loves a good door threshold. Or a ramp. He will spend half an hour opening and shutting a door or running up and down a ramp. But neither of them will sit at a table for very long. Oh no. On our second day, Holt also made the declaration that he hated all old buildings. This did not bode well for our trip. He made this announcement after we visited the geometric Horti Leonini Garden in the village of San Quirico d’Orcia and came across a medieval tower that had been destroyed by the Nazis as they retreated from the countryside during World War II. In Holt’s mind, all old structures would fall down on top of us. Entropy was inevitable. He woke up in the middle of the night completely inconsolable. “I hate old buildings!” he wailed over and over. “I want to go home!” In the gloaming, Bertoldo, the donkey, commiserated. We did not follow the logic of the toddler. We did not go home. We ate more pasta. So much pasta. In San Quirico, village of the fallen tower, we savored homemade pici al cinghiale at Trattoria Osenna. This is pasta made from a sumptuous ragu of wild boar. It will change your life. Pici is the local style of eggless peasant pasta; it is like plump, irregular strands of spaghetti, stretched out by hand. The term pici comes from the Italian word “appiciare” which is the ancient action of rolling and coaxing out those long, lumpy strings. The owner of Osenna, Luca, told us his mother, the chef, could stretch a single strand of pici to over six feet long. “You could wrap it around your whole body!” said Holt. Luca said this was not traditional but he would convey the idea to his mother. After several days of drifting through the villages of the Val d’Orcia, a life I could easily adjust to, we headed north to one of the true gems of Italy, Siena, an ancient walled city of winding passageways and bountiful gelaterias that is a perfect size for kids and adults alike. We walked up the hill and suddenly found ourselves face to face with the Duomo, that jaw-dropping cathedral adorned in its distinctive black and white stripes. I winced, wary of Holt’s allergy to antiquity, but he was awed by the intricacy of its facade, replete with biblical scenes, grumpy lions and saints frozen in various karate poses. Inside, we marveled at the giant mosaic covering the entire church floor and the Piccolomini Library, filled with an array of huge, illuminated manuscripts that took the breath away. On our way our of the cathedral, Holt wanted to light a candle. “Everyday you come here to bless God,” he said, completely out of the blue. Then: “This is my favorite building in the world.” The city is famous for its Palio di Siena, a 400-year-old manic horse race that circles the Piazza del Campio. Twice each summer 10 horses and riders representing the various “contrade” or districts of the city run pell mell around a temporary clay track. We were in Siena a week before the first Palio of the summer, and the clay had just been laid, and rickety bleachers erected all around the racetrack. Imagining the screaming hordes, we sneaked through the ropes into the middle of the piazza, the still-wet clay sticking to our stroller’s wheels. We were practically the only ones in the whole square, a moment of perfect serenity. Holt pretended he was a horse. Max pretended he was Holt. Later, after eating a divine tagliatelle al pesto made from zucchini and almonds and a simple, flawless spaghetti al pomodoro e basilico (Red Sauce!) which Holt declared was “pretty O.K.,” we wandered through the green oasis of L’Orto de’Pecci, once the site of a psychiatric hospital and now a cooperative garden with a little restaurant, resident peacocks and a sculpture of a giant steel head that you could walk inside called “Open Mind” by Justin Peyser. Everyone was happy: This was art that you could slap. We probably should have just stayed in Siena. It is like that other ancient Italian proverb: Libentissime cum liberis uno loco se continere. “When your kids are content, don’t move an inch.” But my wife had never been to Florence and so we headed up the winding autostradale for the last leg of our trip. Our Airbnb was in Oltrarno, the hip, Brooklyn-like Florentine neighborhood just south of the River Arno, filled with little eateries and shops selling artisanal rucksacks and handmade puppets. Our first day we ventured into the sweaty scrum of central Florence and were quickly repelled by a tsunami of tourists. Florence in the high season is a nightmare. You cannot breathe, you cannot move. Our whole family grew quite cranky until we bought some gelato alla stracciatella. It has been proven by science that gelato is the cure for all ills, including gout, gunshot wounds and existential despair. We didn’t even try to make it to the Uffizi Gallery or see the famous sites. My traveler alarm bells kept going off: We were missing out on the Caravaggios! But you are always missing out with kids. That is kind of the point. The beauty is in the miss. Instead, we headed to the small Museo Leonardo da Vinci, where the kids could crank and pull at all of his inventions, including what looked like the world’s first bow flex exercise machine. They were very happy. In one corner stood Leonardo’s helicopter, which resembled the eliche propellers we had eaten that first day. “It didn’t work,” I said to Holt, pointing to the helicopter. “It couldn’t fly.” This felt perhaps more tragic to me than it should, a metaphor for our times. Good ideas that never take off. “That’s O.K.,” said Holt. And it was. To complete the famous Dead Scientist Museum Double, we visited the first-rate Museo Galileo (just past the foolish hordes waiting for hours to get into the Uffizi!) It’s a rich space filled with cosmographic spheres, a pantheon of cannon-size telescopes, sensuous maps of the heavens, and two of Galileo’s actual fingers. One exhibit in particular caught my eye: a marble run with two paths of descent, the first a straight decline and the other a longer, lazy bend called the brachistochrone curve that goes down and then up again. By all appearances, the straight line, the shortest path, is the quickest route to the bottom. Right? Nope. Galileo discovered it was the brachistochrone curve, which, despite being longer, delivers the ball first. And as I watched Holt put marble after marble down each path, testing and retesting the hypothesis, I began to irresponsibly apply such principles to our little Italian adventure. The straightest way is not always the best way. Rather, by weathering the natural curves of life, by going down and then up, by lingering at the doorway for half an hour as Max joyfully closes and opens the door again and again, you are actually taking the more efficient path. Our last evening in Italy we skipped into the Boboli Gardens just before closing. The evening sunlight was loose and pillowy. We were almost completely alone; the masses toiled in the city beneath. The Boboli is a tiered Florentine paradise of ancient statues and geometric fountains and rambling hedgework. In one clearing we came across a strikingly modern sculpture: a clean, white marble oval entitled “Secret of the Sky,” by Ken Yasuda. The perfection of the form was startling against the wilds of the surrounding greenery. “It’s like a gem turned sideways,” Holt said. “It’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.” When you are 4, there is no such thing as hyperbole. Nearby, we found a magical little restaurant, Alla Vecchia Bettola, with communal tables and iron pots hanging from the ceiling. They managed to seat us despite being packed with Florentines. After 14 straight meals of pasta, this would be our last. By this point, the four of us were used to things. We were like a well-oiled machine. As soon as we sat, we ordered the children’s meals. The kids tolerated the tableness of the table. Max did not demand his customary ramp exercises. We had our iPhone apps at the ready but did not need them. We all seemed to sense this little experiment was coming to an end. A group from Quebec at our table remarked how well behaved our children were. “They are not like this normally,” I said. “They have been trained. Like seals.” The restaurant hummed. Locals laughed and made intricate gestures with their fingertips that meant all was not lost. I had one more bite of ravioli. And then I was done. I had finally overdosed on Italian food, something I did not think was scientifically possible. “Down,” said Max, pointing at the ground. And down we went. We had taken the wandering path and arrived at this moment, just in time. Reif Larsen is the author of the novels “I Am Radar” and “The Selected Works of T. S.

2018,Patrick Mahomes Rallies Undefeated Chiefs Past Broncos,"DENVER — Patrick Mahomes rallied the unbeaten Kansas City Chiefs back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter for a 27-23 win over the Denver Broncos on Monday night. The Chiefs (4-0) took a two-game lead over the Broncos (2-2) in the A.F.C. West with their sixth straight win over their rivals. Down 23-13, Mahomes directed a 12-play, 75-yard drive that ate up more than six minutes and culminated with a 2-yard touchdown toss to tight end Travis Kelce, then added a 60-yard touchdown drive, handing off to Kareem Hunt for the 4-yard score with 1 minute 39 seconds remaining. It was the first time since 2004 that the Broncos had blown a 10-point fourth-quarter lead at home. In between Kansas City’s scoring drives, the Broncos, who had run roughshod over the Chiefs all night — a 7.2-yard average per run — suddenly abandoned their ground game in favor of three-wide receiver sets that resulted in a quick three-and-out. Then, struggling punter Marquette King shanked a 35-yarder out of bounds, giving the Chiefs the ball at their 40 with 4:35 left. Mahomes overcame a couple of flags that put the Chiefs in a second-and-30 hole from Kansas City’s 31 and completed a 35-yard pass to Demetrius Harris down to the Broncos’ 11 at the 2-minute warning. The play should never have counted because the play clock expired before the snap, but referee Craig Wrolstad’s crew missed it. After the Chiefs took the lead, the Broncos reached the Kansas City 28, but Case Keenum overthrew an open Demaryius Thomas near the goal line racing down the right sideline. Then rookie Courtland Sutton caught a first-down pass but overhanded it back on a failed hook-and-ladder that was ruled a turnover on downs with 5 seconds left. Phillip Lindsay’s 1-yard touchdown run for Denver broke a 13-all tie late in the third quarter, and Brandon McManus extended the lead to 10 with a 46-yard field goal. Kelce’s touchdown catch got the Chiefs within three with 6:27 remaining. Denver’s three-and-out and shanked punt gave the Chiefs the ball at their 40 and brought the Broncos’ exhausted defenders right back onto the field with four-and-a-half minutes remaining. The officials had another big blunder when Mahomes had scrambled about one-and-a-half yards past the line of scrimmage before throwing to Kelce for a 29-yard catch early in the second half. Broncos Coach Vance Joseph appeared to reach for his red challenge flag but never threw it.",The New York Times
2018,Paul Banks Tours His Bright East Village Apartment,"My Space The Interpol singer lives and creates in a lofted living room with 10-foot-tall iron-frame windows. Age 40 Occupation Musician; lead vocalist of the rock band Interpol Location Manhattan’s East Village His Favorite Room: When he’s not at his beach house in Panama, Mr. Banks lives in a one-bedroom apartment in a converted textile factory, with 10-foot-high iron-frame windows you’d expect to find in an artist’s loft (indeed, he also paints). Even though Mr. Banks briefly lived in Jersey City, he said, “what I found is that I wind up in this neighborhood every day of my life.” Interpol recently released a new album, “Marauder.” Did you write the songs here? As Interpol, we write in rehearsals. But I definitely can make music here. I have a neat little device that allows me to plug a guitar and microphones into my laptop. My homework is lyrics, and to be honest, I do more of that on the beach. What’s the story behind that Fender guitar? This I found in a shop in Panama that sold air-conditioners and lint filters and had two guitars for sale. It’s a rare model. I had to have it. It’s got a triple humbucker, which is crazy. So much of modern art is abstract. I like that you paint and collect portraiture. All I paint is faces. I have my easel here by the window. I mostly paint character actors from B movies in the ’80s and ’90s. My favorite painting is of the last guy that Sylvester Stallone arm wrestles in “Over the Top.” I like the dramatic lighting and I like what character actors exude with their expressions. As a teenager listening to your favorite bands, what was your image of a rock star’s house? I really didn’t have one. My dream as a teenager was a desk by an open window overlooking the ocean. I was on a trip in Spain, and there was just this cheap hotel that me and my friends were staying in. There was a desk by a window that overlooked the sea. I was just, like, well, this is it. I never thought about city life, tour buses, travel. Just a desk by the ocean. Some artists believe they need the energy of a city like New York. I don’t need the chaos of the city to feed inspiration. I feel very inspired by sunlight and waves. I’m secretly a beach bum. If I were to live anywhere other than a beach, though, it would be New York. I’m not trying to trash my hometown.",The New York Times
2018,"Paul G. Allen, Microsoft’s Co-Founder, Is Dead at 65","Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft who helped usher in the personal computing revolution and then channeled his enormous fortune into transforming Seattle into a cultural destination, died on Monday in Seattle. He was 65. The cause was complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, his family said in a statement. The disease recurred recently after having been in remission for years. He left Microsoft in the early 1980s, after the cancer first appeared, and, using his enormous wealth, went on to make a powerful impact on Seattle life through his philanthropy and his ownership of the N.F.L. team there, ensuring that it would remain in the city. Mr. Allen was a force at Microsoft during its first seven years, along with its co-founder, Bill Gates, as the personal computer was moving from a hobbyist curiosity to a mainstream technology, used by both businesses and consumers. When the company was founded, in 1975, the machines were known as microcomputers, to distinguish the desktop computers from the hulking machines of the day. Mr. Allen came up with the name Micro-Soft, an apt one for a company that made software for small computers. The term personal computer would become commonplace later. The company’s first product was a much-compressed version of the Basic programming language, designed to suit those underpowered machines. Yet the company’s big move came when it promised the computer giant IBM that it would deliver the operating system software for IBM’s entry into the personal computer business. Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen committed to supplying that software in 1980. At the time, it was a promise without a product. But Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981. That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoft’s immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons — point-and-click computing rather than typed commands. The company would also produce the Office productivity programs for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations. “In his own quiet and persistent way, he created magical products, experiences and institutions, and in doing so, he changed the world,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s current chief executive, said of Mr. Allen in a statement. Mr. Allen’s partnership with Mr. Gates began when they were teenagers attending the private Lakeside School in Seattle. It was there that they got their start in computing, working from a school Teletype terminal that was linked to a far-away mainframe computer under a so-called time-sharing computer system, in which operators paid for the computing time they used. Funds for the system were originally supplied by proceeds from a school bake sale. Mr. Allen scored a perfect 1,600 on his SAT test, and went on to Washington State University. But after two years he dropped out to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston. Mr. Gates was nearby, attending Harvard University. When an early microcomputer was introduced, appearing on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine, Mr. Allen persuaded Mr. Gates to drop out of Harvard and move to Albuquerque, where a start-up called MITS had built a machine that has been credited as the first personal computer. The machine lacked software, and Mr. Allen and Mr. Gates, showing up at the MITS offices, promised that they could supply it. [Read more about the first personal computer.] Their first offering was Microsoft Basic. Both Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen were skilled code creators, but Mr. Gates was more the hard-charging, volatile businessman, while Mr. Allen played the peacemaker and negotiator in those early days. Within a few years, Microsoft moved from New Mexico to suburban Seattle. Though Mr. Allen stepped away from daily duties at Microsoft in the early 1980s, partly because of a deteriorating relationship with Mr. Gates, he remained on the Microsoft board until 2000. Mr. Allen left Microsoft after he learned he had lymphoma. But tensions had also flared with both Mr. Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, a close lieutenant who eventually succeeded Mr. Gates as chief executive. In his 2011 memoir, “Idea Man,” Mr. Allen recalled overhearing the two talk about reducing his stake in the company. [Read a review of “Idea Man.”] “They were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,” Mr. Allen wrote. But Mr. Allen held his ground and his shares. Mr. Gates said in a statement on Monday: “From our early days together at Lakeside School, through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft, to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the years, Paul was a true partner and dear friend. Personal computing would not have existed without him.” As Microsoft became the dominant personal computer software company, Mr. Allen, as well as Mr. Gates, who was the face of the company, became immensely wealthy. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he had a net worth of $26.1 billion. He was also an investor and a generous philanthropist. Mr. Allen donated more than $2 billion toward nonprofit groups dedicated to the advancement of science, technology, education, the environment and the arts. Among the scientific research organizations he funded were the Allen Institute for Brain Science in 2003 and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in 2014. And while some of his philanthropy was global, like a passion for ending elephant poaching, much of his post-Microsoft work centered on Seattle, where he became a transformative force behind many of the city’s leading cultural institutions. [Read more about Mr. Allen’s transformation of Seattle.] He restored the old Cinerama movie theater to modern standards seemingly ideal for watching science-fiction films, and he hired Frank Gehry to design the Museum of Pop Culture, which Mr. Allen founded in 2000 under the original name of the Experience Music Project. The wild, undulating building displayed items revealing Mr. Allen’s cultural obsessions, including guitars owned by Jimi Hendrix and Captain Kirk’s command chair from the 1960s television series “Star Trek.” In the 1990s, Mr. Allen bought a swath of land in the South Lake Union neighborhood to help build a Seattle version of Central Park, but the public ultimately voted down the plans. He took those real estate holdings and, through his company, Vulcan, developed South Lake Union into the home of Amazon. Google and other tech companies have been opening offices in that now revitalized neighborhood. “He has a definitive role of what we understand as today’s Seattle, which is about technology, about real estate and about a distinctive local culture with international visibility,” said Margaret O’Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington. Mr. Allen also used his wealth to acquire the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association in 1988 and the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League in 1996. Of all his investments, the ownership of professional sports teams was among the most incongruous. Sports owners, like it or not, are often in the spotlight, and Mr. Allen, by and large, had preferred to steer clear of media attention. Yet in 1988, at 35, he bought the Trail Blazers and promised to keep the franchise in the city, one of the smallest in the league. He often flew to games from Seattle and sat courtside with his mother. Soon after he bought the team, the Trail Blazers had one of their best runs in franchise history, making it to the N.B.A. finals twice in three years, losing both times. In a statement, Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, called Mr. Allen “the ultimate trail blazer — in business, philanthropy and in sports.” Mr. Silver said Mr. Allen, one of the longest-tenured owners in the league, was particularly interested in the league’s growth internationally and its embrace of new technologies. In the mid-1990s, the owner of Mr. Allen’s hometown Seahawks, Ken Behring, was considering moving the team to Los Angeles because he was unable to get public funding for a new stadium in Seattle. Mr. Allen was urged to step in to keep the team in Seattle. In 1996, he bought an exclusive option to purchase the team from Mr. Behring by July 1997, an option he ultimately exercised, buying the team for $194 million. Mr. Allen set about building the team a new home downtown. The team moved into CenturyLink Field in 2002, and Mr. Allen spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the stadium. Though he spoke infrequently to the media, he could often be seen at games, sometimes raising the “12” flag — representing the fans — before kickoff, a team ritual. [Read more about Mr. Allen’s ownership of the Seattle Seahawks] During his tenure the Seahawks made their only three Super Bowl appearances, winning the title once, in 2014. “I personally valued Paul’s advice on subjects ranging from collective bargaining to bringing technology to our game,” Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. Commissioner, said in a statement. One of Allen’s companies also owned a stake in the Seattle Sounders, one of the most successful franchises in Major League Soccer. The Sounders won the league title in 2016. It is unclear what will happen to Mr. Allen’s teams; the details of his estate are not public. The Seahawks alone are worth an estimated $2.58 billion. Few N.F.L. and N.B.A. clubs change hands, so any sale is likely to attract substantial bids. Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, to Kenneth and Edna (Faye) Allen. His father was a librarian; his mother a schoolteacher. He is survived by his sister, Jody Allen. Three years ago, when commemorating Microsoft’s 40th anniversary, Mr. Allen posted on Twitter a bit of the code for the company’s first software product. At the top, it said, “Copyright 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen.” “It’s weird to look at bits of code you wrote 40 years ago and think, ‘That led to where Microsoft is today,’ ” Mr. Allen said at the time. He sounded genuinely amazed. An earlier version of this obituary misstated the cities in which Mr. Allen owned professional sports teams. He owned an N.F.L. team in Seattle and an N.B.A. team in Portland, Ore.; the teams were not both in Seattle. An earlier version of this obituary misspelled Mr. Allen’s middle name. It is Gardner, not Gardener.",The New York Times
2018,"Paul Volcker, at 91, Sees ‘a Hell of a Mess in Every Direction’","DealBook The former Fed chairman, whose memoir will be published this month, had a feisty take on the state of politics and government during an interview. Paul Volcker, wearing a blue sweatsuit and black dress socks, stretched out on a recliner in the den of his Upper East Side apartment on a Sunday afternoon. His lanky 6-foot-7 frame extended beyond the end of the chair’s leg rest. He added an ottoman to rest his feet. “I’m not good,” said Mr. Volcker, 91, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who came to prominence after he used shockingly high interest rates to help end the runaway inflation of the late 1970s and early ’80s. Long one of finance’s wise men, he has been sick for several months. But he would rather not talk about himself. Instead, Mr. Volcker wants to talk about the country, the economy and the government. And if he had seemed lethargic when I arrived, he turned lively in his laments: “We’re in a hell of a mess in every direction,” he said. Hundreds of books surrounded Mr. Volcker — filling shelves and piled high on virtually every flat surface — as did pink pages of The Financial Times, folded into origami. “Respect for government, respect for the Supreme Court, respect for the president, it’s all gone,” he said. “Even respect for the Federal Reserve. “And it’s really bad. At least the military still has all the respect. But I don’t know, how can you run a democracy when nobody believes in the leadership of the country?” Before Mr. Volcker fell ill, he finished his memoir, “Keeping at It: The Quest for Sound Money and Good Government.” The book was supposed to be published in late November, but given Mr. Volcker’s health, its publisher, PublicAffairs, a unit of Hachette, moved its release up to Oct. 30. “I had no intention of writing a book, but there was something that kind of was irritating me,” he said. “I’m really worried about this governance thing.” The book, which Mr. Volcker wrote with Christine Harper, editor in chief of Bloomberg Markets, is a telling memoir about a man who not only redefined the role of Fed chairman but, after the financial crisis, conceived of a namesake rule that eliminated some of the most blatant risk-taking by Wall Street banks. The Volcker Rule, which was part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory legislation, is being chipped away at by Republicans, which doesn’t sit well with him. “There is no force on earth that can stand up effectively, year after year, against the thousands of individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars in the Washington swamp aimed at influencing the legislative and electoral process,” he wrote in the book. The memoir is at times a dishy tale of Mr. Volcker’s years in Washington. For example, while President Trump has complained in recent months about the Fed’s plan to raise interest rates, he isn’t the first to try to influence the independent Federal Reserve. Mr. Volcker recounts being summoned to meet with President Ronald Reagan and his chief of staff, James Baker, in the president’s library next to the Oval Office in 1984. Reagan “didn’t say a word,” Mr. Volcker wrote. “Instead Baker delivered a message: ‘The president is ordering you not to raise interest rates before the election.’” Mr. Volcker wasn’t planning to raise rates at the time. “I was stunned,” he wrote. “I later surmised that the library location had been chosen because, unlike the Oval Office, it probably lacked a taping system.” The book is not limited to tales of the past, however. It addresses current policy, like the 2 percent inflation target that has become the goal of the Federal Reserve. “I puzzle at the rationale,” he wrote. “A 2 percent target, or limit, was not in my textbook years ago. I know of no theoretical justification.” With a laugh, he told me that he believed the policy was driven by fears of deflation. “And we haven’t had any deflation in this country for 90 years!” But there is something more worrisome affecting policy than fear, he told me. Money. Over the din of traffic outside an open window, Mr. Volcker hoarsely sounded an alarm on the power it has to shape our culture and our politics. “The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy,” he told me. “We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive. And they don’t like government, and they don’t like to pay taxes.” Washington, when he arrived, “was a city filled with bureaucrats,” he said. “It didn’t make them bad.” At the time, civil servants — like his father, the township manager of Teaneck, N.J. — were respected. “I grew up in a world in which good government was a good term,” he said. But things have changed. Today, he said, Washington is overrun by lobbyists and think tanks. Mr. Volcker, who started a nonprofit to improve education for public service, contends that our educational system has been perverted by money. Schools like the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, he said, have failed to educate a new generation of civil servants. He said they no longer taught governing but policy — a shift that he contended allowed them to hold forums and discussions with generals and under secretaries. “Rich guys,” he said, “like to go.” He called it “hobnobbing wholesale.” “They can argue war and peace and poverty and everything else,” he said. “But when you go to a school of public policy, you’re not learning how to run the goddamn government. You’re learning how to debate political issues.” Unlike President Barack Obama, who invited Mr. Volcker to consult on economic and regulatory policy — and asked him if he would be willing to be Treasury secretary, he said — this White House hasn’t called him. Even so, he has met Mr. Trump twice, both times before he took office. The first meeting was after Mr. Volcker left the Federal Reserve in 1987. “I was walking down the street, somebody calls out: ‘Hey, Paul! Hey, Paul!’ He comes running across the street and says, ‘Hi, I’m Donald Trump.’” The other was an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Volcker to get Mr. Trump to use “The Apprentice” to raise money for a charitable organization. “We had a very nice lunch, and he said, ‘Interesting idea,’ but put me off otherwise,” Mr. Volcker said. Mr. Volcker is no great fan of the president, but he acknowledged that Mr. Trump had cannily recognized the economic worries of blue-collar workers. Mr. Trump “seized upon some issues that the elite had ignored,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any question about that, in kind of an erratic way, but there it is.” He wondered how many lectures and presentations he had sat through with economists “telling us open markets are wonderful, everybody benefits from open markets.” Eventually, Mr. Volcker said, someone in those lectures would always ask, “What about that poor manufacturer in my town?” But that concern was dismissed too easily, with talk of worker retraining or some other solution far easier said than done. Today, Mr. Volcker is already starting to worry about the next financial crisis. Asked about the stability of the banks, he said, “They’re in a stronger position than they were, but the honest answer is I don’t know how much they’re manipulating.” That, he said, is the real challenge facing economic policymakers. “Everybody talks about monetary policy,” he said, “but the lesson of all this is we need better, stronger supervisory powers.” Even as our conversation came to an end, Mr. Volcker looked as if he could keep talking for hours. I told him that, rather than look sick or depressed about the state of the world, he appeared energized. Or, I told him, that was at least the impression he left. “Leave it that way,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Paying a ‘Resort Fee’ When You’re Not at a Resort,"Resort fees. The term conjures up a poolside lounge chair, thick towels piled high nearby. But starting about two years ago, urban luxury and full-service hotels across the United States have increasingly adopted the fees. They may be called amenities or facilities fees and cover less glamorous goods or services like internet access and bottled water. Depending on the hotel, they may be hard to find when a traveler is booking a room online. But they are profitable for the hotels. Bjorn Hanson, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Professional Studies Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism, who has researched the fees, said that most of the fee cost goes directly to hotels’ bottom lines. Mr. Hanson projected that total fees and surcharges collected by hotels in the United States will reach a high of $2.93 billion this year, with another record projected in 2019. “The increase for 2018 reflects a combination of approximately 2.5 percent more occupied hotel rooms than in 2017, and 6 percent more fee and surcharge categories and higher amounts,” he said. Robert Mandelbaum, director of research information services for CBRE Hotels’ Americas Research, said: “Resort fees are a very profitable way for hotels to raise revenue and not advertise they’re raising room rates. By a strict definition, they’re not raising room rates but adding a mandatory fee.” The Pierre Hotel in New York City, for instance, imposes a daily surcharge of $30 plus tax for services like high-speed internet access, unlimited local and domestic long-distance calls, bottled water and continental breakfast in the lobby. The $25 daily fee, which does not include tax, charged by the Sofitel Washington DC Lafayette Square includes amenities like premium internet access, access to a bike sharing program, bottled water and yoga classes. According to the website ResortFeeChecker.com, as of July, 131 hotels in New York charged such a mandatory fee, 25 in Washington, 78 in Los Angeles and 47 in San Francisco. Last year, Mr. Hanson said, 42 percent of resort hotels charged resort fees, a figure he predicted would remain flat this year. But he estimated that the percentage of urban hotels charging such fees would climb to 8 percent this year from 2 percent last year. He further estimated that the total amount of resort fees collected by urban hotels should climb by $110 million this year. And he said he expected the fees to spread to some second-tier cities and suburban markets next year. Mr. Hanson said urban hotels’ fees are determined and imposed by their local general managers and typically range from $20 to $40 per night, plus local sales tax. Matt Arrants, executive vice president of Pinnacle Advisory Group, a hospitality consulting company, said urban hotels’ fees are proliferating because “hotels can charge them and get them,” adding, “People are willing to pay them and hotels consider them a value-add.” One reason guests are willing to pay them, he suggested, is that they have become accustomed to airlines imposing surcharges on everything from baggage checking to in-flight food. “The hotel industry is looking at the airline model and trying to increase revenue opportunities,” he said. “Although the U.S. hotel industry will have the highest occupancy rate in 2018 it has had since 1981, the room rate increase will be only 2.5 to 3 percent,” Mr. Hanson said. “At the same time, there’s a large increase in labor costs and real estate taxes and rising interest rates. Although occupancies can’t go up much more, room rates in many cases are not covering the increased expenses. Hotels thus have an unusual incentive to find additional forms of revenue and profit.” The fees are one way. He estimated that 80 to 90 percent of the fees generate profit for hotel owners. Not surprisingly, travelers’ reactions to resort fees charged by both urban hotels and resorts have been negative. Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research, a travel research firm, said in a report this year: “Hotel guests flat-out hate resort fees. In our Q1 2018 survey of 3,656 U.S. hotel guests, 91 percent expressed dislike about resort fees. The remaining 9 percent were neutral. No one liked them. Travelers see resort fees for what they are: indirect rate hikes.” Another problem for travelers can be the transparency of urban hotels’ fees, since hotels can be inconsistent in revealing fee details on their websites or on websites of online travel agencies. Fee information on smaller hotel booking websites, particularly those operated outside the United States, can be even more spotty. François-Olivier Luiggi, general manager of the Pierre, which is managed by Taj Hotels, said his hotel imposed its fee in January, when it upgraded its internet access. “The customer is getting used to fees everywhere,” he said. “We feel the fee is less than the combined value of our amenities.” “As a business,” he added, “you try to increase your rate every day to match inflation at least, and to find new ways to grow revenue by offering a variety of services and products.” He said that guest feedback to the fee has been “excellent,” since “we fully disclose it.” A Hilton spokesman, Nigel Glennie, said three of its hotels, all in New York, were testing these fees, which he said were “clearly disclosed during the booking process” and offered guests “a bundle of amenities and services,” including premium Wi-Fi, free local calls and a food and beverage voucher. A spokeswoman for IHG, Ada Hatzios, said “less than 3 percent of IHG-branded hotels in the Americas currently have a resort fee, and those that do disclose this to guests during the booking process.” A Marriott spokeswoman, Kathleen Duffy, said 14 of its 76 hotels in New York have been testing fees since the summer of 2017. She also said amenities covered by the fees can vary by season. Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental and AccorHotels declined to comment. Formal actions have been taken against the hotel industry because of the fees. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission issued a warning letter to hotels that charged resort fees without including them in their advertised daily room rate. In 2016, Thomas Luca Jr., a Pennsylvania traveler who booked a room online at a Wyndham hotel in Miami, sued the company in Federal District Court in Pennsylvania, alleging misrepresentation of its room rates on its website. Last week, he asked that the case be certified as a class action. A Wyndham spokeswoman, Nadeen N. Ayala, said she could not comment on the suit “as it is the subject of pending litigation.” In 2017 the attorney general for the District of Columbia sued to enforce an investigative subpoena it served on Marriott International in connection with a national investigation involving its office and those of attorneys general in 46 states concerning “deceptive price advertising techniques used by the Marriott.” All legal cases are pending. “With record high occupancy levels, especially in major urban markets, the consumer does not have a lot of leverage” over hotels in contesting fees, Mr. Mandelbaum said. A possible exception, Mr. Hanson said, could be business travelers whose trips are overseen by corporate travel managers, who he said have been contesting fees in negotiations with hotel companies, as have convention planners. “It’s buyer, beware,” said Jan Freitag, senior vice president for lodging insights of STR, a hotel research company. “There are still a lot of urban hotels that do not assess the fees. It behooves travelers to do their research before their stay.” Robert Cole, a Dallas-based hotel consultant, warned travelers who book online to carefully study how and where fees are listed on hotel and online travel agency websites. If fees are not revealed at the beginning of the shopping process, a hotel may be inaccurately perceived as cheaper than others. Longer term, Mr. Harteveldt warned, hotels’ fee policies could make them vulnerable. “Home-sharing businesses, such as Airbnb, could also leverage their lack of resort fees,” he said, “enabling them to steal more market share away from hotels.”",The New York Times
2018,Peacetime Spells Death for Colombia’s Activists,"After signing a peace deal with its largest rebel group, the FARC, the country saw its homicide rate fall to the lowest point in decades. Now killings are on the rise. Relatives and friends carrying the coffin of Holmes Niscué, an indigenous leader killed on August 19, in the mountains near Tumaco, Colombia.CreditCreditFederico Rios Escobar for The New York Times JAMUNDÍ, Colombia — First, he survived a machete attack. Months later, he begged a shadowy armed group to spare his life after hearing that his name appeared on its hit list. Then, in late July, armed men followed Libardo Moreno, a 76-year-old farming activist, back to his ranch here in western Colombia. They came to the gate, asking for help with a flat tire. When Mr. Moreno brought over an air pump, they shot him in the neck and chest. “He said, ‘They killed me, they killed me,’” recounted his wife, Margarita Fernández, who found him splayed on the concrete, blood pooling around him. “The motorcycles took off and they just left him there.” Colombia’s government officially declared an end to more than five decades of civil war in 2016, when it signed a peace deal with the country’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC. Within a year, the homicide rate fell to its lowest level since 1975, a remarkable turnaround for a country where a half-century of conflict had taken at least 200,000 lives. But a chilling aspect of the bloodshed isn’t falling: Killings of the nation’s activists, including union organizers, local councilmen, indigenous leaders and environmentalists who are under vigorous attack across the country. If anything, the killings appear to be on the rise in peacetime. Mr. Moreno is one of at least 190 community leaders to be killed so far this year, which means the country will probably far exceed the number of activist murders recorded in all of 2017, according to Colombia’s Institute of Studies for Peace and Development, a research group. Few of the cases have been solved by Colombia’s government, yet a pattern has emerged: Almost all of the murders have taken place in regions that FARC guerrillas abandoned last year when they demobilized as part of the peace deal. The departure of the FARC was at first a boon for activists and community organizers — a chance to push for infrastructure projects needed for decades, like roads, aqueducts and services in the countryside. But the government has yet to take control of many of the areas the rebels left. In their place, a mix of drug traffickers, paramilitary groups and breakaway rebel factions that rejected the peace agreement have taken over. These groups now see the activists’ development projects as a threat, bringing unwanted attention and potentially interfering with their illegal activities, residents say. And that has put activists at the mercy of criminal groups. “In these areas the FARC left, the state never arrived,” said Carlos Guevara, of the Somos Defensores, a research group that monitors attacks against activists. In just one bloody two-day period this summer, 10 activists were killed in eight different provinces, including a left-wing political organizer, a village leader and two representatives of an indigenous group shot dead on a country road the night of July 6. That same week, Martha Milena Becerra received a call that her mother, a community organizer outside of the western city of Quibdó, had also been shot dead, only moments after the two had talked by phone. “She would say, ‘Why would anyone come after me if I haven’t hurt anyone?’” recalled Ms. Becerra, who soon packed her belongings and fled the city with her sister. On Aug. 19, Marisel Tascus Pai was headed to a meeting with her husband, an indigenous leader named Holmes Niscué, when bullets rained down on him. Mr. Niscué was shot nine times. He had been recently blamed by guerrilla groups for a government raid against suspected drug traffickers, which left seven people dead in July. “We have no help, we are sleeping on the floor now,” said the widow, who has been in hiding since her husband’s funeral. Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group, said the killings of the social leaders could represent the beginning of a larger social breakdown in Colombia, despite the peace agreement with the FARC. “There was a period of tranquillity where people were holding their breath as town councils and social leaders were practicing politics freely for the first time,” he said. “But that is over now. There was a window which opened up, and the state did not jump through — but other armed groups did.” The killings present a daunting challenge for Colombia’s new president, Iván Duque, who took charge Aug. 7 and has pledged to make changes to the peace deal, which he calls flawed and in need of vast corrections. In a response to written questions from The New York Times, the government called the killings “a grave phenomenon which deeply worries the president.” It blamed the deaths on Colombia’s past years of violence and said the government was trying to find new ways of protecting community organizers and activists. “Colombia is a democratic country that offers guarantees to practice politics,” the government statement said. Other parts of the government have a different view. In July, the country’s inspector general, an independent office that oversees public officials, said in some cases criminal groups had worked with the police and military to organize the killings. The killings also have the attention of the United States, which provided the country with roughly $900 million in assistance between 2017 and 2018, split between anti-narcotics aid and measures for development and enacting the peace deal. Panama Colombia Medellín Quibdo Pacific Ocean Bogotá Cali Jamundí Ecuador 100 miles By The New York Times “It’s something we’ve talked to the Colombian government about quite a bit,” Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters in Bogotá. “To have lives threatened is unacceptable. And the United States always feels like we need to have our say to remind governments that we’re watching.” Yet the killings continue, including at least another 13 in August. Here in Valle de Cauca, the province where Mr. Moreno was shot dead, members of his town council have considered a mass resignation to avoid being killed. In Pindinché, a small mountain town in the province where an activist who pushed for water rights was shot dead in July, one of the man’s colleagues fretted over a new armed group that recently appeared nearby. The colleague now drives in a bulletproof car and carries a pistol. “I am not a violent man,” said the colleague, who asked not to be named for fear of being killed too. “I’m here to help this community.” Even in this province, where more than a dozen other social leaders had been killed this year, Mr. Moreno’s death came as a surprise. A former agricultural economist, he seemed to pose a threat to no one, especially given the projects he backed, like an aqueduct and a nursery school. The area had once been ground zero in the conflict with rebels. In the 1990s, the FARC repeatedly robbed the only shopping mall in the area in deadly raids. But the war was winding down, and Mr. Moreno wanted to organize the area’s farmers. “He immediately identified all the problems that had been years in the making,” recalled Andrés Moreno, his son. Mr. Moreno joined the village council and started a program for farmers to pool resources to grow and sell plantains. He pushed local officials to begin building an aqueduct to reach farmers in the countryside, something they had long said was impossible because of the rebels. Then, last June, the rebels disarmed — a moment many residents had waited a lifetime to see. For a while, people in the village, Las Pilas, thought the conflict was over. But the government sent no one to safeguard Mr. Moreno’s village: no police, no soldiers. Drug traffickers had already taken notice of Las Pilas, villagers say. It sits at the foothills of steep mountains that cross to the country’s largest Pacific ports and have long hidden coca leaf farms and clandestine labs used to process cocaine. Mr. Moreno was concerned that his development proposals might be running afoul of the new drug traffickers entering the area, his family said. “Paving a road or bringing an aqueduct is good,” said Alex Moreno, an in-law of Mr. Moreno. “But for a few, it is bad. It means there’s more access, more people — and more authorities can come.” Peacetime had also brought an influx of farmers who had previously fled their fields during the fighting. Some indigenous groups had settled the empty farms, claiming the ancestral lands belonged to them. Mr. Moreno increasingly found himself on the side of the displaced farmers in these disputes. Last year, Mr. Moreno was walking with a farmer on his land when a group of indigenous men descended on them with machetes. Mr. Moreno was beaten and stabbed. Andrés Moreno, Mr. Moreno’s son, became concerned that his father was stepping into too many new cross-fires. His vehicle was damaged twice by unknown assailants. “We said, ‘Dad, calm down,’” recalled the son. “He would go into these meetings and speak up, but everyone else would be quiet. They were getting scared.” Then in late June, two weeks before he was killed, word began to spread that he was on a hit list of a guerrilla group still in the mountains. The FARC had demobilized, but this band appeared to be a smaller rebel group that kept fighting, or a breakaway faction that never signed the peace deal. Mr. Moreno decided to meet them face to face. “He wasn’t scared,” recalled his son. “He said, ‘I’m here to help the community.’” The meeting took place in the mountains. A commander showed Mr. Moreno the hit list and said his name wasn’t on it. Still, the meeting made Mr. Moreno uneasy. He had never seen the commander before, and the group wore no badges with insignia showing who they were, Mr. Moreno’s son said. In the days before his death, three explosions hit the aqueduct Mr. Moreno had been championing. Some in Las Pilas suspected the drug trafficking groups; others assumed sabotage by the guerrillas. A few cast suspicion on the indigenous community arguing over access to water. On July 23, Mr. Moreno returned to his ranch after meeting politicians to discuss the attack. According to his wife, two motorcycles waited alongside the road, letting Mr. Moreno pass. A knock came at the gate of their farm. A man asked for a pump, claiming his tire had run out of air. “Boom, boom,” recalled Ms. Fernandez, Mr. Moreno’s wife, pointing to her neck to describe how her husband was killed. Alex Moreno, one of his in-laws, said the authorities failed Mr. Moreno in life by abandoning his village. But they also failed him in death: The police, he says, refused to come up to Las Pilas to collect the body, fearing the violence there. Mr. Moreno collected the bullet casings himself with gloves borrowed from a funeral home. “It’s impossible to ever find out who did this if the authorities wouldn’t even come to the crime scene,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Peggy Cooper Cafritz Leaves Collection to Two Arts Institutions,"By the time Peggy Cooper Cafritz died earlier this year, she had worked her way from a childhood in the Jim Crow South to become a Washington-based civil rights activist, educator and esteemed art collector whose private compendium of primarily African-American art was one of the largest in the country. Now, the majority of that collection is being given to a pair of organizations that share some of her passions. Ms. Cafritz bequeathed over 650 works of art to the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, the two institutions announced this week. The Studio Museum, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, will receive more than 400 works; the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, which Ms. Cafritz was a founder of, will receive over 250. “We are deeply grateful for this gift — which represents the amazing range of artists that Peggy Cooper Cafritz supported, nurtured and collected — and are incredibly grateful to steward her legacy,” Thelma Golden, the director and chief curator of the Studio Museum, said in an email. The works given to the Studio Museum include pieces by Kara Walker, Kerry James Marshall, Nina Chanel Abney, Sadie Barnette, Henry Taylor, Sanford Biggers, Theaster Gates and Nick Cave. Ms. Golden pointed out that the gift includes works by many artists who have a history with the Studio Museum, including Mr. Cave, who has exhibited there. “With this gift, we now have the first work by him to enter our collection,” Ms. Golden said. The Duke Ellington School is being given works by Hank Willis Thomas, BK Adams, Louise Bourgeois and Mark Thomas Gibson. In a statement, Tia Powell Harris, the chief executive of the school, said, “It’s as if we will now have direct access to Peggy’s amazing vision, seeing the world’s possibilities as she did.”",The New York Times
2018,"Peggy Sue Gerron Rackham, Who Inspired a Hit Song, Dies at 78","Peggy Sue Gerron Rackham, who became part of Buddy Holly’s circle of friends as a teenager and long reveled in having her name used as the title of one of his biggest hits, died on Monday in Lubbock, Tex. She was 78. Her son-in-law, Tom Stathos, confirmed the death but said he did not know the cause. As Ms. Rackham told the story, she was a sophomore at Lubbock High School in 1956 when she first encountered Mr. Holly, who had graduated a year earlier. She was walking to the school’s band room — she played alto saxophone — and he was rushing to the auditorium to attend an assembly. He crashed into her, sending her to the floor, her books scattering and her poodle skirt rising over her knees. “I’m terribly sorry, but I don’t have time to pick you up,” he said, as she recalled the moment in her autobiography, “Whatever Happened to Peggy Sue?” (2008). “But you sure are pretty.” He headed off. But she would get to know him better when she realized soon after that her boyfriend, Jerry Allison, was the drummer in Mr. Holly’s band, which would become known as the Crickets. “As a threesome, Jerry, Buddy and I spent most of our time together just hanging around at my house, listening to records or to Jerry arguing politics with my dad,” she wrote. She and Jerry went horseback riding, bowling and to the movies with Buddy and his girlfriend, Echo McGuire. Peggy Sue became “Peggy Sue” a year later. The Crickets were in the producer Norman Petty’s studio in Clovis, N.M., preparing to record “Cindy Lou,” a song the group had been performing. (Its title was reportedly a combination of Mr. Holly’s niece’s first name and his sister’s middle name.) But Mr. Allison was hoping to solidify his on-and-off relationship with Peggy Sue and asked Mr. Holly to change the song’s name. “I think Buddy liked it because he knew me,” she told the website MusicDish e-Journal in 2004. And, she added, Mr. Allison “always said, ‘Peggy Sue rhymes with everything.’ ” “Peggy Sue” — “pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue” — was released in 1957, shortly after Mr. Holly’s “That’ll Be the Day” reached No. 1. And it was almost as successful, rising to No. 3 on the Billboard charts. Mr. Holly shared writing credit for “Peggy Sue” with Mr. Allison and Mr. Petty (although the original label credited only Mr. Allison and Mr. Petty). Mr. Holly died in February 1959 in a plane crash in Iowa, along with his fellow singers Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper (J. P. Richardson). Ms. Rackham said she toured with the Crickets for a while after Mr. Holly’s death, counting tickets at the gate among other jobs. She eloped with Mr. Allison in 1958; their marriage ended in the 1960s. Peggy Sue Gerron was born on June 15, 1940, in Olton, Tex. Her mother, Lillie (Rieger) Gerron, was a homemaker, and her father, John, was a civil engineer. Over time, she worked as a dental assistant and owned a plumbing business with her second husband, Lynn Rackham. Ms. Rackham’s memoir, written with Glenda Cameron, was published shortly after “Peggy Sue” turned 50. To recall her time around Mr. Holly and the Crickets, she said, she used about 150 contemporaneous diary entries. “I wanted to give him his voice,” she told The Guardian in 2008. “It’s my book, my memoirs. We were very, very good friends.” Mr. Holly’s widow, Maria Elena Holly, threatened to sue Ms. Rackham over what she said were false claims in the book. “He never, never considered Peggy Sue a friend,” she told The Associated Press. Ultimately, Ms. Holly declined to sue because she thought the publicity would have helped Ms. Rackham sell books, her lawyer, Richard Wallace, said in an email. Ms. Rackham sustained her connection to “Peggy Sue” in other ways over the years. She judged a Buddy Holly look-alike contest, helped promote the musical “Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story” in Australia and appeared on Geraldo Rivera’s television program with the women behind other rock ’n’ roll songs, like “Angie,” “Barbara Ann” and “Donna.” She is survived by her daughter, Amanda Stathos; her son, Von Rackham; five grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Her marriage to Mr. Rackham ended in divorce. A song as popular as “Peggy Sue” ensured Ms. Rackham a dollop of everlasting fame. “It’s very hard to stand still,” she told the BBC in 2009, “when you’re listening to ‘Peggy Sue.’ ”",The New York Times
2018,Pence Speech to String Together a Narrative of Chinese Aggression,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence will signal a far tougher American line on China on Thursday, delivering a speech in which he is expected to accuse the Chinese of aggressive moves against American warships, of predatory behavior against their neighbors, and of a sophisticated influence campaign to tilt the midterms and 2020 elections against President Trump. “To put it bluntly, President Trump’s leadership is working,” Mr. Pence is to say, according to excerpts from his speech provided on Wednesday night. “China wants a different American president.” Mr. Trump accused China last week of meddling in the midterm elections, saying at the United Nations in New York that it was retaliating for his imposition of tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. But the president was careful not to antagonize China’s president, Xi Jinping, with whom he has cultivated a personal relationship. Mr. Pence, however, will broaden the attack on China to encompass its rapid military buildup in its coastal waters; its use of debt financing to corrupt financially vulnerable countries; and its influence campaign in American news media, at think tanks and on college campuses, which he will claim is more extensive than that deployed by the Russians in 2016. “Beijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies,” Mr. Pence is set to say. “As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country.” As ties between Washington and Beijing have frayed, administration officials have been airing these grievances privately for weeks. But Mr. Pence’s remarks, scheduled for 11 a.m. at the Hudson Institute in Washington, will be the first time a top American official has strung them together in a narrative of Chinese aggression, and delivered them so publicly. The White House has used Mr. Pence in this role before, notably when he attended the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and delivered a harsh message to North Korea. Weeks later, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and Mr. Trump were in talks to meet. Mr. Pence’s speech comes as tensions over the trade war appear to be spilling into other realms. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis recently canceled a trip to Beijing after the Chinese government said high-ranking military officials would not be available to meet him. The speech on Thursday is likely to roil the waters further. Mr. Pence even plans to tackle the politically charged issue of China and Taiwan. He is expected to note that the Chinese government recently persuaded three Latin American countries to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan and recognize the People’s Republic of China — something the United States did in 1979 as part of its diplomatic opening to Beijing. “While our administration will continue to respect our ‘One China’ policy, as reflected in the three joint communiqués and the Taiwan Relations Act, let me also say that Taiwan’s embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people,” Mr. Pence is scheduled to say. After his election, Mr. Trump rattled China when he spoke on the phone with Taiwan’s president and suggested that the United States might no longer abide by the One China principle. He backed off under intense pressure from Beijing. Mr. Pence is set to say that the administration drew its conclusions about China’s behavior from intelligence reports, as well as from publicly available reporting. But there is no hard evidence of Chinese election meddling — at least in the excerpts provided on Wednesday evening — beyond what Mr. Trump cited last week in New York. As Mr. Trump did, Mr. Pence will cite a multipage insert that the Chinese recently placed in The Des Moines Register. The insert, aimed at American farmers, highlights the damage caused by Mr. Trump’s trade war. “The supplement, designed to look like news articles, cast our trade policies as reckless and harmful to Iowans,” Mr. Pence is to say. “But when our ambassador tried to place his own op-ed in Chinese newspapers, describing the truth about our policies, no Chinese outlet would publish it.” Such public relations campaigns are not unusual for countries engaged in trade disputes. The White House has not claimed that China is using the techniques that Russia used in the 2016 election, like the manipulation of social media or the hacking of email accounts. Asked to compare the Chinese and Russian interference, Mr. Trump said last week, “Well, I think it’s different.” Still, citing intelligence agencies, Mr. Pence is to say: “China is targeting U.S. state and local governments and officials to exploit any divisions between federal and local levels on policy. It’s using wedge issues, like trade tariffs, to advance Beijing’s political influence.” The vice president will cite a Chinese government document, called “Propaganda and Censorship Notice,” which he will say lays out the goals of Beijing’s influence campaign. “It states that China must ‘strike accurately and carefully, splitting apart different domestic groups’ in the United States,” Mr. Pence is to say, quoting from the document.",The New York Times
2018,Pence’s China Speech Seen as Portent of ‘New Cold War’,"BEIJING — Vice President Mike Pence’s accusations in a stinging speech Thursday warning of a tougher approach toward Beijing may have been familiar to China’s leaders. But until now, such remarks were delivered in private, in fairly decorous terms, and rarely threatened direct action. The surprise this time for Beijing was the magnitude of alleged offenses piled up in one public indictment, ranging from suspected interference in American politics to China’s stomping on the freedoms of its own people. Nor had the United States ever before told China: “We will not stand down.” Publicly, China responded with a certain weariness, calling the speech “very ridiculous,” creating “something out of thin air,” but also warning that “no one can stop” the Chinese people from advancing. Behind closed doors, however, Mr. Pence’s remarks probably left few doubts among China’s leaders that Washington was embarking on a Cold War that would force the country to dig in for a prolonged multifront battle with the United States, analysts said. The leaders were no doubt angry and embarrassed that the Trump administration went all-out publicly with confrontational language that is considered unacceptable in Chinese culture, which prefers sweet phrases to disguise stern measures. Some of Mr. Pence’s declarations, like saying Washington’s trade policy most likely caused a 25 percent fall in China’s largest stock exchange in the first nine months of this year, could be dismissed as inaccurate, since trade tensions were one of several factors. Similarly, the claim that the United States “rebuilt China” over the last 25 years could be shrugged off as dubious and unfair. But it was unmistakably clear that the era of Washington holding out a hand to Beijing to become a “responsible stakeholder” in world affairs alongside the United States — a phrase used in 2005 by Robert B. Zoellick, then the deputy secretary of state — was over. “This will look like the declaration of a new Cold War, and what China may do is more important than what it will say about Pence’s speech,” said Zhang Baohui, professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. China could respond by funneling more money toward its armed forces, which Mr. Pence said spend as much as all other militaries in Asia combined. (The International Institute for Strategic Studies said last year that Asian countries combined spent about 25 percent more than China on their militaries, and that the United States spent four times what China did on its armed forces.) The vice president also singled out a near collision on Sunday in the South China Sea, where a Chinese warship cut off an American destroyer, missing it by less than 45 yards. China has kept its military budget at 1.5 percent of its economic output over the last few years. “It has a long way to go to reach the U.S. level of 3.5 to 4 percent,” Mr. Zhang said. [Discuss China’s role in the world with New York Times journalists in a new Facebook group here.] China could also reverse course on its support of the American-led effort in the United Nations that has imposed heavy sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, signaled last month that he would not buckle to Washington’s trade demands when he visited vast grain-growing areas of northeast China, stressing the need for China to be self-reliant, a policy harking back to the Cold War era of Mao Zedong 50 years ago. Chinese policymakers, following Mr. Xi’s strictures, are unlikely to give ground, said Yun Sun, a policy expert at the Stimson Center in Washington who is currently visiting China. “My comments to the Chinese are that maybe China should tone down its assertiveness to avoid further tension,” Ms. Sun said of her discussions with Chinese officials. “And the reaction I get is that ‘We don’t think we are being assertive.’” President Trump said last week that the friendship with Mr. Xi that he once was so proud of may now be over. The feeling was most likely reciprocated in the aftermath of the speech, Ms. Sun said. “I don’t think Xi still sees Trump as his friend.” China’s social media platforms, which the government rigorously censors, eliminating provocative content, bristled in shock at the severity of Mr. Pence’s speech. “Pence’s speech is really earth-shattering,” said one commenter. “This is the official speech of the U.S. I suggest every Chinese person read the whole thing. Is this another edition of the ‘Iron Curtain’ speech?” Mr. Pence’s speech was clearly directed at a domestic audience. He gave it at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group, and its timing — 11 p.m. in China — meant it probably had limited viewership in China, mostly among international affairs specialists. And it was given in the midst of a weeklong holiday in China, when the government’s most strident megaphone for foreign policy, the state-run newspaper Global Times, is not publishing. Still, the unfavorable comparison with accusations of Russian interference in American politics probably alarmed Chinese officials, said Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former member of the National Security Council in the Obama administration. “The vice president attempted to shift public scrutiny from Russia to China,” Mr. Hass said. “He asserted that Russian efforts to interfere in America’s electoral process ‘pales in comparison to what China is doing.’” But the address could reassure two nations that fear China — Japan, an important American ally, and India, a country that Washington is trying to bring closer — regional analysts said. And the tougher approach reflects a growing wariness of China among American businesses. “This has been building for a long time across different sectors in the U.S. — the military and business in particular,” said Bilahari Kausikan, a former foreign secretary for Singapore. “American business is particularly significant as it had been the stabilizing fact. But their mood has been souring for a decade or more. How the Chinese missed this, I do not know.” In Australia, another important American ally, the government has been saying many of the same things as Mr. Pence, though in more muted tones. In some ways, Australia has been viewed in Washington as a test case of what China could get away with in a country with a strong economy and Western values. The American and Australian intelligence agencies have consulted on what they see as the China threat. Allegations of Chinese meddling in Australian universities and donations to political campaigns by ethnic Chinese businessmen connected to the government in Beijing have prompted recent legislation aimed at curbing foreign interference in Australia’s domestic affairs. But the Australians have couched their new legislation in general terms, never singling out China. Mr. Pence’s harder line is likely to ignite a debate in Australia about whether it, too, should take a harder line against China. “Let’s take the heat, light, noise and excitement out of the relationship by establishing a clear, declared policy that governs our approach to the economic and strategic relationship with the Chinese state,” said Michael Shoebridge, director of defense at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Australia should follow in Mr. Pence’s footsteps, he said. But there were concerns about pushing too far. “I think Australia is broadly comfortable with the Pence approach,” said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University. “There is just a worry about it getting out of control.”",The New York Times
2018,Penguin Random House Merges Two of its Successful Publishing Lines,"Books News Penguin Random House, the largest publishing company in the United States, is merging two of its most prestigious publishing lines, Random House and the Crown Publishing Group. The new joint division will be lead by Gina Centrello, currently the president and publisher of Random House. In a memo to employees, Madeline McIntosh, the chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., said that Crown and Random House “will retain their distinct editorial identities.” The merger comes at a moment when big publishing houses are trying to adapt to the shift toward online retail and marketing. In recent years, several big publishing houses have been adding imprints, acquiring smaller publishing companies and getting larger to stay competitive. Two years ago, Hachette Book Group struck a deal to acquire Perseus, an independent publishing house, acquiring imprints like Basic Books, Avalon Travel, Da Capo, Nation Books and PublicAffairs, and in 2014, News Corporation bought the romance publisher Harlequin for $415 million. When Penguin and Random House merged in 2013, they created a behemoth, by far the biggest of “the big five” publishing houses, which also include Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan. Penguin Random House’s sales total around 4 billion annually, and they operate around 275 imprints worldwide. The move to consolidate and streamline its vast operation, while unexpected, is not surprising. Ms. McIntosh said the consolidation would enable the company to adapt to the dramatic changes in consumers’ book buying habits, with the pronounced shift to online purchasing. “Book discovery and buying patterns continue to shift, resulting in growth opportunities in the nonfiction categories in which Crown in particular already has a strong foothold: food, lifestyle, health, wellness, business, and Christian,” Ms. McIntosh wrote in a company memo. “We must invest even more aggressively in title-level and scaled marketing programs, capabilities and partnerships.” Ms. McIntosh also announced that Maya Mavjee, Crown’s president and publisher, will leave the company at the end of the year. Random House and Crown are among the most prestigious and commercially successful imprints within the larger company. With its 13 imprints, Random House publishes such best-selling authors as Ta-Nehisi Coates, George R.R. Martin and Trevor Noah, while Crown has 20 imprints, and a deep roster of blockbuster writers, including Gillian Flynn, Erik Larson, Ina Garten and Andy Weir. Crown is also publishing memoirs by President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, which will almost certainly be global best-sellers.",The New York Times
2018,Penguins and Islanders Honor Victims of Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting,"N.H.L. Roundup After an emotional pregame ceremony for their mourning city on Tuesday night, Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins channeled their emotions into a first-period flurry. The Islanders spoiled their efforts for an uplifting finish, though, with Jordan Eberle scoring twice in the second period of a 6-3 victory. The Penguins held a ceremony to honor the victims of Saturday’s synagogue shooting in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. It included an 11-second moment of silence in memory of the 11 people slain, whose names appeared on the scoreboard. There was also a ceremonial puck drop featuring two officers who were wounded in the attack. Then the Penguins came out flying, peppering goalie Robin Lehner with scoring chances, but the Islanders escaped the first period with a 2-2 tie. “We wanted to go out there and play for them,” said Crosby, who scored late in the period. “You try to recognize that and play as hard as you can to show your appreciation. Words are one thing, but you try to go out there and follow it up the same.” Islanders Coach Barry Trotz said it ranked among his team’s “worst periods of the season” and the team struggled with “heavy boots,” but he understood the circumstances. “I watched the news like everybody else, and it was absolutely cowardly what happened with the whole tragedy,” Trotz said. “But sometimes, sports teams can help a city rally, and full marks to the Penguins because they came out hard.” Eberle scored his second and third goals for the Islanders, who swept a three-game trip. Brock Nelson scored his sixth of the season and fifth goal in five games, and Tom Kuhnhackl, who won two Stanley Cups in Pittsburgh, scored his first as an Islander. Andrew Ladd and Matt Martin also scored for the Islanders, who have won four of six after starting the season 2-3. Lehner stopped 23 of 25 shots, but he did not play in the third period after sustaining what Trotz described as a strain. Thomas Greiss stopped 12 shots for the Islanders, who are playing eight of their first 11 games on the road for the first time in team history. Evgeni Malkin and Dominik Simon also scored for Pittsburgh, which had won four in a row. The Penguins outscored the opposition, 23-6, during a perfect four-game Canadian trip. “We had a lot of different emotions going through our minds to start, but the bottom line is that we wanted to find a way to get a win for a lot of reasons,” Crosby said. “Unfortunately, it didn’t happen.” LIGHTNING 8, DEVILS 3 Brayden Point had a career-high five points with a goal and four assists, defenseman Braydon Coburn scored twice and host Tampa Bay rallied from an early two-goal deficit to rout the Devils 8-3. Steven Stamkos got his 350th career goal and added two assists the Lightning, who were coming off a 3-1-1 trip. Nikita Kucherov had two goals and an assist, and Tyler Johnson and Ryan McDonagh had the other Lightning goals. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 27 saves. Miles Wood, Travis Zajac and Kyle Palmieri scored for the Devils, who started a seven-game trip. Keith Kinkaid stopped 31 of 38 shots before being replaced five minutes into the third period by Cory Schneider, who allowed a goal on six shots in his first game after off-season hip surgery. After Wood and Zajac scored in the opening 5:04, Coburn, ending a 38-game goal drought, tied it at 2-2 with first-period scores at 7:30 and 13:30.",The New York Times
2018,Pensions Get Bolder in Challenging Private Equity on Investments’ Human Cost,"Private equity firms and public pension funds have long had a symbiotic relationship: The funds supply the firms with billions of dollars to invest, and the firms deliver double-digit returns that help the funds support retired public servants. Now, pension leaders are showing a new willingness to confront private equity over the human impact of its investments. Minnesota’s pension plan temporarily halted investments in one of Toys “R” Us’s former private equity owners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, after hearing that 30,000 workers laid off amid the retailer’s bankruptcy had been denied severance. A top Oregon pension official criticized the private equity firm TPG for what he said was its serious lack of diversity, specifically citing a disparaging remark that one of the firm’s founders had made about women. And New Jersey’s pension fund moved recently to ensure that private equity firms with mortgage investments in Puerto Rico were not foreclosing on residents of the island after the havoc caused by Hurricane Maria. Pension officials said the moves were sound investment decisions that were not driven by politics. Major layoffs at companies owned by private equity firms can hurt local economies, where pensions are broadly invested. A harassment scandal could damage a private equity firm’s reputation and, by extension, a pension fund’s investment. Pensions have long shunned investments unpopular with the people they represent, often in broad categories like guns and fossil fuels. But in recent years, pension holders’ concerns have gotten more specific, and calls for the funds to take stands have increased. “We are having more contact with the public about these types of issues,” said Adam Liebtag, the acting chairman of the New Jersey State Investment Council. “They are paying closer attention. They are following the money.” New Jersey is a hotbed for social concerns over pension investments. In addition to voting to more closely monitor firms under the moratorium on foreclosures in Puerto Rico, the state recently pulled money out of a private equity firm that had acquired a so-called payday lender. “It’s a balancing act every time these situations arise,” Mr. Liebtag said. The attitudes expressed by private equity investors are also attracting scrutiny. In June, John Russell, vice chairman of the Oregon Investment Council, said sexist remarks that David Bonderman, a TPG founder, had made in his capacity as an Uber board member were “part of the behavior that basically crippled the brand.” “I would attribute that in part to lack of diversity,” Mr. Russell said, according to a recording of his remarks. A TPG spokesman said in a statement that the firm was “committed to being a leader in advancing diversity and inclusion in the industry.” “Our investors are our partners, and we welcome discussion of how TPG and the industry need to improve,” the statement continued. (Mr. Bonderman apologized for his remarks last year and resigned from the Uber board.) Today, about 35 percent of private equity’s money comes from public pensions, according to Preqin, a data firm. Private equity has continued to produce high returns, but the industry faces resistance to its high fees and profit-sharing. Some large pension funds are starting to make more investments directly and cutting out private equity firms entirely. Not wanting to alienate their funding sources further, private equity firms seem willing to concede on social issues, pension experts say. “The last thing private equity wants to do is screw this up,” said Ashby Monk, executive director of the Stanford Global Projects Center, which focuses on financial research. The shift coincides with a growing awareness among workers that they can exert influence through public pension boards, where many of the members making investment decisions represent labor unions. “Workers don’t want their pension money invested in ways that hurt other workers,” said Sarah Bloom Raskin, a fellow at Duke University and a deputy Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. “No one wants to be invested in their own decline,” she said. The collapse of Toys “R” Us has earned private equity particularly widespread criticism. The former owners had loaded the retailer up with $5 billion in debt, which helped push it into bankruptcy in September 2017. Toys “R” Us has also served as a test case for how workers exert their influence through pensions. As the bankrupt company was liquidating its stores in June, employees protested outside the New York offices of the retailer’s former owners, K.K.R., Bain and Vornado Realty Trust, demanding severance. The workers said they were unable to get through to the private equity firms, so they switched tack. Over the next three months, they traveled to investment meetings of 14 pension funds in 12 states. The employees were organized by the activist groups Rise Up Retail and the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, which was started last year. “There is a well-developed ecosystem of groups that focus on the practices of public companies,” said Jim Baker, the Stakeholder Project’s executive director. “But it’s a limited field around private equity.” The Stakeholder Project, which is partly financed by labor unions, has focused on private equity’s ownership of for-profit colleges, bail bond companies and the private prison industry. The group argued that Toys “R” Us workers deserved a portion of the financing and management fees the private equity firms collected from the retailer. The workers scored a big victory in Minnesota when Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, and the chairman of the state pension board led the effort to suspend further investments with K.K.R. in June. In Washington State, pension officials publicly questioned a top K.K.R. executive, asking if anyone had lost his or her job at the firm over the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy or had gotten a cut in pay. One pension board member suggested that the firm had a “moral obligation” to set up a fund to help the workers. The K.K.R. executive, pointing out that the firm had lost money in the bankruptcy, apologized to the pension board. Michelle Perez of Vancouver, Wash., was among those laid off when Toys “R” Us closed. Ms. Perez, 28, said she had spoken to officials with pension funds about the difficulty she faced as a single mother trying to find a new job, without severance to provide any cushion. “We are getting listened to,” she said. The toy store workers also made their case to pension funds that invest with Bain. By late summer, their efforts had begun to bear fruit: K.K.R. and Bain agreed to contribute up to $20 million between them to a hardship fund for the workers, although the final amount and terms had not been set, according to people briefed on the matter. Both firms declined to comment. Last month, Minnesota lifted the suspension on future K.K.R. investments after learning that the firm had agreed to contribute to the hardship fund. Vornado has not indicated that it planned to participate, according to the workers’ group. The firm did not respond to requests for comment. The toy store workers are still pushing to recoup all of the $75 million they are owed in severance. Lately, they have been urging New Jersey to put pressure on Solus Alternative Asset Management, which owns some of the failed retailer’s debt. New Jersey has $300 million invested with Solus. Solus has indicated that it has no plans to contribute to the fund, saying in a letter to investors that the stakeholders group was trying to “extort” investment firms. In a statement, Solus said it was working to revive the Toys “R” Us brand “in a way that we hope will provide sustainable employment for workers in the future.”",The New York Times
2018,Pentagon Grounds F-35 Fighter Jet Fleet Following Crash,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon grounded its fleet of F-35 strike fighter jets on Thursday, weeks after one crashed in South Carolina in another setback for the advanced aircraft that has long been mired in mechanical problems. The decision to halt F-35 flights stems from what the military suspects is a faulty fuel tube installed in some of the aircraft, according to a Pentagon statement. Some of the jets are already aboard a Navy ship and have carried out airstrikes in Afghanistan. Israel, Britain and other allies who have bought the F-35 from American manufacturers must also ground and inspect the fuel tubes in the jets, the statement said. There are roughly 220 F-35s in the American inventory, purchased from defense contractor Lockheed Martin. In the investigation of the F-35 crash near Beaufort, S. C., military officials gathered “initial data” that pointed to problems with the fuel tubes — and ultimately could have contributed to the Sept. 28 accident. One military official familiar with the investigation said the fuel tube has been a recurring concern with the F-35 fleet. The official said investigators were also focused on a potential fault with a spinning blade in the aircraft that is supposed to stop debris from flying into the engine. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation, said the Marine pilot involved in the crash had been flying back to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort after the aircraft had begun to malfunction. The pilot ejected safely, roughly five miles from the airfield. Though the F-35 had previously experienced other problems, such as complications with pilots’ helmets and with engine fires, last month’s incident marked the first time the jet had crashed in its 17-year history. “The primary goal following any mishap is the prevention of future incidents,” Joe Dellavedova, the public affairs director for the office that oversees the F-35 program, said in the Pentagon statement. “We will take every measure to ensure safe operations while we deliver, sustain and modernize the F-35 for the warfighter and our defense partners.” Mr. Dellavedova said that inspections of the fuel tubes are expected to be completed within the next two days. Jets with tubes that are cleared will continue flying. In 2016, weeks after the Pentagon said that the F-35 was ready for some combat operations, top officials raised concerns, writing in a memo that the jet might be “not effective and not suitable across the required mission areas and against currently fielded threats” as currently configured. The F-35 has often been called one of the most expensive weapons programs in history; each jet costs between $80 million and just over $100 million. It costs roughly $50,000 each hour to fly the aircraft, which is capable of avoiding enemy radar and uses a highly advanced software system. By contrast, some of the American military’s older jets cost around $10,000 per hour to fly.",The New York Times
2018,"People, Places and Things to Know: Feminist Art That’s Also Furniture, Patterned Bags and More","People, Places and Things T’s cultural compendium of what’s new. In the early ’90s, while she was living in Paris, the Korean artist Seulgi Lee received a gift from a friend — a blanket quilted using the nubi method, a traditional Korean technique characterized by distinctive, tightly spaced rows of stitches. She was instantly drawn to the blanket’s bright colors and parallel lines of thread, which reminded her of a rice field. After years of failing to track down similar pieces, she decided to make her own, working closely with artisans from Tongyeong, South Korea. In 2017, she produced a collection of richly colored cashmere nubi for Hermès. On November 15, Seoul’s Gallery Hyundai will unveil her newest works: silk canvases hand sewn with color-blocked geometric forms inspired by such droll Korean proverbs as “eat the rice cake lying down” and “even a straw sandal has its pair.” The show will also feature a selection of woven sculptures she created with a cooperative of female basket makers in the remote Oaxacan village of Santa María Ixcatlán. Though the town’s indigenous language is all but lost, Lee says, its residents still know how to weave palm leaves. “We were inventing new shapes and naming them,” she said, “to allow an ancient language to resurface.” — MERRELL HAMBLETON The painstaking technique of threading tiny gem beads to make an elaborate piece of high jewelry — used for the chrysoberyls and tourmalines in this Cartier bracelet, which is crowned with a 65-carat cushion-cut rubellite — first evolved in India at least a thousand years ago. Threading has, over the past century, become one of Cartier’s signatures, evidence of the inspiration the Paris-based house has always found on the subcontinent: Jacques Cartier, a son of the founder, traveled to India in 1911 to research jewels and cultivate the business of the maharajahs. These days, a small group of specially trained Cartier artisans cull, cut and polish the perfect stones for threading, now done on microbraided Kevlar instead of cotton or silk. The weight, shape and feel of each bead dictates which of several intricate knots should hold it in place — it is a delicate art of both touch and imagination.

It’s for a man to grab and pull!” she said, taking a drag on her prop cigarette. “A drawer has a knob. A woman has two knobs!” Forty years ago, the French artist Nicola L. made the same joke — albeit a little more wryly — with her sculptural furniture. “La Femme Commode,” which she first produced in 1969 and continued to make in various colors (sunflower yellow, coral red) until 2014, is a lacquered wood cabinet shaped like a woman, with eyes, mouth, breasts, bellybutton and even clitoris all serving as tiny knobs to different-size drawers. Next month, it will go on view at Manhattan’s Arsenal Contemporary, along with several other pieces by Nicola L. — now 81 and retired in Los Angeles — as well as a selection of contemporary works by artists including Chloe Wise, Nadia Belerique and Ambera Wellmann, all created to be in conversation with Nicola L.’s oeuvre. Born in Morocco, Nicola L. arrived in New York City in 1966, taking a room at the Chelsea Hotel, where Andy Warhol was filming “Chelsea Girl” with Nico. Though less famous than her neighbors, she nonetheless carved a path for herself as a genre-crossing talent with something to say. In addition to her anthropomorphic sculptures, she’s known for outlandish performance pieces such as “Red Coat” (1973), an egalitarian jacket for 11 people to wear at once, creating the experience of sharing the same skin. Gallery goers can look forward to a vinyl sofa shaped like an oversize foot, canvas flags with holes for a wearer’s extremities and a long oak plank of a coffee table outlined in feminine curves. All reveal the way Nicola L. investigated the body, movement and the objectification of women, especially within the domestic space. In her case, the underlying message seems to be a lighthearted warning: Don’t push too many of our buttons. — THESSALY LA FORCE Embellished fall carryalls that pack a punch.

In 1938, Frank Lloyd Wright, then 70, bought desert land at the foot of a mountain outside Phoenix to build Taliesin West, a winter home for himself and his assembly of acolytes. There, he created some of the most daring furniture of his career, including the 1949 chair that would come to be known as the Origami. Crafted from a single sheet of plywood, the chair, officially called Taliesin 1, was (and remains) a marvel of balance-defying geometry. Now, Cassina, which manufactured the first commercial version in the late 1980s, is releasing a new limited edition as part of its ongoing collaboration with the Wright Foundation. Available in three unmistakably contemporary shades — burgundy, midnight blue and “petrol green” (pictured here) — of tinted lacquer cherry veneer, with leather upholstery dyed to match, the new Origami is slightly more cushioned and a tiny bit more reclined.

2018,Peru Opposition Leader Keiko Fujimori Is Arrested in Corruption Inquiry,"LA PAZ, Bolivia — Keiko Fujimori, a powerful Peruvian politician whose father ruled the country in the 1990s, was arrested in a money laundering investigation on Wednesday, calling into question the future of the political family and their right-wing populist movement. The arrest came just days after the country’s Supreme Court ordered her father, former President Alberto Fujimori, back to prison on a human rights abuse conviction, overruling the presidential pardon that had freed him in December. Ms. Fujimori was detained at the chief prosecutor’s office, where she had been called to testify in her own case, said her lawyer, Giuliana Loza, who called the arrest “arbitrary.” Prosecutors have been investigating whether Ms. Fujimori, the opposition leader, accepted illegal campaign contributions during her 2011 and 2016 presidential campaigns. About 100 of her supporters gathered at the courthouse to protest her arrest. Ms. Fujimori, who is considered a flight risk, will initially be held for at least 10 days while prosecutors consider filing formal charges. In a letter that she posted on Twitter on Wednesday, she denounced her arrest as unfair. “Persecution is disguised as justice in our country,” she wrote. The arrest orders for Ms. Fujimori and her father are a dramatic turn of events for one of Peru’s most powerful families, which governed Peru in the 1990s with a brand of right-wing populism they were seeking to reestablish in the country. Ms. Fujimori’s father was elected president in 1990 before he suspended the country’s Constitution and ruled as a dictator. Though sent to jail on charges that he had been involved in the murder of at least 25 people during those years, Mr. Fujimori remained deeply popular among many Peruvians as his administration was also credited with improving the economy, investing in infrastructure and defeating left-wing groups that engaged in bloody conflict with the government. Ms. Fujimori has become one of Peru’s most powerful politicians, commanding the Popular Force party, which controls the largest share of seats in the country’s Congress. Many analysts feared that her rise — which included an attempt to impeach Peru’s previous president, who eventually resigned — would do lasting damage to the country’s democratic institutions. The recent detentions of Ms. Fujimori and her father have now led some to believe that the opposite may be true. “I think it’s a major point of weakening for Fujimorismo,” said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, referring to the political movement that bears the family name. Ms. Fujimori has been the subject of a number of corruption investigations in recent years, including inquiries into her campaign financing, accusations of money laundering and questions regarding her ties to the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, which has admitted paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes for construction projects in Latin America. Public anger turned against both Ms. Fujimori and investigators this July, when tapes in which judicial officials could be heard planning unofficial meetings with a “Señora K” were leaked to the press. Critics said that the nickname referred to Ms. Fujimori and that the officials were looking to cut an illicit deal with her. The ensuing scandal resulted in the firing and resignation of many top judiciary officials. Mr. Dargent, the political scientist, said prosecutors were now under increased pressure to show that they are clean of political influence — a possible motivation for Wednesday’s arrest. There have been other signs of weakness within Ms. Fujimori’s party, and within the family, in recent months. In local elections on Sunday, voters shut the party out of most mayoral offices. Ms. Fujimori split with her brother, Kenji Fujimori, a former congressman, over an impeachment attempt against former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who pardoned their father in an attempt to avoid being ousted from office. Ms. Fujimori led a second push to impeach Mr. Kuczynski this March, resulting in his resignation and further estrangement from her brother, who had supported the former president. Their Popular Force party has been split since.",The New York Times
2018,Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande Split Up: Your Monday Pop Culture Cheat Sheet,"What would you like to see here? Email us at popculture@nytimes.com. Hello! Welcome to your daily roundup of what’s going on in pop culture. Season 4 of “Schitt’s Creek” came to Netflix this weekend and in plowing through the episodes I was reminded of how much I love this sweet and salty Canadian show. It’s rare television about terrible people that treats them with a lot of affection, and the costume designer deserves every award going. Comfort viewing of the highest order. I am very inspired by the French artist Sophie Calle, who hit up Pharrell Williams, Laurie Anderson and Bono, among others, to help write a 37-track album in memory of her dead cat, Souris, The Wall Street Journal reports. She’s also putting on a show in Paris where you can listen to the album and look at portraits of Souris, which means “mouse.” I look forward to giving my cat a funeral in a fancy Parisian art gallery, too. • Whether or not you followed the coverage of the meeting between Kanye West and President Trump last week, watching the “Saturday Night Live” recreation is a delight.

[CNN] • In a charming new installment of “doing things with celebrities and writing about it,” Joshua Rivera went golfing with Michael Peña for GQ. The pair’s experiences on the course ended up mirroring Peña’s experiences in Hollywood. • As someone who finds it hard to sit through horror movies, the trend for immersive horror experiences is very confusing to me. But devotees of extreme haunts repeatedly pay real money to be buried alive, pushed off a balcony or vomited on. “I feel like I am living my life at its fullest,” said one devotee, which, well, I suppose is hard to argue with. There’s a lot to love in this week’s Playlist. I’ve been listening to “Gut Feeling” by the British R&B singer Ella Mai on repeat. It’s all “Stevie Wonder-tinged jazzy piano chords,” to quote the Times critic Jon Pareles, a super-smooth way to capture those first moments of romantic doubt. Spotted in the background on “60 Minutes,” it shows a very svelte President Trump having a drink with past Republican presidents.

2018,"Peter Rice, Fox’s Un-Hollywood TV Boss, Is Getting More Say Over What You Watch","Hollywood Hollywood executives are not so different from the stars they employ. They want to be seen in the right booths at the right restaurants. They work the room at the after-parties on awards nights. And they would rather die than drop a spot on The Hollywood Reporter’s annual power list. Peter Rice, who was named the chairman of Walt Disney Television on Monday, avoids that kind of showboating. Mr. Rice, 51, became the president of 21st Century Fox a little more than a year ago, after working at various Fox divisions for nearly three decades. He might have stayed indefinitely, if it were not for the Walt Disney Company’s surprise acquisition of the majority of the Rupert Murdoch-owned company, a deal that shareholders approved over the summer. When regulators sign off on the $71.3 billion transaction, expected in the next few months, Mr. Rice will take charge of the combined television assets of two companies that were immense even before they merged. Although he will become perhaps the most powerful executive in the industry — he will oversee a broadcast network, a collection of cable channels and an enormous studio — his understated demeanor is unlikely to change. Associates described him as “even-tempered,” “affable” and “cryptic.” During work meetings, he favors the Socratic method, and he is not afraid of silence, often allowing long pauses that some lieutenants describe as intimidating and intentional. He seems most at ease when he is marking up the erasable whiteboard walls that line his office, or spending time with his wife and children at their home in Hidden Hills, a gated suburb in the far reaches of the San Fernando Valley. Disney’s announcement of Mr. Rice’s new job specified that he will report directly to Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive. For the first time in his career, Mr. Rice’s boss will be someone other than a Murdoch. The appointment also means his name is very likely to be bandied about in one of Hollywood’s favorite parlor games: Who will run the Magic Kingdom when Mr. Iger’s contract comes to an end in three years? If that kind of talk is to gain any traction, though, Mr. Rice would have to distinguish himself at a company that usually promotes from within. He would also have to prove himself superior to a pair of longtime Disney executives in their 50s: Kevin Mayer, who runs the company’s portfolio of streaming services and international media operations, and Bob Chapek, the chairman of its theme parks and consumer products. The job won’t be easy. Mr. Rice will be responsible for the countless hours of television content filling the schedules of the broadcast and cable networks that have long been in the Disney family, as well as the various Fox channels that were already part of his purview. That means ABC, Fox, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, the National Geographic Channel and FX, not to mention the two companies’ combined TV studios, leaving Mr. Rice in charge of an exceedingly wide range of fare — everything from “Atlanta” to “Puppy Dog Pals.” His brief will include fixing ABC, which has consistently finished in last place among the four broadcast networks, and improving the fortunes of the sagging Disney Channel. Disney is also counting on Mr. Rice and his team to find shows that will attract subscribers to Hulu — Disney will be the majority owner when the deal is official — and a new streaming service scheduled to go live next year. While Disney has signaled that it will welcome the programs it is to inherit as part of its purchase of Fox, something like the FX series “American Horror Story” — which marketed its new season with a grotesque image of a devil’s hand reaching for a baby — may be a tricky fit for the family-friendly empire. This is a company, after all, that uses songs like “Under the Sea” from “The Little Mermaid” as the hold music on its telephone system. Tom Rothman, a former Fox executive who runs Sony’s Motion Picture Group, said he believed Mr. Rice is up for the challenge. “Peter can do that nearly impossible thing, which is to mix genuine creative vision with business acumen,” Mr. Rothman said. “Every significant decision in these senior jobs involves both of those skills, and that kind of integrated intelligence is really rare.” Mr. Rice, who has seldom granted interviews, declined to comment for this article. He grew up in South London and went to work for Mr. Murdoch in 1987, when he was a summer intern at 20th Century Fox. “When I left to return to college at the end of the summer,” he wrote in Variety in 2014, “I never wanted to work anywhere else.” After graduating from the University of Nottingham in 1989 with a degree in American studies, Mr. Rice joined the 20th Century Fox marketing department and later worked as an executive on blockbusters like “Independence Day” and the first “X-Men” film. Many of his colleagues have noted his easy rapport with the Murdochs. And a family connection is what led to him to Fox. “The boss had a huge admiration for Peter’s dad,” said David Hill, a former top Fox Sports executive. He added that Rupert Murdoch “loves thoroughbreds, and obviously understands blood lines.” Mr. Rice’s father, Tom Rice, was an official with the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, which cooperated with Mr. Murdoch in 1986 as he defied organized labor during his ultimately successful efforts to move the printing and publishing operations of his News International company from Fleet Street to London’s Wapping district. A searing event in British press and labor history, the move set off violent protests. Afterward, Tom Rice entered the Murdoch corporate fold, eventually becoming the managing director of News International in Ireland. He died in 2009. While his father worked for Mr. Murdoch in Dublin, Mr. Rice was on the rise in the mogul’s Los Angeles operation, helping to reel in talented up-and-comers like the director Baz Luhrmann. In 2000, Fox named Mr. Rice the president of its specialty film division, Fox Searchlight. He turned the unit into an Oscar and box-office superpower, delivering one idiosyncratic hit after another, most made for budgets of under $15 million — an achievement that remains his biggest. The movies released during his Fox Searchlight tenure included “Little Miss Sunshine,” “Napoleon Dynamite,” “Sideways,” “28 Days Later,” “The Last King of Scotland,” “Slumdog Millionaire” and “Juno.” “His support can feel like prevailing winds in your sails,” said Jason Reitman, who directed “Juno,” which took in $231 million worldwide in 2007 and was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning one for Diablo Cody’s screenplay. “I’ve never had an unthoughtful conversation with him.” For much of the last decade, Mr. Rice has been in charge of the company’s TV assets, not including Fox News. He increased the budget for FX, and it attracted top creators like Donald Glover (“Atlanta”). At the same time, the Fox TV studio created hits for Fox channels and other networks, including “The Americans” (FX), “Empire” (Fox), “This Is Us” (NBC), “Modern Family” (ABC) and “Homeland” (Showtime). “He starts off at 20th Century Fox as a cadet and he just gets bigger and bigger,” said Mr. Hill, the former Fox executive, who credited Mr. Rice for having a deft touch with actors, producers and directors, as well as a “total understanding of the underpinning revenue.” His résumé is not without blemishes, however. In 2006, while running Fox Searchlight, he created a film subdivision geared for young adults, Fox Atomic. Its few successes, like the horror sequel “28 Weeks Later,” were eclipsed by a parade of duds: “The Rocker,” “Miss March,” “12 Rounds.” Fox Atomic went up in a mushroom cloud in 2009. Another mark against him is that the Fox broadcast network has had trouble finding sustainable hits in recent years. Mr. Rice remained at Fox even as other companies sought him out. After the Sony Corporation talked to him last year as part of its search for a new head of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Fox gave Mr. Rice a five-year contract extension and promoted him to president of 21st Century Fox, a job that did not include oversight of Fox’s film companies. What Mr. Rice did not know at the time was that Mr. Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, had already entered into talks with Disney. Taking his overall record into account, his next employer is betting that Mr. Rice’s approach to television has a better chance at success than the plan Disney had in place before it agreed to buy Fox. Mr. Rice will not be going it alone on his journey from Fox to Disney: Accompanying him will be John Landgraf, the head of FX; Dana Walden, the co-chief executive of the Fox television group; and Gary E. Knell, the head of National Geographic Partners. Disney is counting on Team Rice to deliver hits at a time when the competition has never been greater, particularly in children’s television, now that Netflix has become a major draw for young viewers. Navigating Disney’s buttoned-up culture may be a challenge for some Fox alumni, who will leave behind the less structured working environment fostered by Mr. Murdoch. But Mr. Rice’s general bearing — keep your head down and your ego in check — is probably a good fit for an organization that values executives who do not carry themselves as if they are bigger than the company they work for.",The New York Times
2018,"Pets Are Like Family. But as Health Costs Rise, Few Are Insured That Way.","Wealth Matters Selling pet products to humans is big business. Last year, according to the American Pet Products Association, owners spent nearly $70 billion on their pets. While much of that money is spent on pet paraphernalia, some of the biggest, and most unexpected, costs are for drugs and medical procedures as pets live longer and occupy a more central role in homes. By one estimate, owners spend $9,000 to more than $13,000 for medical treatments over their pets’ lifetimes. “Things have changed dramatically over the past 30 to 40 years with how people are viewing pets,” said Dr. Craig A. Clifford, a medical oncologist and director of clinical studies at Hope Veterinary Specialists in Malvern, Pa. “Thirty years ago, we called it the Snoopy generation, where the dog lived outside and wasn’t a big part of the family.” Now, Dr. Clifford said, we live in the Brian generation, a reference to the dog on “Family Guy,” who walks on his hind legs, martini in paw, and chats with his family. “People are eating dinner with them and having cocktails with them,” he said, with a laugh. “That’s a paradigm shift about how pets are perceived.” That kind of relationship can lead to some difficult decisions. While a new collar may be a happy expense, emergency surgery to remove a sock lodged in a dog’s intestine is not. And the cost for such surgery can stretch to many thousands of dollars, blowing up a monthly budget. Consider Lord Tigglesworth, known as Tiggy to family and friends. He was living a fine feline existence, as a fat cat with doting parents in Wilmington, Del. A few months ago, he began vomiting and eating less. Claire Anderson and Andrew Logan, his owners (or pet parents, as some call themselves), began to worry. At first, they thought he just needed some teeth removed, so they had that done. “He was incredibly low maintenance in terms of any health stuff,” Ms. Anderson said of her 8-year-old cat. “He had lost seven pounds, and he only weighed 18 pounds to begin with. When he lost the weight, that’s when I knew it was more.” It turned out that Lord Tigglesworth had cancer in his gastrointestinal tract. The treatment was effective, but he still didn’t eat. And giving him a pill — not an easy feat with any cat — was stressful for him and his owners. The couple’s veterinarian prescribed an ointment called Mirataz, whose active ingredient, mirtazapine, was originally used to treat depression in humans but has a side effect of increasing appetite. Mr. Logan said he and his wife had already spent $6,000 on Lord Tigglesworth’s care, so they didn’t flinch at paying about $30 for a two-week supply. “It’s been pricey,” Mr. Logan said. “But if you were to annualize this over our time together, it’s been cheap.” Unlike humans, only about 10 percent of dogs and 5 percent of cats are covered by medical insurance, according to a survey by the pet association. And since 2015, the costs of veterinary services have risen over 10 percent for medical treatments and 5 percent for regular checkups, according to the Nationwide/Purdue University Veterinary Price Index. “It’s not what veterinarians are charging,” Dr. Carol McConnell, vice president and chief veterinary officer for Nationwide, said. “It’s more what consumers are choosing to pay.” Mirataz is made by Kindred Biosciences, a small pet pharmaceutical company in Burlingame, Calif. The company introduced the drug, its first, in August because nine million cats in the United States have unintended weight loss but only a third of them are treated with appetite stimulants, Kindred’s chief operating officer, Denise Bevers, said. One reason is the difficulty of giving pills or compounded liquids to cats. Kindred formulated the appetite stimulant so an owner can rub it into the cat’s ear while both are relaxing. The pet pharma field has been growing at an estimated rate of 5 percent a year, to nearly $6 billion in 2016, the latest figure available. Companies producing drugs for pets include Zoetis, which was spun out from Pfizer in 2013; Elanco, formerly part of Eli Lilly; and Merck Animal Health. While there are more cats than dogs in the United States — 94 million vs. 89 million — dog owners are a richer market for several reasons. Dogs are generally outside more than cats. They’re active with other dogs, which means they get hurt. Dogs are also liable to bring diseases inside through fleas and ticks, or to eat something that gives them a parasite. But veterinarians note that dogs are also easier to treat. Have a pill? Cover it in peanut butter or wrap it in deli meat and chances are the dog will scarf it down in seconds. Try to give a cat a pill and the race is on to catch the feline before she disappears under a couch for the rest of the night. The big drug makers have released drugs to deal with common ailments — fleas and ticks and itchy skin, known as contact dermatitis. But they have had to be price sensitive in a way they are not with human drugs. Dr. Elaine Wexler-Mitchell, a veterinarian who owns the Cat Care Clinic in Orange, Calif., said she often cut up a human pill for her feline patients, recalling that a lot of owners didn’t want to use a hypothyroidism drug made specifically for cats because it was more expensive. A three-month supply was $35. Pet insurance would seem an answer to this. The industry grew 17.5 percent last year, but to only 1.83 million pets, according to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association. (The first pet policy in the United States was issued in 1982 by Veterinary Pet Insurance for the dog portraying Lassie, the canine star.) Nationwide, which acquired Veterinary Pet Insurance in 2009, assesses the costs of pet insurance in much the same way it assesses cars: different rates for different breeds, ages and geography. The monthly cost to insure a 1-year-old Labrador retriever in New York City ranges from $36.65 for a basic, high-deductible emergency plan to $111.19 for whole pet insurance, which covers 90 percent of all preventive and medical care. In Manhattan, Kan., insuring the same dog ranges from $26.65 to $72.51 a month. A 1-year-old shorthair cat costs $20.15 to $49.10 a month in New York and $14.66 to $32.02 a month in Manhattan, Kan. “The cost of care for us is also related to age,” Dr. McConnell said. “It’s the reverse of the car — the older the animal gets, the more it costs.” But policies like that are intended to cover all veterinary expenses — well visits, emergencies, dental work and prescriptions — and not single out a service the way human health insurance does. Still, the ultimate arbiters for many of these treatments are not the specialists but the neighborhood veterinarians. And sometimes they say enough is enough. “Zoetis has done a lot for allergies, and Merck has a new flu vaccine out,” said Dr. Nolan Zeide, a veterinarian at Bull’s Head Pet Hospital in Stamford, Conn. “With new drugs, we look at the practicality of it and how safe it is. Then we ask: ‘How much is this going to cost? Is it going to be of good benefit to you, or it’s going to be a waste of your money?’”",The New York Times
2018,Pets Shed Constantly. Here’s How to Keep Up.,"Because pets are always shedding, the tireless robot vacuum is the best vacuum for pet hair — but a great dust mop works well, too. If you are a pet owner, it’s likely you know this: pets shed constantly. A typical house cat can shed up to 75,000 hairs a day. If you are a typical human, you probably also know that you lack the time and the will to keep up with that kind of cleaning. As a result, pet hair builds up on floors and rugs, which can go from annoying to disgusting in a matter of days. Many vacuum manufacturers offer special “pet hair” models, but Wirecutter, a New York Times Company that reviews products, has spent hundreds of hours of testing and confirmed that any decent vacuum can handle any amount of pet hair. Pet owners’ willingness to clean is the real limiting factor. So what are the best options? Because robot vacuums work autonomously and can be set to clean daily or even multiple times a day, they’re better than any other type of vacuum at keeping pet hair from accumulating. “Before the Roomba, we vacuumed once a week,” said Alex Arpaia, a staff writer at Wirecutter. “We run the Roomba two to three times a week, and there is a clear difference.” She said it’s also helpful for picking up errant litter. (See more in this guide to the best vacuums for pet hair.) But robot vacuums have quirks that take getting used to. Much like the animals they’re cleaning up after, robot vacuums have a voracious appetite for unwholesome objects: loose electrical cords, socks, underwear, bits of food, balls of yarn, piles of excrement. Unlike pets, however, the vacuums are programmed to shut themselves off upon ingestion, and fixing them is as simple as removing the blockage — no tools (or vet trip) required. In any case, new owners quickly learn to keep such items off the floor. And although robot vacuums are effective on most area rugs and short-pile carpets, their suction isn’t as powerful as that of manual vacuums. On top of that, they’re totally ineffective on high-pile rugs and carpets. So you should still have a manual vacuum on hand for occasional deep cleaning. Wirecutter’s guide to upright and canister vacuums looks at multiple models. If you’re not ready to take the plunge on a robovac, and if your home mostly has hard floors, a good dust mop is a great option. Wirecutter’s pick is the O-Cedar Dual-Action Microfiber Flip Mop, from its guide to brooms, dustpans, and dust mops. Its 18-inch-wide head sweeps a broad swath of floor with each pass, so cleaning a large room takes only a few minutes. The microfiber material is a magnet for pet hair and is washable and durable. The mop’s low-profile head and its long, lightweight handle allow it to reach all the way under large sofas and king-size beds — places where pet hair tends to accumulate, and where manual vacuums don’t reach. Microfiber cloths are excellent for wiping pet hair off furniture. Chemical Guys makes highly regarded car-care products — Wirecutter recommends the company’s microfiber washing mitt in its guide to washing, waxing, and detailing your vehicle — and a 12-pack of its 16-inch-square towels costs less than $20. As with the mop head, you should wash these towels only with non-bleach detergent and avoid using fabric softener, which leaves behind a film that compromises microfiber’s performance. Robot vacuums work only on floors, and most hand-held vacuums are too weak to clean pet hair off upholstery because they lack a rolling brush head. The attachments that come with a canister or upright vacuum work great, but a cordless stick vacuum makes the chore quicker and easier. These cordless vacuums are almost as powerful as their corded floor-vacuum counterparts but are much lighter and easier to handle. Wirecutter’s current top pick is the Dyson V7 because it delivers strong suction and long battery life, and because it handled better than anything else they tested. So long as you mount the charger in a convenient location, a cordless stick vacuum remains ready to grab and go for any little mess. As a result, many people find themselves doing frequent quick cleanups instead of letting messes build up. And that helps keep pet hair from accumulating on floors, too.

2018,Pfizer’s Departing C.E.O. Will Be Known for the Deals He Didn’t Complete,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them._________ Ian Read is stepping down after eight years as chief executive of Pfizer. During his tenure, Mr. Read helped reshape one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies. Through deal making, he focused the company on its core business like vaccines and other specialized treatments. He acquired companies like Hospira, a maker of complicated generic versions of biotech treatments, and spun off divisions, such as an animal health business that is now the separately traded Zoetis. But his time there may be best remembered for two deals that he failed to strike that made Pfizer a target for public criticism over corporate taxes. His pursuits of AstraZeneca, the British drug maker, and Allergan, the Botox manufacturer that is headquartered in Dublin, both failed. AstraZeneca repeatedly rebuffed Pfizer’s approaches. And the Obama administration tightened tax rules enough to make Pfizer’s bid for Allergan financially unattractive. Neither deal was born solely out of product necessity. Instead, the takeover bids were meant in large part to help Pfizer move its corporate headquarters abroad — and shrink its tax bills. Mr. Read, an accountant by training, was outspoken in his defense of such deals. The United States tax code, which taxed American companies’ profits worldwide and at a higher rate than other countries, left his business at a disadvantage to foreign rivals, he argued. He said it was in his shareholders’ best interest to try and get the company the equivalent of a new passport. “Our competitors don’t have to pay the penalty imposed on U.S. corporations bringing earnings back to America,” he wrote in a 2016 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. “We can invest less — because of a broken tax system.” The attempted deals drew anger from both ends of the political spectrum. Hillary Rodham Clinton decried such transactions, which she said eroded the tax base. Donald Trump called Pfizer’s bid for Allergan “disgusting.” In late 2017, the Trump administration overhauled the American tax code. The changes reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and lowered the tax rate on overseas earnings that were repatriated to the United States. Pfizer took advantage. In January 2018, it announced that it would pay $15 billion in taxes over the next eight years to bring its overseas profits back to the United States. Mr. Read finally got a little of what he had sought all along.",The New York Times
2018,Philip Pullman’s ‘Daemon Voices’ Casts an Entrancing Spell,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Daemon Voices:On Stories and StorytellingBy Philip Pullman.Illustrated. 455 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30. “Energy, pure untrammeled strength and vigor, an energy so prodigious that it throws off vivid sparks of glee and gives out spontaneous flares of combustion.” This is what Philip Pullman, author of the beloved trilogy of children’s novels “His Dark Materials,” identifies as a quality Charles Dickens possessed “in abundance.” Pullman has an oversize portion of this infectious energy himself, to judge by “Daemon Voices: On Stories and Storytelling,” a new collection of his essays and talks. Taken in long swigs, “Daemon Voices” can be overwhelming, a torrent of enthusiasm for science, art, music and literature. But moderate doses act much like the story Lucy Pevensie reads in a magical book in “The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,” a novel by Pullman’s bête noire and occasional inspiration, C. S. Lewis. Like that story, and like Pullman’s own fiction, these essays cast a spell “for the refreshment of the spirit.” To read them is to be invigorated by the company of a joyfully wide-ranging, endlessly curious and imaginative mind. More than any other author of children’s fiction during its current golden age, Pullman has demonstrated that novels of ideas aren’t just for readers aged 16 and up. Patterned after Milton’s “Paradise Lost” and inspired by the poetry of William Blake, “His Dark Materials” lays claim to an epic stage. The story spans multiple universes, including the land of the dead, and wrestles with faith, skepticism, religious tyranny, scientific inquiry and the nature of consciousness. Yet the telling is anything but ponderous. Pullman’s heroine, 11-year-old Lyra Belacqua, sprints through a series of thrilling adventures featuring witches, canal-faring gypsies and talking armored polar bears, culminating in a confrontation with a false, decrepit god followed by a four-handkerchief denouement. Pullman, who describes himself as a “thoroughgoing materialist,” provides a counterpoint to authors like Lewis and his friend J. R. R. Tolkien, believers who infused their children’s fiction with Christian themes. The success of “His Dark Materials” made Pullman one of Britain’s prominent atheists. Many of the pieces in “Daemon Voices” originated as talks delivered to such gatherings as the Sea of Faith National Conference or as debates with religious figures, including Richard Harries, the bishop of Oxford, the city where Pullman lives and where several of his books are set. It’s striking both how many of the essays in this collection originated as lectures or other forms of public speech and how many were commissioned by organizations of a religious bent. I once saw Pullman deliver a talk on the subject of religion and education at the University of East Anglia (it appears in this collection under the title “Talents and Virtues”), and afterward I asked the clergyman responsible for inviting him why he’d chosen a famous atheist. He looked at me with a benign and slightly pitying patience and replied, “In order to come to views, you don’t just listen to people you agree with.” This is the Anglican Church in which Pullman was raised (his grandfather was a parish priest), and however heated his remarks about organized religion have been, that spirit of courteous, open-minded inquiry prevails in the essays here. But the more important legacy Pullman inherited from his grandfather was a sense of story, rooted in the Bible, that hefty collection of tales. Storytelling fascinates Pullman far more than religion does. In these essays and talks, he asks himself (and by extension his audience) if the ability to spin yarns is innate or learned and if narrative, like matter, can be broken down into its fundamental particles. “Stories aren’t made of language,” he observes, noting that it’s possible to tell a story without using a single word. “Perhaps they’re made of life.” That line comes from a talk Pullman delivered in 1997. By 2007, speaking at Trinity College in Oxford, he’d decided that stories are composed of events, divisible into “the smallest events we can find.” This prompts a delightful jaunt through a series of artworks, ranging from Vermeer to Charles Addams, each depicting someone pouring liquid, and each image a “little original skeletal story” that can be made to signify everything from the placidly domestic to the mock-Gothic to the very font of life itself. This essay, “Poco a Poco,” then tilts upward from its browsing survey of art and illustration to round on a sudden, euphoric vista. When it’s going well, Pullman explains, story-making feels to him “like discovery, not invention. It feels as if the story I’m writing already exists, in some Platonic way, and that I’m privileged from time to time to gain access to it.” These moments of exhilaration, he confesses, arrive “like a blessing,” even if he doesn’t believe a supreme being has bestowed them. And it feels to him that instead of being allotted to him stingily — “just a drop or two” — stories come to him from “an inexhaustible source of strength, truth, meaning, encouragement, blessedness” that can never run dry. It was no arbitrary choice, the reader then realizes, to explore images of pouring. “Daemon Voices” includes appreciations of Milton and Blake, as well as of Dickens, and Phillipa Pearce, author of the children’s classic “Tom’s Midnight Garden.” It closes with “The Republic of Heaven,” a 2000 lecture calling for a new “myth” — that is, a meaning-constructing narrative — for a secular, egalitarian understanding of humanity and the universe, and how that might be expressed in children’s literature. If that sounds like a tall order for kids’ books, this is in fact the essence of Pullman’s appeal: He takes children seriously. He addresses them as intelligent, moral beings struggling to make sense of the world. He writes clearly when writing for them because that’s how he writes for everyone, and he assumes that what interests him can readily be made interesting to them, as well. As a result, his novels and nonfiction have also found many adult admirers. But perhaps the most stirring essay in “Daemon Voices” is the foreword Pullman wrote for a new edition of “Folk Tales of Britain,” edited by Katharine M. Briggs, who in 1970 assembled what Pullman describes as “the most authoritative” collection of the nation’s folk tales. In a handful of pages, this essay captures Pullman’s spirit of play (“a tale that goes under the magnificent title of ‘The Cellar of Blood.’ Who could resist that?”) and his respect for what has often been dismissed as a rudimentary form of culture. He compares the variations each taleteller works on a traditional story to the improvisations of a jazz musician embellishing a familiar song. And he cautions against the belief that Britain’s stories, like its culture, should ever be fixed — in print or otherwise — unchanging. To keep old stories alive, he argues, we must find ways to retell them in new ways, as Benjamin Zephaniah does in his “dub poetry version of the strange old tale ‘Tam Lin,’ set in a world of clubs and D.J.s and sex in the back of a car and immigrants without official papers.” Treasures “should not be hoarded. This is for spending. And the strangest thing of all about this sort of treasure is that the more you give away, the more you have left.” If this is the Republic of Heaven, who wouldn’t want to be part of it?",The New York Times
2018,"Philippines Wins New Term on U.N. Rights Council, Drawing Outrage","MANILA — The Philippines has won another term on the United Nations Human Rights Council, a move condemned by international groups and officials as “unconscionable” but praised by Philippine officials as a “vindication” for a nation maligned around the world for President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal drug war. The country won a three-year term on Friday at the United Nations General Assembly, becoming one of 18 member states to join the 47-seat council through 2021. The vote was 192 to 165, the Philippine foreign secretary, Alan Peter Cayetano, said. Human Rights Watch accused the Philippine president of overseeing a “killing frenzy” and said the vote for the country to retain its seat on the council risked undermining the body’s credibility and effectiveness. The Philippines has been “undergoing a human rights crisis” that could amount to crimes against humanity, said Louis Charbonneau, Human Rights Watch’s director at the United Nations. “The killings continue daily and have spread to cities and provinces outside the capital, Manila,” Mr. Charbonneau said. “The Duterte administration has sought to quell dissent and criticism of the drug war by jailing, threatening and harassing critics.” Mr. Cayetano characterized the vote as a new mandate that would allow the Philippines to prove to its detractors that the government valued human rights. “We are really greatly honored as this is a vindication that fake news and baseless accusations have no place in modern-day human rights discussions,” Mr. Cayetano said in a statement on Saturday. “We thank human rights advocates around the world but also condemn a few who are morally corrupt and who use human rights for political and financial gain,” he added. “To those who did not support us, we will continue to prove ourselves.” The Philippines previously served on the council from 2007 to 2009, and from 2012 to 2014. The country’s campaign to remain on the international body was fiercely opposed by rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York. It noted that Mr. Duterte had virtually given the police the all-clear to shoot and kill those suspected of drug dealing since becoming president two years ago. Ahead of the General Assembly vote, Mr. Duterte admitted for the first time that his “only sin is the extrajudicial killings.” The Philippine National Police recently said in its updated data on the drug war that an estimated 4,500 drug addicts and dealers have been killed. But Human Rights Watch, as well as other rights groups, say that as many as 12,000 suspects have been killed, including those slain by vigilantes who leave signs on their victims warning others not to follow in their wake. Mr. Cayetano accused critics of mounting “sustained and well-funded efforts” to block the Philippines’ bid. “The numbers speak volumes of the confidence of the international community on the human rights record of the Duterte administration and its vision of keeping each and every Filipino safe and secure,” he said, accusing critics of “weaponizing” human rights for their own agenda. “Our successful bid to keep our seat in the council is proof that many in the international community remain convinced the Philippines respects and protects human rights and have seen through the efforts of some to politicize and weaponize the issue,” he said. Jacqueline Ann de Guia, a lawyer and spokeswoman for the Philippines’ independent Commission on Human Rights, said that earning a seat on the council put pressure on Manila to prove its critics wrong. “The Philippines’ credibility to be part of this body rests on its ability to effect actions that will concretely address these allegations, in line with its mandate to promote, protect and fulfill and the human rights of all, and not just a select few,” Ms. de Guia said. She noted that the number of extrajudicial killings linked to the government’s drug war continued to grow. “Elevating states with records of gross human rights violations and abuses is a tremendous setback, Amnesty International USA’s advocacy director, Daniel Balson, said in reaction to the vote on Friday, according to The Associated Press. “It puts them on the world stage, and moreover, it empowers them to fundamentally undermine notions of human rights that are accepted internationally.” And Nikki Haley, the departing United States ambassador to the United Nations, said that the “lack of standards continues to undermine the organization and demonstrates again why the United States was right to withdraw” from the body in June, according to The A.P. Carlos Conde, a Philippine researcher for Human Rights Watch, said on Saturday that the country’s re-election to the rights commission was a “setback for accountability.” “That makes it unconscionable, a move that will only enable the Duterte government to continue the abuses related to the drug war,” Mr. Conde said. Apart from the Philippines, the other countries elected on Friday were Argentina, Austria, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Czech Republic, Denmark, Eritrea, Fiji, India, Italy, Somalia, Togo and Uruguay.",The New York Times
2018,Photo of a Starving Girl in Yemen Prompts Facebook to Remove Posts of Article,"For a few hours after The New York Times published an article about conflict and hunger in Yemen, Facebook temporarily removed posts from readers who had tried to share the report on the social platform. At issue was a photograph of a starving child. The article included several images of emaciated children. Some were crying. Some were listless. One, a 7-year-old girl named Amal, was shown gazing to the side, with flesh so paper-thin that her collarbone and rib cage were plainly visible. Tens of thousands of readers shared the article on Facebook, but some got a message notifying them that the post was not in line with Facebook’s community standards. Facebook had addressed the issue by Friday night. “As our community standards explain, we don’t allow nude images of children on Facebook, but we know this is an important image of global significance,” a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “We’re restoring the posts we removed on this basis.” The article highlighted the suffering of Yemeni civilians amid a devastating war pitting Houthi rebels and their allies against a Saudi-led coalition whose campaign of airstrikes, which are aided by American-supplied bombs and intelligence, have killed thousands of civilians. Economic warfare has worsened the despair for many Yemeni families, and the country is at risk of a catastrophic famine. The conflict began more than three years ago, and it received more attention when the killing of a Saudi dissident, Jamal Khashoggi, led to outrage and turned a spotlight on Saudi actions in the region. In another article on Friday, New York Times editors explained why they decided to publish the photos of the starving children. “They are brutal,” it said. “But they are also brutally honest. They reveal the horror that is Yemen today. You may choose not to look at them. But we thought you should be the ones to decide.” When Jarjieh Fang, a graduate student in Washington, saw the article about Yemen around noon on Friday, he found the photographs shocking. “I thought it would be something worth sharing, to sort of jolt people to start paying attention to what’s going on in Yemen,” he said. He posted a link to the article on his Facebook page, and couple hours later, he got a notification. His post had been taken down, and there was a message from Facebook. “On Facebook, we don’t allow offers of sexual services, solicitation of sexual material, threats or depictions of sexual violence, threats to share intimate images or any sexual content involving minors,” it said. Dozens of people complained about similar issues on social media or in emails to the journalists who originally reported the story. But it is unclear how many people were affected. Tens of thousands of people shared the story on Facebook, and many posts — including the one on The New York Times’ own Facebook page — were not taken down. The experience left Mr. Fang confused about Facebook’s policies. “I was disappointed when it was taken down so quickly, and that something so important was being scrubbed from people’s News Feeds,” he said. Facebook uses a combination of algorithms, employees and flags from users to screen for content that may need to be removed. The company did not have information about the number of people whose posts were removed on Friday. “We’re glad to hear that Facebook has reversed itself on this issue,” said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The New York Times. “It’s incredibly disappointing to think that this story would be blocked in violation of their community guidelines. The job of journalists is to bear witness and give voice to those who otherwise would not be heard. “This story is a stunning example of exactly that kind of work, from some of the very few journalists who are on the ground detailing the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Denying any readers access to the story is wrong.” Facebook’s temporary removal of the posts on Friday recalled a similar episode in 2016, when the social media company temporarily took down a post featuring a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph from the Vietnam War. It shows a 9-year-old girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, fleeing napalm bombs in 1972. And in 2015, Facebook had to revise its community standards after photos of women breast-feeding were removed from its pages.",The New York Times
2018,"Phylis Bamberger, Who Challenged Brutality at Attica, Dies at 79","Phylis Skloot Bamberger, a lawyer who successfully sued to protect inmates from what a federal judge described as “barbarous abuse” by guards in the wake of the 1971 Attica prison uprising, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 79. The cause was complications of Lewy body dementia, her son Richard said. Ms. Bamberger, who later became a judge herself, and William E. Hellerstein, both of the Legal Aid Society, were the lead lawyers representing the inmates. The prisoners were appealing lower court decisions denying an injunction against the ongoing “physical abuse, torture, beatings and other forms of brutality” that they said they had endured at Attica, about 37 miles east of Buffalo. The prison riot left 10 correction officers and civilian employees and 33 inmates dead after exasperated officials ordered the State Police to end the siege. The police stormed the prison on Sept. 13, 1971, in what one prosecutor later branded a “turkey shoot.” On Dec. 1, 1971, acting on Ms. Bamberger and Mr. Hellerstein’s lawsuit, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the District Court to prevent guards, State Police and correctional personnel from inflicting any further cruelty on the inmates, as had been committed for at least several days, the judges said. The ruling, by Judge Walter R. Mansfield, with the concurrence of Judges J. Edward Lumbard and James L. Oakes, said that the actions of those authorities had gone “wholly beyond any force needed to maintain order” and that they had “far exceeded what our society will tolerate on the part of officers of the law in custody of defenseless prisoners.” Judge Mansfield said that Ms. Bamberger and other Legal Aid Society lawyers had presented sufficient evidence that the inmates’ constitutional rights had been violated by an “orgy of brutality.” That included beating of inmates who were confined to stretchers, burning of some with matches and forcing others to “run naked through gauntlets of guards armed with clubs.” Heather Ann Thompson, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy” (2016), praised Ms. Bamberger in an email on Wednesday, citing her “tireless advocacy and her insistence that the legal and human rights of prisoners must be taken as seriously as those of people on the outside.” Dr. Thompson added: “Back in 1971, when the men in New York’s dreaded Attica Correctional Facility stood together to call attention to the terrible conditions they faced, Phylis Bamberger not only paid attention, but she spent her life thereafter working to make sure that all of New York’s prisoners would have meaningful access to the courts.” Phylis Skloot was born on May 2, 1939, in Brooklyn to George Skloot, who worked in a poultry market, and Martha (Wechselblatt) Skloot, who was employment director for the J. W. Mays Department Store. Phylis grew up in the Crown Heights and Flatbush neighborhoods. She graduated from Midwood High School and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1960 from Brooklyn College, where she majored in political science, and a law degree from New York University School of Law. She joined the Legal Aid Society in 1963; by the time she left, in 1972, she was managing appeals in the Second Circuit, covering districts in New York, Connecticut and Vermont. From 1972 to 1988, Ms. Bamberger oversaw the Federal Defender Services Appeals Unit for the Second Circuit in New York as attorney in charge; in that post she was among the first women to head a federal defender office in the country. She served as a State Supreme Court justice in the Bronx from 1988 to 2005. Among her cases, Judge Bamberger was scheduled to preside over the first-degree murder trial of Angel Diaz, who was accused of killing Police Officer Kevin Gillespie during a robbery spree with two other defendants in 1996. But Mr. Diaz hanged himself in jail before he could be tried. The case had received wide publicity when Gov. George E. Pataki removed the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, from the case because of his refusal to pursue the death penalty, which had just been reinstated. (Mr. Diaz’s accomplices were convicted of other charges and sentenced to long prison terms.) After Ms. Bamberger left the bench, she taught and wrote about wrongful convictions and other criminal justice issues. She is survived by her husband, Michael Bamberger, a First Amendment lawyer; their sons, Richard, a former communications director for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and Kenneth, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley; eight grandchildren; and two brothers, Edward and Robert Skloot.",The New York Times
2018,"Phyllis Kind, Art Dealer Who Took In Outsiders, Dies at 85","Phyllis Kind, a combative, visionary art dealer whose championing of a group of young artists called the Chicago Imagists as well as major outsider artists helped expand the narrative of 20th-century art, died on Sept. 28 in San Francisco. She was 85. The cause was respiratory failure, her family said. Her last gallery, in New York, closed in 2009. Fierce, intelligent and loquacious, Ms. Kind would just as soon argue with you as look at you. She had namesake galleries in both Chicago and New York during the 1980s and ’90s, a period when the neatly defined mainstream, dominated by Pop Art and abstraction, was becoming much broader and less orderly. And she did her bit to shake things up. As the first American dealer to show outsider art alongside that of contemporary artists, Ms. Kind was in many ways as important as Leo Castelli, the dean of New York dealers, who introduced the work of Jasper Johns and at one point represented nearly every Pop and Minimalist artist of note. “Phyllis was a pioneer,” said Elsa Longhauser, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. “She was bold, outrageous and incredibly generous with her knowledge and contacts. She really introduced the art world to a whole new field.” Ms. Kind, a former schoolteacher who enjoyed art, entered the art world in Chicago in 1967, when, at the suggestion of her husband, who was teaching art history, she opened a gallery, calling it Pro Grafica Arte. She planned to sell mostly master prints, one of his areas of expertise. But she also started to follow Chicago’s contemporary art scene, which was in creative ferment. Young artists — first known collectively as the Hairy Who, and later as the larger group the Chicago Imagists — were emerging, especially in galvanizing shows at the Hyde Park Art Center. Among them were Jim Nutt, Gladys Nilsson, Roger Brown, Christina Ramberg and Karl Wirsum. Ms. Kind was drawn to their sexually confrontational, mongrel figuration, which absorbed aspects of illustration, the comics and Surrealism. In a sense, these artists were outsider Pop artists; not surprisingly, they were deeply attracted to the work of the real outsiders then beginning to surface. One of the first was the great Joseph Yoakum (1890-1972), who was discovered making his fantastical landscapes on Chicago’s South Side in 1967. Ms. Kind gave the Imagists their first solo shows, starting with Mr. Nutt and Ms. Nilsson in 1970 and Mr. Brown in 1971. In 1972, the year the term “outsider art” was coined, she mounted her first group show of this material, “The Artless Artist: Contemporary ‘Naïve’ Works.” Anyone paying attention was stunned by her shows. They were the first devoted to major, previously unknown outsiders, most notably the Mexican artist Martín Ramírez (1895-1963), whose work Mr. Nutt uncovered in 1970 while teaching in Northern California, and Henry Darger (1892-1973), a hospital custodian whose panoramic battle scenes and epic writings were discovered after his death in the single room he rented from the Chicago photographer Nathan Lerner. Ms. Kind also introduced Americans to prominent European outsiders, including Adolf Wölfli (1864-1930), Augustine Lesage (1876-1954) and Carlo Zinelli (1916-74). She was excited by what she called “the art of necessity.” “I look for a strong, original vocabulary of form,” she said, “and for evidence that the artists are making art not because they might want to but instead because they have to.” Phyllis Barbara Cobin was born on April 1, 1933, in the Bronx, the only child of Harold and Dorothy (Weintraub) Cobin. Her father was a dentist, and her mother worked in his office. Phyllis attended the Bronx High School of Science and studied chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. There she met Joshua Kind, an art history major. They married in 1956 and moved to New York City, where Phyllis taught elementary school while Joshua pursued a doctorate in Renaissance art at Columbia University. The couple moved to Chicago in 1959, when Mr. Kind took a teaching position at Northwestern University in nearby Evanston, Ill. He taught at the University of Chicago starting in 1962. They enjoyed buying underpriced prints at auction, and Joshua Kind offered to help Ms. Kind start a gallery in master prints and drawings. Her initial reaction, as she recalled, was characteristically sharp: “Why would I want to run a store?” But she conceded that she was bored and followed his suggestion. The couple divorced in the 1970s. Ms. Kind is survived by their four children, Jonathan, Gabriel, Deborah and Rachel Kind; seven grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and three stepbrothers, William, Thomas and Mark Cobin. Ms. Kind’s success in Chicago led her to open a gallery in New York in 1975 on the second floor of a building on Spring Street in SoHo. She found artists whose figuration had the originality that she sought and over the years represented many of them, including Alison Saar, Robert Colescott, William N. Copley, Gillian Jagger and Mark Greenwold. One of her first New York shows was the 1979 solo debut of Mr. Greenwold, an obsessive miniaturist of family life and strife. After much discussion, he convinced Ms. Kind to let him show just one small painting, “Sewing Room (for Barbara),” on which he had labored for three years. Depicting the artist and his wife involved in an unusually violent domestic altercation, the work caused a stir. The critic Lucy R. Lippard wrote a letter to Ms. Kind saying that the dealer should be ashamed of showing such work. But in a recent email, Mr. Greenwold wrote, “Phyllis, no shrinking violet, didn’t blink — she never blinked.” In 1983, Ms. Kind moved her New York gallery to more generous ground-floor quarters in SoHo on Greene Street, where it thrived as an important resource for anyone interested in American and European outsiders. Under Ms. Kind’s tutelage, or that of her trusted gallery director, Ron Jagger, many curators, critics, artists and collectors indeed became interested. Visits to her gallery could turn into seminar-like discussions, either in the gallery’s main space or downstairs, where the works of outsider artists were usually on view, ready to stimulate conversation.",The New York Times
2018,Piano Stars Gather for a Legend’s 90th,"The virtuoso Gary Graffman, the teacher of Yuja Wang and Lang Lang, celebrated his birthday with musical royalty (and a grand-piano “Happy Birthday to You”). It was his 90th birthday party on Sunday evening, and the pianist Gary Graffman was holding court. Lang Lang, a former student and current superstar, bounded into Mr. Graffman’s apartment across from Carnegie Hall with a present. “No, don’t get up,” Mr. Lang protested as Mr. Graffman rose. “I want to show you that I can get up!” Mr. Graffman said with a laugh, putting down his mango-flavored vodka. A few minutes later, the pianist Leon Fleisher arrived. “Somebody older than I am!” Mr. Graffman exclaimed, greeting Mr. Fleisher, his senior by a few months. Many decades ago, the two were in the same generation of musicians, a group once jocularly called OYAPs: Outstanding Young American Pianists. When they sat down to catch up on a sofa in the living room, Emanuel Ax — yet another piano star — couldn’t resist snapping a photo. It was one of those only-in-New-York nights, gathering enough musicians to headline several galas in celebration of a beloved figure in the classical music world. To get a sense of what all the fuss was about, here is a look back at highlights of Mr. Graffman’s storied career. It was a huge break for an unknown teenager: playing Rachmaninoff’s Second Piano Concerto with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Eugene Ormandy. Mr. Graffman landed the gig by winning a competition — and later lamented his youthful ignorance of rehearsal etiquette. “I thought that if I heard something not quite to my liking, I could just stop playing and say, ‘A little faster, please, Mr. Ormandy,’” he recalled in his 1981 memoir, “I Really Should Be Practicing.” Such irreverence, he learned, was “the equivalent of farting in a cathedral.” Mr. Graffman studied with some of the great pianists of the 20th century: At 7, he became a pupil of Isabelle Vengerova at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and was later taught by Rudolf Serkin at the Marlboro Music Festival, then by Vladimir Horowitz in informal sessions that began after 8 p.m. and could last until 2 a.m. The two piano masters took very different approaches. Serkin would often describe piano pieces in terms of other instruments: “In Marlboro the talk was mainly about a left-hand passage representing, say, a cello rather than a bassoon,” Mr. Graffman later wrote, “while a certain right-hand melody might bring to mind the quality of a viola.” “But Horowitz,” he wrote, “was more concerned with trying to make the piano sound like a human voice, and continually analyzed how a great singer would phrase a certain passage.” His career exploded in the 1950s. Mr. Graffman started playing roughly 100 concerts a year, and pulled off the rare feat of recording with each of what were then known as the “Big Five” orchestras — those of Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia. But he soon made even bigger news by not playing. Mr. Graffman pulled out of a concert he was contracted to play in 1964 in Jackson, Miss., after members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee wrote to tell him that the hall was segregated and that two black students had been arrested after trying to attend an earlier performance there by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of London. “This is the first time that a distinguished concert artist has joined other entertainment personalities in boycotting Mississippi’s capital since last year’s racial demonstrations,” an article in The New York Times said. His move dismayed his managers — who tried to talk him out of it, and struggled to find a replacement — but the boycott was soon taken up by other classical musicians. The great Swedish dramatic soprano Birgit Nilsson later canceled her appearance in Jackson. It was a pianist’s worst nightmare: By 1979, the ring and little fingers of Mr. Graffman’s right hand had grown so weak that he could no longer play as he used to. His career, as he had known it, was over. He had just made his last recording with two hands, and it was a hit: He played the “Rhapsody in Blue” solo on the soundtrack album for Woody Allen’s “Manhattan” (although, as he admitted decades later, he is not heard in the actual film because a snowstorm kept him from the original recording session.) After consulting many doctors, and helping spur new interest in music medicine, Mr. Graffman started a remarkable second act. He began performing repertoire for the left hand only — playing many pieces written for Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in World War I — and returned to Curtis, now as a teacher. Things came full circle in 1986, when, 50 years after he had first arrived as a 7-year-old, Mr. Graffman took over Curtis, first as artistic director and then as president. He led the school for two decades. His students there included two of the biggest piano stars of the 21st century: Mr. Lang and Yuja Wang. At the party, Mr. Lang recalled how Mr. Graffman had put him at ease when he first went to Curtis, at the age of 14, for his audition: by speaking to him in Mandarin. “Gary is one of — not one of, he is the most generous person, most generous mentor that I ever had,” Mr. Lang said. “He really shared endless love to me, and to all his students.” Ms. Wang was on tour in South America, but sent birthday wishes on WeChat, the Chinese messaging app, and a photo of herself by an ornate silvery carriage. Mr. Graffman wrote back: “If you’re coming here in that carriage, I’m afraid you will be a little late.” After dinner, the room hushed, and suddenly there was an explosion of sound from one of the two grand pianos in the living room: Mr. Lang was playing “Happy Birthday to You” as only a star pianist can, with Romantic bombast and a dizzying cadenza.",The New York Times

2018,"Pierre Huyghe Reads Our Minds, and Discovers a New Art Form","Critic’s Pick In a commanding new exhibition at London’s Serpentine Galleries, the French artist makes images directly from brain activity — and adds 10,000 flies for good measure. LONDON — You wake up from a vivid dream, but find it’s gone by daylight; you see something beautiful or surprising in the morning, but can’t describe it fully by afternoon. What if you could just download your thoughts into images, without the intercession of memory or language? The French artist Pierre Huyghe wondered too, and his new exhibition here, made with the help of some ambitious neuroscientists and some nifty technology, suggests what the images in our heads might look like. Mr. Huyghe has always been a cerebral artist, but his new show here is cerebral in a literal way — generated from consciousness itself. Mr. Huyghe’s exhibition “Uumwelt,” which opened last week at the Serpentine Galleries in London’s stately Kensington Gardens, offers something uncommon in an art setting: a wholly new kind of imagery. The artist collaborated with Japanese scientists who can translate M.R.I. scans into pictures, and the resultant, restless impressions of brain activity mutate and pullulate from frame to frame. The screens here have their own kind of life, and as you spend longer in the Serpentine’s dimmed galleries the very boundaries between images and humans (and other living creatures) start to dissolve. Anyone who cares about the future of either art or neuroscience should see this commanding show, which, like all the best science fictions, offers equal amounts of hope and fright. It represents a return to the controlled spaces of museums after some of Mr. Huyghe’s acclaimed recent environmental projects, like his transformation of an abandoned German skating rink into a posthuman ecosystem at last year’s Münster Sculpture Project, though this new show, too, is a living garden in its own way. At the Serpentine, Mr. Huyghe — it’s pronounced WEEG, one syllable, silent H — has shaded the skylights, busted up some walls, and installed five free-standing LED screens on which images flicker past, dozens of times per second. The images are fuzzy and jerky, often in a Gustonish palette of pinks and reds and grays, and for fleeting milliseconds they seem to depict objects or animals against a plain white background. But they never stay put for long. The images spawn bulbous deformations, then transform again. (A soft, clicking ambient score provides a beat, and links the work to Mr. Huyghe’s early videos backed by musique concrète; the walls have been sanded down to reveal earlier paint jobs, and sawdust scents the rooms.) These images were not made with a camera; what we are looking at are endless frantic attempts to render human thoughts into visual form. Mr. Huyghe collaborated with the neuroscientist Yukiyasu Kamitani, whose lab at Kyoto University has developed artificial intelligence software that decodes human brain activity and renders it as images. In Kyoto Mr. Huyghe had participants enter an M.R.I. scanner and look at pictures or think about ideas; then he used Mr. Kamitani’s software to represent the neural activity. The artist has retouched these products of consciousness only slightly; the images I have seen from Mr. Kamitani’s lab appear nearly identical to stills of Mr. Huyghe’s videos. They are perplexing to watch, but engrossing. On the first screen I thought I saw a chick or a frog taking shape, though the creature would palpitate into an egg, a lumpen lime or a blastula of germinating cells. The screen in the Serpentine’s western gallery appeared to depict a nude of unknown gender; I thought I saw a bra at several points before it blistered for milliseconds at a time. The most abstract of the screens has the appearance of a blurred Gerhard Richter seascape at moments, while the most solidly representational of them oscillates between a Pomeranian puppy and that creepy kid’s toy known as Furby. The images are never complete, in a perpetual process of becoming — and that may be the most human, and disconcerting, thing about them. Many artists today are exploring artificial intelligence, but imagistic expressions of AI in the gallery have been largely trite, relying far too much on received appearances from the video game developers of Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Mr. Huyghe’s flickering screens, by anxious contrast, have the breath of life. What we are looking at is 100 dogs, 1,000 seascapes, formed pixel by pixel out of the human brain and an ever-growing database. Mr. Huyghe shot to prominence in the late 1990s, alongside his Parisian colleagues Philippe Parreno and Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, with a series of videos and performances that revealed the subtle workings of narrative and ideology in contemporary media. In works like “The Third Memory” (2000) and “Streamside Day Follies” (2003), the artist choreographed scenarios for performers or participants, who would then be free to behave as they wished within his scheme. He would carry through this half-defined, half-open technique in his later environments; now he devises complex collections of living and dead elements, which propagate and transform over time without the artist’s intervention. At the Münster skating rink, algae blossomed in standing pools, peacocks strutted about, and human cancer cells metastasized in an incubator. Ants and bees, an adorable dog and even a mysterious albino penguin have played a critical role in these installations, chosen because animals behave in ways the artist cannot control. Here at the Serpentine, Mr. Huyghe has unleashed some 10,000 flies into the galleries, seen resting on the screens or lying dead under your feet. The museum itself becomes a living, mutating ecosystem, and even the images on the screens are modified throughout the day, triggered by sensors that respond to temperature and humidity. Note the exhibition’s title, “Uumwelt”: the German word for “environment” rendered, like the neuroscientific images here, with a stutter. What makes the Serpentine show such a landmark is that it fuses the strains of Mr. Huyghe’s art — the earlier media strain and the later ecological strain — in a fashion that feels utterly contemporary. He has never given up on images during the environmental phase of his career; his lugubrious “Untitled (Human Mask),” completed in 2014, was a relatively straightforward narrative film that tracked a monkey in post-tsunami Fukushima. Yet here at the Serpentine, images themselves have a biological character that makes them more than mere representations of ecological change. The pictures are themselves “alive,” biotic, reacting to stimuli and growing in sophistication, and the show thus comprises a grand assemblage of real and artificial intelligences: the Japanese participants and the lab’s software, the flies’ little brains and our big ones. You begin to understand, as Mr. Huyghe’s brain scans wash over you, how images are part of the environment and climate is a kind of culture. Critics aren’t supposed to have favorite artists. We’re supposed to look without favor, to come to passionate conclusions through dispassionate observation. But I can’t deny that Mr. Huyghe, for two decades now, has been the artist I trust most to forge a new art out of our present media chaos and ecological degradation. (I do think he took a wrong turn around 2010 with “The Host and the Cloud,” his overwrought 3-hour film with rutting Parisiennes and the Trix bunny, and the boulders and trilobites he placed on the roof of the Met in 2015 were an underwhelming cop-out.) I have checked my gut a lot this week as I’ve contemplated these freakish moving images, asking myself where the border lies between science and art and whether I cut him too much slack. And what I come back with, still, is that “Uumwelt” is a breakthrough of immense importance, because it both charts a path forward for artists and universalizes the act of artistic creation. Early on in “The Lives of the Artists,” the foundational text of Renaissance art history, Giorgio Vasari explains that a great artist does not accurately reproduce the world, but draws forth images da se, “from himself,” in an act of skilled imagination. What Mr. Huyghe has proved — confoundingly, thrillingly — is that artistic creation could be a general tendency, not even limited to our own species, if we provided everyone the right tools. Those flies buzzing about, whose compound eyes can see Mr. Huyghe’s flickering screens four times more clearly than we can, could have their own museum exhibition soon.",The New York Times
2018,"Pik Botha, South Africa’s Last Apartheid Foreign Minister, Dies at 86","Pik Botha, South Africa’s longtime foreign minister, whose defense of apartheid was tempered by flashes of recognition of the system’s injustice, and who went on to serve in Nelson Mandela’s unity government, died on Friday at his home on the outskirts of Pretoria. He was 86. His death was confirmed by his son Piet. Mr. Botha was a busy figure on the world diplomatic scene as foreign minister from the late 1970s through the ’80s, a time of deepening unrest in South Africa, when the government crackdown on protests to white rule was growing increasingly violent. It was also a time of rising international pressure against the racist regime. Mr. Botha fought the imposition of Western sanctions on his country. A bluff, plain-spoken man popular with the white electorate and a jocular off-the-record drinking companion of journalists, Mr. Botha at times showed a moderate streak rarely found among his hard-line party fellows. In 1970, during his first address to Parliament as a member, he urged the government to subscribe to the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, a move that had been strongly resisted. In 1974, while serving as South Africa’s ambassador to the United Nations, he stated that discrimination on the basis of skin color — the foundation of apartheid rule — was indefensible. And in 1986, with the end of apartheid approaching, he said at a press briefing, “It would possibly become unavoidable that in the future you might have a black president of this country,” as long as minority rights were guaranteed. The president of South Africa, P. W. Botha (no relation), forced him to retract the statement. Pik Botha served as foreign minister from 1977 until democratic elections in 1994 ended apartheid. He joined the Mandela-led coalition government — comprising the African National Congress, which had waged the fight against white-minority rule, and the formerly ruling National Party — as minister of minerals and energy. But he left two years later, when his party pulled out, and retired from politics. Mr. Botha was “one of the few” from his party “who recognized at an early stage that apartheid was a wrong and crime against humanity,” the A.N.C. said in a statement after his death. President Cyril Ramaphosa, himself a prominent anti-apartheid leader, said Mr. Botha “would be remembered for his support for South Africa’s transition to democracy and for his service in the first democratic administration,” according to a statement from his office. Mr. Botha declared his support for the African National Congress in 2000. “Afrikaners, whites should support the A.N.C.,” he said in interviews. “We cannot just continue with blacks voting A.N.C. and whites voting for the opposition. I want to break with the racist attitudes of the past.” Some news reports said he had actually joined the A.N.C., but he denied this years later. Roelof Frederik Botha was born on April 27, 1932, in Rustenburg, about 80 miles west of Pretoria. His father, also named Roelof Frederik, was a schoolteacher; his mother, Maria Elizabeth (Dreyer) Botha, was a homemaker. Mr. Botha was educated in Potchefstroom, to the south and closer to Johannesburg, and received a law degree from the University of Pretoria. His nickname, Pik, is short for pikkewyn, Afrikaans for penguin. He acquired it later on, some thought, because of his resemblance to that bird when he wore a suit. Mr. Botha joined the foreign service and served in Sweden and West Germany. In 1963 he helped defend South Africa in a case brought by Liberia and Ethiopia against it in the International Court of Justice at The Hague, challenging its administration of South West Africa, which later became Namibia. The case was dismissed. In 1975 he was appointed ambassador to the United States while also serving as permanent representative to the United Nations. As foreign minister, Mr. Botha was involved in the talks that led to Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, and talks that preceded Namibia’s independence a decade later. He negotiated a delicate peace accord between South Africa and Mozambique in 1984. Mr. Botha also helped broker an agreement that brought an end to a Cold War proxy struggle in Angola, which included South African forces on one side and Cuban troops on the other. In addition to his son Piet, Mr. Botha’s survivors include his wife, Ina; another son, Roelof; two daughters, Anna Hertzog and Lien Botha; and a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His first wife, Helena Bosman, died in 1996. Toward the end of his life, Mr. Botha paid tribute to Nelson Mandela and the goal of racial coexistence. “From our point of view, he led an organization which we regarded as a terrorist organization, and they saw themselves as freedom fighters,” he said in an interview with the BBC in 2013, the year Mr. Mandela died. “Of course, all of that had to change. It is not always that simple and easy to change, you know, mental attitudes, mind-sets, but eventually it did change.” Speaking of Mr. Mandela, he said, “I so often experience his capacity to forgive, and then his will to improve the country, its systems, the poor black people, uplift them but without damaging the economy.” He added, “Black and white in this country need each other to succeed.” An earlier version of this obituary misspelled Mr. Botha’s middle name. His full name was Roelof Frederik Botha, not Frederick.",The New York Times
2018,Pilot Killed Off Long Island Owned 2 Other Planes That Crashed,"The pilot of a small plane who was killed when the aircraft crashed off Long Island on Saturday had also owned two other planes involved in crashes in recent years, one of them fatal, according to government records and accident reports. The body of the pilot, Munidat “Raj” Persaud, was identified on Sunday by the New York State Police. Later Sunday, the Coast Guard recovered the bodies of two other people who were on board when the plane went down in the Atlantic Ocean near the village of Quogue. The two passengers on the aircraft, a twin-engine Piper PA-34 flying from Connecticut to Charleston, S.C., were not immediately identified. Part of the wreckage was found on Saturday, and the fuselage was located Sunday afternoon. A Coast Guard spokesman, Petty Officer Steve Strohmaier, said efforts were being made to bring it to the surface. The Federal Aviation Administration’s online database lists Mr. Persaud as the owner of the plane. The State Police confirmed that Mr. Persaud, who lived in Westbury, Conn., and operated a flight school there, owned the aircraft. His ex-wife, Shakuntala Persaud, said that Mr. Persaud, a 47-year-old father of two, opened a flight school in 2004 called Oxford Flight Training after working as a mechanic for a succession of major airlines. Last year he opened a second flight school in Danbury, Conn. “He likes to be in the air. It’s the only place he feels free, that’s his passion. It’s his identity,” Ms. Persaud said Sunday at her home in Connecticut. “He’s a good person.” Mr. Persaud was listed by the F.A.A. as the owner of at least 12 other aircraft, including the two others involved in crashes. In one, also a Piper twin-engine airplane, crashed into a mountain in Vermont in May, according to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot, who was the only person on board, was killed. The pilot was a friend of Mr. Persaud’s. “He cried, and he’s not going to cry in front of no one,” Ms. Persaud said. “That was his friend, one he trusted very well.” The N.T.S.B. report said the pilot had been advised to postpone his flight from Burlington, Vt., to the Waterbury-Oxford Airport in Connecticut because of weather. The report did not indicate that there were any mechanical problems with the aircraft. In the other accident, in 2016, a student pilot flying alone was seriously injured when he missed the runway while attempting to land a Cessna at an airport in Pittsfield, Mass. A safety board report attributed the accident to pilot error. Officials said that the plane piloted by Mr. Persaud on Saturday left the Waterbury-Oxford Airport and made a short flight to Danbury, Conn. It then took off from there and was headed to the Charleston Executive Airport. Witnesses saw the plane go down around 11 a.m. on Saturday. Peter Sartorius, the mayor of Quogue, said people at the Surf Club of Quogue called 911. “There were a lot of responders there, including a lot of boats and some aircraft,” Mr. Sartorius said. Mr. Persaud’s body was recovered just after noon in a debris field. Ms. Persaud, referring to the earlier crashes, said her ex-husband understood that flying came with serious risks. “He knew it could have been him,” she said. “He just didn’t know when.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a 2016 crash of a plane owned by Munidat Persaud resulted in a fatality. The pilot was seriously injured, but did not die.",The New York Times
2018,"Pipe Bomb Arrest, Yemen, Midterms: Your Friday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A man was arrested and charged in a weeklong pipe bomb campaign targeting critics of President Trump. Federal authorities identified the suspect as Cesar Sayoc Jr., a 56-year-old Florida man who is an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump. Records show that he has a long criminal history and ties to New York. Here’s what we know about him. Above, an F.B.I. agent examining a van in Plantation, Fla. His arrest came even as four more bombs were found around the country, including ones addressed to Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California. “These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,” President Trump said, hours after the arrest. Here’s what the targeted individuals previously said about President Trump, and what he has said about them. None of the devices has detonated, and no one has been harmed. _____ 2. “We are being crushed.” Millions of civilians in Yemen have been pushed to the brink of starvation by a devastating war led by Saudi Arabia. The problem isn’t a food shortage — it’s deliberate economic warfare by the Saudis, driving people deeper into poverty and risking a catastrophic famine. A doctor in a health clinic overwhelmed by refugees pointed out one drowsy 7-year-old girl with stick-like arms. “Look,” she said. “No meat. Only bones.” The unsettling photographs with this article, of emaciated children, are difficult to look at. Here’s why The Times decided to publish them. Above, a boy in Sana, Yemen. Separately, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey pressed Saudi Arabia to reveal who gave the orders to kill Jamal Khashoggi and demanded that its leaders explain what happened to the dissident journalist’s body. _____ 3. President Trump may announce a broad crackdown on the southern border next week, administration officials said, making a play to energize his anti-immigrant base before the midterm elections. Mr. Trump is considering using executive actions to block entry to Central American migrants and asylum-seekers. Deploying hundreds of Army troops and cutting economic aid to Central American countries are also being discussed. Above, migrants boarded a truck in southern Mexico. It’s not clear that the plan to block asylum-seekers would be legal under U.S. or international law, and it could take a long time to put in place. But in considering the strategy, Mr. Trump seemed to be betting that the political impact would be more immediate. _____ 4. Stacey Abrams has spent a lifetime opening doors. Now she’s pushing on her biggest one yet. She’s the Democratic candidate for governor in the reliably Republican state of Georgia. And if she wins in November, she will become the first black woman elected governor of any state, ever. Above, she campaigned in Valdosta, Ga. Her personal history and her rise from poverty to power have lent her campaign sizzle. Now the polls show Ms. Abrams and her Republican opponent, Secretary of State Brian Kemp, in a very tight race. Also check out The Tip Sheet, our daily analysis of the midterms. Today we cover Republicans spending more than they would like to defend seats that were once reliably red. _____ 5. The U.S. economy grew 3.5 percent at an annualized rate in the three months ending in September, the Commerce Department reported. The growth was powered by a 4 percent increase in consumer spending. Above, checking out in Concord, N.C. The rate was ahead of expectations, in part because of businesses building up inventory, which added more than two percentage points to overall growth. The numbers in this latest report appear strong, but analysts said the underlying picture was more mixed. Business spending barely increased, after surging in the first quarter. And stocks resumed their slide today, with the S. & P. 500-stock index briefly falling into a correction — meaning the benchmark stock index was 10 percent off its most recent peak — before recovering some of those losses. _____ 6. Screen panic is gripping Silicon Valley. The tech elite are increasingly sure that screen time is bad for kids. So they’re asking their nannies to keep phones, tablets, computers and TVs off and hidden. Some even make sitters sign no-phone contracts. “Almost every parent I work for is very strong about the child not having any technical experience at all,” one nanny said. Why? The people who are closest to a thing are often the most wary of it. At the same time, worries about a new digital divide are rising: In this one, public schools are embracing screens as teaching tools — while the rich are banning them from classes altogether. _____ 7. Voters in Washington State will decide this Election Day whether to charge companies and utilities for their carbon emissions. It would be the first state to do so. The proposed fees would be expected to raise $2.3 billion in the first five years. The initiative would fight climate change directly and, its proponents hope, move the state toward being a green energy hub. But opponents fear rural areas would see little financial benefit, while the companies that pay the fees would pass the costs along to residents. Above, a power plant near Centralia, Wash. A previous carbon-pricing effort failed in Washington in 2016. One difference this time around is the messaging: The initiative technically calls for a fee, not a tax — a distinction that might be more palatable to voters. _____ 8. It was a vegetable garden, and a chance for redemption. After three years in prison, Marc Peeples, who is black, returned to his Detroit neighborhood to plant seeds that could help feed neighbors and teach children about farming. But before long, three women who lived nearby began reporting him to the police, their accusations growing increasingly serious. They were white. Eventually, Mr. Peeples, above, was arrested and went to trial. It was another example, his lawyer said, of white people calling the police on a black person for everyday activities. A judge has dismissed the case. _____ 9. The World Series picks up again at 8:09 p.m. Eastern when the Red Sox face the Dodgers in Los Angeles in Game 3. Boston is ahead in the series, two games to none. Keep an eye on the infield for baseball’s latest dance, the defensive shift. Our journalists can lead you through the steps. _____ 10. Finally, this is your periodic reminder that it’s not all bad news out there. A quick-thinking woman saved her husband’s life days before their son was born. A blind climber who conquered Mount Everest is teaching outdoor skills to others with physical challenges. And a scientific study hinted that deep whiffs of lavender might be as effective as a Valium in reducing stress and anxiety. This is the Week in Good News. Have a tranquil weekend.

2018,Pipe Bombs Investigation Turns Toward Florida as More Trump Critics Are Targeted,"[Latest: two more devices were intercepted, one addressed to Senator Cory Booker and the other to James R. Clapper Jr., the former senior intelligence official.] Federal authorities investigating a spate of pipe bombs sent this week to several prominent critics of President Trump have turned their attention to southern Florida, believing that a number of the devices were mailed from there, two people briefed on the matter said Thursday. The focus on Florida came as three more devices were found, the F.B.I. said. Two were addressed to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Delaware and a third to the actor Robert De Niro, who lives and works in Lower Manhattan. All 10 of the similar-looking packages discovered since Monday bore return addresses from Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida. And Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told Fox News on Thursday that some of the packages were sent from within the state. Information collected by the United States Postal Service focused attention on certain Florida postal centers, including one in Opa-locka that the Miami-Dade Police Department’s bomb squad and K-9 unit swept on Thursday as a “precautionary measure.” The continuing wave of bombs has prompted an intense nationwide investigation into whether Trump critics or others vilified by the right are being targeted. None of the devices have so far exploded on their own, and investigators have been trying to determine whether any were even capable of detonating. Striking a note of caution, the New York City police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said at a news conference that the packages contained “live devices” that should be “treated with the utmost seriousness.” At least 14 explosive packages have been discovered since Monday. Here are where they were found and who they were addressed to. Monday Wednesday Hillary Clinton John O. Brennan George Soros Barack Obama Maxine Waters Maxine Waters Eric H. Holder Jr. Thursday Friday Robert De Niro James R. Clapper Jr. Kamala Harris Tom Steyer Joseph R. Biden Jr. Cory Booker Monday Wednesday Hillary Clinton John O. Brennan Barack Obama Maxine Waters George Soros Maxine Waters Eric H. Holder Jr. Thursday Friday James R. Clapper Jr. Robert De Niro Joseph R. Biden Jr. Kamala Harris Tom Steyer Cory Booker Monday George Soros Wednesday Hillary Clinton Barack Obama Eric H. Holder Jr. Maxine Waters John O. Brennan Thursday Robert De Niro Joseph R. Biden Jr. Friday Cory Booker James R. Clapper Jr. Kamala Harris Tom Steyer A device intended for Mr. Holder was misaddressed and sent to Debbie Wasserman Schultz's office because her name was on the return address. Two packages each were addressed to Mr. Biden and Ms. Waters. | By Jugal K. Patel and Joe Ward “The devices should be considered dangerous,” Mr. O’Neill said. [What we know — and don’t know — about the bombs] A law enforcement official said the envelope and printed address labels on the packages sent to Mr. Biden and Mr. De Niro were similar to those sent to the CNN offices in New York and to former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others. An X-ray showed the package sent to Mr. De Niro contained a device that seemed to be a pipe bomb. Federal, state and local investigators in New York, Washington, Florida and Los Angeles have all joined forces in the rapidly widening case, which has sent a shock through the nation’s political and news media establishments. Though investigators initially believed that some of the packages were delivered by hand or courier, they have now concluded that all 10 were likely sent through the mail, a person briefed on the matter said. The Postal Service records images of mail that comes into its system. As part of the inquiry, officials have been searching those images in an effort to determine where the packages originated, as well as to identify and catch any other possible explosive devices. In addition to conducting a forensic examination of the packages and explosive devices, federal authorities were seeking to determine where the envelopes, mailing labels and bomb components were purchased. Several law-enforcement officials said that investigators would likely obtain data from cell towers in the areas where they believe the packages were mailed. The data from each area could then be cross-referenced to create lists of phone numbers — and, ultimately, phone users — who were in the areas around the times the packages were mailed, the officials said. The devices sent to Mr. Biden were intercepted at a United States Postal Service facility in Delaware, a law enforcement official said. Similar to one that had been sent to Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, the envelopes were misaddressed and were redirected to Ms. Wasserman Schultz’s return address. The package sent to Mr. De Niro had been sitting in a mailroom at his movie company, TriBeCa Productions, since at least Tuesday, according to a person briefed on the investigation. Security personnel at the company discovered it about 5 a.m. Thursday and called the New York Police Department, whose bomb squad responded, officials briefed on the matter said. Before dawn, a swarm of police vehicles and ambulances on standby choked the streets of the TriBeCa neighborhood. The police closed off several blocks around the building that houses the film company and Mr. De Niro’s restaurant, the TriBeCa Grill. The package was removed about 6:30 a.m. and taken to the Police Department’s range in the Bronx. It was later driven to the F.B.I. lab in Quantico, Va., along with the device found at CNN and those intercepted in Delaware. Mr. De Niro, like the other recipients of packages, has been a frequent critic of Mr. Trump. During the Tony Awards ceremony in June, he gave a speech in which he attacked the president with an obscenity, and a video of his comments was widely shared on social media. [Robert De Niro has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump] Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said on Thursday that an “eagle-eyed security employee” at TriBeCa Productions had noticed similarities between the package the company received and photos of envelopes that were discovered on Wednesday. “There is somebody, by definition, who is a serial bomber, yes, and a terrorist,” Mr. de Blasio said in an appearance on CNN, whose New York office also received an explosive device on Wednesday. In anticipation of additional packages being found on Thursday, the New York Police Department deployed additional officers outside news media companies and elected officials’ offices, Mr. de Blasio said. Tension continued to run high throughout the day. Just after 7:30 p.m., some people inside the Time Warner Center shops were asked to leave as the police investigated a pair of unattended packages. A law enforcement official said it appeared to be a “routine suspicious package” call unrelated to the pipe bombs. The building, which also houses CNN’s New York offices, was not evacuated. The first bomb was found on Monday at the home of George Soros, the billionaire advocate of liberal causes, in Westchester County, north of New York City. In recent days, some on the right have falsely speculated that he funded the caravan of migrants moving north from Honduras. On Wednesday, several new bombs were discovered, one after the other. First, there was word that the Secret Service had intercepted packages addressed to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama. Then a package addressed to John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, was found in the offices of CNN in Midtown Manhattan. By the end of the day one package was discovered addressed to Mr. Holder, who recently said of opponents on the right, “When they go low, we kick them.” Two other packages were sent to Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, who has repeatedly traded barbs with Mr. Trump. [For a country already on edge, the attempted attacks marked an unsettling turn ahead of the midterm election] All the packages were sent in manila envelopes lined with Bubble Wrap. Each was fixed with about a half dozen first-class postage stamps and had return addresses with the name, misspelled, of Ms. Wasserman Schultz, who was once chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. A white powder included in the package sent to CNN did not present a biological threat, the F.B.I. said on Thursday.",The New York Times
2018,"Pipe Bombs, Google, Megyn Kelly: Your Friday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: Federal authorities arrested a man in Florida this morning in connection with a series of explosive devices sent by mail this week to high-profile critics of President Trump. A law enforcement official identified the suspect as Cesar Sayoc Jr., 56, of Aventura, Fla. Mr. Sayoc, a registered Republican, has a lengthy criminal history that includes being accused of threatening to use a bomb, public records show. Speaking at the White House, Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials for quickly arresting a suspect. The arrest was announced hours after the authorities said they had discovered two more pipe bombs, one addressed to Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and the other to James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, law enforcement officials said today. A total of 12 packages have been found so far. Here’s what we know and don’t know. • News analysis: President Trump abandoned calls for national solidarity on Thursday, lashing out at those he says are responsible for today’s toxic political environment. • Conspiracy theory: Within hours of the first bomb’s discovery, some conservative media outlets suggested the devices were a plot concocted by the left. The kingdom’s public prosecutor acknowledged for the first time on Thursday that the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi appeared to have been premeditated. • Changing story: The Saudis have now settled on a conclusion that most of the world reached some time ago. Here’s how their account evolved. • A push from Turkey: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pressed Saudi Arabia today to reveal who gave the orders to kill Mr. Khashoggi, who was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, and demanded that its leaders explain what happened to his body. • Saudi Arabia’s war: The Khashoggi case has brought renewed focus to Saudi tactics in Yemen, where millions have been pushed to the brink of starvation. Please be warned that the photographs with this piece, of emaciated children, are unsettling. Here’s why The Times decided to publish them. Andy Rubin, the creator of Android mobile software, was given a hero’s farewell when he left the company in October 2014. What Google didn’t make public was that he had been accused of sexual misconduct. Mr. Rubin, who received a $90 million exit package, was one of three executives accused of misconduct that the company protected over the past decade, a Times investigation found. • CBS inquiry: The Times also looked at the state of the TV network’s investigation into accusations of sexual misconduct since top figures including Leslie Moonves and Charlie Rose left. President Trump is considering taking executive action to bar migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the U.S. at its southern border, according to people familiar with the plan. The proposal is expected to be quickly challenged in federal courts. • Mobilizing the troops: The Defense Department is preparing to send as many as 1,000 active-duty soldiers to help secure the border. If the Democrats win a majority, there will be a lot of talk about doing things differently. Be wary of the hype, our chief Washington correspondent warns. • The Tip Sheet: In today’s edition of our analysis of the midterm elections, Republicans are spending more than they’d like to defend seats that were once reliably red. • Climate change: Voters in Washington State will consider whether to charge companies and utilities for their carbon emissions. It would be the first state to do so. • The U.S. economy is on track for its fastest growth since 2005 this year, as the gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter. • President Trump is proposing to lower prescription drug prices by basing them on their costs in other countries. • Megyn Kelly’s future at NBC seems to be in danger. She didn’t appear on her morning show on Thursday. Ms. Kelly caused an uproar this week with comments about blackface Halloween costumes, but her words weren’t surprising to those who know her career, our TV critic writes. • This month’s drop in the stock market has been unsettling for investors. But it could signal good news for workers, our senior economics correspondent writes. • U.S. stocks were up on Thursday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Have adult acne? These products can help. • A reader asks: My kids say I drink too much. Do I? • Recipe of the day: Looking for a side dish? Go with broccoli and scallions with a Thai-style vinaigrette. • New York’s failing schools Mayor Bill de Blasio promised in 2014 to “shake the foundations of New York City education” and improve the 94 poorest-performing schools. Now, the administration appears ready to give up on the program, which will have cost $773 million by the end of this school year. • Jerry Seinfeld on tough times in comedy The 64-year-old is to announce today the return of his residency at the Beacon Theater, with 20 shows next year. He spoke to us about the state of the comedy world, including scandals of his peers’ own making. • The week in good news She helped save her husband’s life, then gave birth to their child. It’s one of seven stories that inspired us. • Quiz time! Did you keep up with this week’s news?

It’s long, but enlightening.” Emily Post, the longtime authority on etiquette in American life, was born on Oct. 27, 1872, according to her biographer. (There is some disagreement about the date; the 1960 Times obituary for her said 1873.) Although Mrs. Post addressed questions about champagne flutes and special forks, her advice covered a broad range of topics. Her book “Etiquette” was published in 1922. It’s in its 19th edition, updated by Mrs. Post’s great-great-grandchildren. So is Mrs. Post still relevant? Philip Galanes, the Social Q’s columnist for The Times since 2008, says she is. Her advice intended to help people feel comfortable in a social sphere that wasn’t their own, something we can still benefit from today, Mr. Galanes said. “She was holding out the fantasy of a lot more social mobility. It was important to her that we be armed with a way to behave,” he said. “A lot of the things she’s writing about seem so antique, because the Duchess of Sussex is not inviting us to tea.” But if you do find yourself invited by royalty, don’t worry about picking up the wrong piece of cutlery. “Manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others,” Mrs. Post said. “If you have that awareness, you have good manners, no matter what fork you use.” Claire Moses wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

2018,"Pipe Bombs, Plastics, Jamal Khashoggi: Your Friday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. More bombs in America’s mail, Denmark’s fence against swine, and a sexual misconduct accusation against a former Google executive. Here’s the latest: • At least 10 bombs. One common thread. Law enforcement officials found three new explosive devices, two addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden and the other to the actor Robert De Niro, a day after similar devices were sent to other prominent critics of President Trump. Above, Mr. De Niro’s production studio in New York. None of the explosives have harmed anyone so far, and it’s unclear who is behind them. But they have sent shock through the nation’s political and news media establishments. Investigators are focusing on southern Florida, where it is believed some of the packages originated. Here’s what we know and don’t know so far. Mr. Trump first condemned the attempted attacks and called for unity. But he was soon back to attacking the “fake news.” And a conspiracy theory blaming leftists for the bombs jumped to the mainstream from the fringe with unusual speed, our columnist writes. _____ • A democratic institution forced out of Hungary. Central European University, founded in 1991 as a bastion for liberal values, says it has stopped accepting students at its Budapest campus, after it could not resolve a legal dispute with the increasingly authoritarian Hungarian government. The government has made the university a symbol of one of the men who helped build it, the Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, who was also a target of the U.S. pipe bombs this week. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s far-right prime minister, has long vilified Mr. Soros and his efforts to promote democracy. Above, an anti-Soros campaign poster in Budapest. The university says it still hopes for a last-minute deal but otherwise will have to shut down the campus. _____ • “We have to enter the imagination of a pig.” That’s the task of Bent Rasmussen, who’s in charge of building a fence along Denmark’s border with Germany to keep out that country’s wild boars. It’s part of a $20 million campaign in Denmark, a pork exporter, to combat African swine fever. Above, a Danish pig farmer. The disease is harmless to people but potentially devastating in domestic pigs and the wild boars that might spread it. Critics say the fence could hurt wildlife, be misused against refugees or violate the E.U. ethos of free movement. There are also questions about whether the fence would even work. In other pig news, a rare breed of swine in China could be saved by a Rockefeller scion after the pigs’ farm was threatened by a modernization drive. _____ • Ninety percent of the world’s plastic waste ends up in the ocean, according to the World Economic Forum. Reflecting growing environmental concerns, the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly to ban single-use plastics like straws, plates and cutlery by 2021. The ban must still be approved by the E.U.’s member states. Above, volunteers cleaning up waste in London. _____ • Almost 200 years after his death, a bare-knuckle boxer is back in the limelight. Bill Richmond, who was born a slave in the U.S. in 1763 but spent most of his life in Britain, has been called the world’s first black sporting superstar. Archaeologists are searching for his remains beneath Euston Station in London, where a burial ground is being excavated as part of the station’s redevelopment, above. For Mr. Richmond’s fans, this is a big moment. “I want more people to know his story,” his biographer said. • Google protected three male executives accused of sexual misconduct over the past decade.

Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and Amazon both missed estimates. • Don’t forget! Daylight saving time in most European countries ends early Sunday — although the E.U. is considering whether to end the practice. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor said the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was “premeditated,” yet another shift in the country’s explanation for his death.

Mary Shelley’s enduring novel has made the rare journey from literature into common myth, becoming an allegory for everything from gender equality to racism. • As a Polish Jew during World War II, Rose Zar survived the Holocaust by hiding where those pursuing her would never look — the home of a Nazi commander in Krakow. She never got a New York Times obituary, until now. • In memoriam: Tom Jago, 93, a British liquor executive who was part of the team that developed Baileys Irish Cream; and Wanda Ferragamo, 96, who oversaw the expansion of her husband Salvatore Ferragamo’s Italian shoemaking business into a global luxury brand. • Opinion would like to know how you feel about Brexit.

2018,"Pipe Bombs, Saudi Arabia, Vladimir Putin: Your Thursday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Pipe bombs target the U.S. left, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince condemns the Khashoggi killing and President Trump is being spied on. Here’s the latest: • Bombs sent to American politicians. Pipe bombs were sent to several prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as to CNN’s offices in New York, prompting an evacuation, pictured above. No one was hurt. A law enforcement official said the devices were similar to one found Monday at the home of the billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor George Soros. New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, called the bombings “an effort to terrorize.” President Trump condemned the “despicable acts,” ziplining past months of his own divisive campaign comments to urge the nation to come together. The political world paused for calm in a dangerously inflammatory climate. There is no word yet on any perpetrator or motive. In Opinion: George Soros’s son Alexander blames an increasingly partisan political environment where opponents are demonized. _____ • A “heinous crime.” Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, above, denounced the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and insisted that Saudi Arabia and Turkey were working together to bring the perpetrators to justice. Current and former Western officials suspect he is in fact the chief perpetrator. The statement, made during an investor conference in Riyadh, was the crown prince’s most public attempt to separate himself from the men suspected of carrying out the killing, which include some of his own aides. Here’s why Mr. Khashoggi’s death has had such broad geopolitical implications. _____ • Nuclear saber-rattling. Russia has warned of a new arms race if the U.S. pulls out of the landmark Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty — and there were the rumblings of one on Wednesday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, above, said any European nation that chose to deploy U.S. missiles would face a “possible counterstrike” in a war. The U.S. is expected to withdraw from the 1987 treaty in coming weeks and begin producing the banned short- and intermediate-range missiles. Should the U.S. pull out, Mr. Putin said, Russia will deploy the very missiles that the U.S. accuses it of deploying, in violation of the treaty. “We don’t want a new Cold War,” said the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, playing down the prospect that European nations — many of which object to scrapping the treaty — would host any missiles. Separately, U.S. officials have concluded that both Russia and China are eavesdropping on President Trump’s phone conversations — but he continues to have unsecured chats. _____ • Scientists want to scrub carbon from the air. A leading scientific body urged the U.S. government to begin research on technologies that would remove vast quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, in an effort to slow climate change. Until now, scientists said large temperature increases could be prevented mainly by reducing fossil-fuel use and switching to other energy sources. Above, steel works in Port Kembla, Australia. But, according to a dire U.N. study released this month, time is running out. Experts now believe that taking carbon out of the air may be necessary — but they haven’t yet figured out how to do that economically or at a big enough scale. The new report came out on the same day that New York’s attorney general sued Exxon Mobil — accusing it of deceiving investors about the effects of climate change on its business. _____ • History in miscellany. During the construction of a new subway line in Amsterdam, archaeologists discovered 700,000 artifacts, dating from 119,000 B.C. to 2005. Mostly, it’s trash — Renaissance trash and prehistoric trash and just-barely-retro trash, as well as the guard plate of a samurai sword (there’s a theory about that). Clockwise from top left, chain mail and a dagger from the 15th century, a hand grenade from 1916 and caltrops, spikes used in the Middle Ages to impede military foes.

Vermont is famous for spectacular fall foliage, which was at or just past peak color last week. But a leaf-peeping drive there can also offer a subtler sight, one that figures unexpectedly in an issue now in the news: Native American identity. Just off Route 100A sits Plymouth Notch, birthplace of Calvin Coolidge — a tiny village, pictured above, preserved largely as it was on the night in 1923 when Warren Harding died suddenly in California and Coolidge’s father had to wake him up and swear him in as president. A visitor center display notes Coolidge’s actions against racism and the Ku Klux Klan, then at its zenith. His more lasting civil rights contribution, though, may be signing the Indian Nationality Act. Many of the country’s 300,000 indigenous people were already naturalized by then, but the 1924 act made their citizenship automatic at birth without diminishing tribal identity or rights, an important step toward equality. Coolidge is remembered today mainly as Silent Cal, taciturn to a fault. (Dinner hostess: “Sir, I bet a friend that I could get you to say more than two words.” Coolidge: “You lose.”) So the act may have suited him in another way: Its text is just one sentence long.

A suspicious package addressed to the actor Robert De Niro was found today at his production company in Manhattan, the eighth such device found in four days. None of the devices harmed anyone, and it was not immediately clear if they could have done so. The incidents unsettled a country already on edge in a partisan political climate that has intensified as the midterm elections approach, prompting a number of politicians to call for calm. • Confusion and false alarms: A device discovered at CNN’s New York City headquarters prompted a mass evacuation and a flurry of reports across the country about suspicious packages. • “See how nice I’m behaving?”: President Trump condemned the bomb scares and called for unity, but later said that journalists should “set a civil tone.” Foreign agents routinely listen in on personal calls made by President Trump, who has refused to give up his iPhone despite warnings that it is not secure, officials said. • Eavesdroppers: The Chinese often listen in on the president’s calls to his friends, hoping to glean insight that might help them influence administration policy. Aides have warned Mr. Trump that the Russians are also listening. The migrant caravan making its way through Mexico began with left-wing activists and politicians in Honduras who wanted to damage the country’s government. “The violence and poverty is expelling us,” a call to join the caravan said. But it has become an embarrassment for Honduras, and a useful political tool for President Trump and other Republicans who hope to capitalize on anxieties about immigration ahead of the midterm elections. • Debunking viral images: We took a closer look at misinformation about the caravan that has been circulating on social media. • A policy surprise: Key agencies were not informed about the White House’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy before it was announced. District attorney races used to fly under the radar, and candidates would argue over who was the toughest on crime. But criminal justice policy has become more popular with voters, and many candidates are now running on plans to end mass incarceration. As overhaul efforts have stalled at the federal level, new attention — and donor money — has been drawn to some local races. • Testing Tennessee: Phil Bredesen, a moderate Democrat, is running a cautious Senate campaign in a state that has shifted sharply to the right. • The Tip Sheet: In today’s analysis of the midterm elections, some vulnerable Democrats have distanced themselves from their party’s left-wing elements. • The Campaign Reporter: Sign up for updates from our politics correspondent. Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor said today that the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident journalist, was “premeditated,” the latest change to the kingdom’s official story about how he died. The announcement said the conclusion was based on new information from a joint Saudi-Turkish investigation taking place in Turkey. • Enduring doubt: Saudi officials initially said Mr. Khashoggi died accidentally during a “fistfight” inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. • Stocks dropped again on Wednesday, worrying investors about the end of a decade-long bull market. Here are five tips if you’re thinking of unloading your own stocks, and here’s a snapshot of global markets today. • New York’s attorney general sued Exxon Mobil, accusing the company of defrauding investors by playing down how much climate change could impact its business. • Unlike some competitors, Apple has so far avoided the problem of fake news by using humans to decide which stories its tens of millions of readers will see.

Al Roker, the weatherman, said that Ms. Kelly “owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country.” Though Ms. Kelly apologized on her show, the crisis has exposed rifts between her and others at the network. • Red Sox are halfway to another title A 4-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers gave Boston a 2-0 lead in the World Series, bringing them one step closer to what would be their fourth title in 15 seasons. • Inside a beloved Colombian candy factory Bon Bon Bums, lollipops produced in 16 flavors, are the star product of the candy company Colombina.

Just off Route 100A sits Plymouth Notch, birthplace of Calvin Coolidge — a tiny village preserved largely as it was on the night in 1923 when Warren Harding died suddenly in California and Coolidge’s father had to wake him up and swear him in as president. A visitor center display notes Coolidge’s actions against racism and the Ku Klux Klan, then at its zenith. His more lasting civil rights contribution, though, may be signing the Indian Nationality Act. Many of the country’s 300,000 indigenous people were already naturalized by then, but the 1924 act made their citizenship automatic at birth without diminishing tribal identity or rights. Coolidge is remembered today mainly as Silent Cal, taciturn to a fault. (Dinner hostess: “Sir, I bet a friend that I could get you to say more than two words.” Coolidge: “You lose.”) So the act may have suited him in another way: Its text is just one sentence long.

2018,Pittsburgh Killing Aftermath Bares Jewish Rifts in Israel and America,"BEIT SHEMESH, Israel — The slaughter of 11 Jews in Pittsburgh elicited responses in Israel that echoed the reactions to anti-Semitic killings in Paris, Toulouse and Brussels: expressions of sympathy, reminders that hatred of Jews is as rampant as ever, reaffirmations of the need for a strong Israel. But Saturday’s massacre also brought to the surface painful political and theological disagreements tearing at the fabric of Israeli society and driving a wedge between Israelis and American Jews. Israel’s Ashkenazi chief rabbi took pains to avoid the word “synagogue” to describe the scene of the crime — because it is not Orthodox, but Conservative, one of the liberal branches of Judaism that, despite their numerous adherents in the United States, are rejected by the religious authorities who determine the Jewish state’s definitions of Jewishness. And the attacker’s anti-refugee, anti-Muslim fulminations on social media prompted some on the Israeli left — like many American Jewish liberals — to draw angry comparisons to views espoused by the increasingly nationalistic leaders who now hold sway in their governments. The result has been a striking and lightning-fast politicization of the sort of tragedy that until now had only galvanized Jews across the world — not set them at one another’s throats. Here in Israel, the decades-old animosity between left and right has reached new levels of enmity in recent years. Ultra-Orthodox parties that play a kingmaker’s role in the right-wing government are pressing to increase their influence and that of Jewish law on daily life, sparking bitter fights over everything from who serves in the military to whether trains can run and stores can open on the Sabbath. Jews from liberal American denominations feel increasingly alienated from Israel’s state-run religious life. [Growing anti-semitism has stunned American Jews.] With the Israeli government, like many across Europe, also taking a decidedly nationalistic turn, the election of President Trump has only compounded that strife, widening the rift between Israeli and American Jews. Politically liberal American Jews have been repelled by Mr. Trump’s solid support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and by Mr. Netanyahu’s effusive embrace of Mr. Trump and his granting of a wish-list’s worth of political gifts. They range from scrapping the Iran nuclear agreement to repeatedly punishing the Palestinians and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. All of that, and more, bubbled up when one of Israel’s most influential politicians, Naftali Bennett, leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, jumped on a plane to Pittsburgh in his capacity as minister of diaspora affairs. Mr. Bennett gave voice only to unifying ideals: “Together we stand, Americans, Israelis — people who are, together, saying no to hatred,” he told a vigil there Sunday night. “The murderer’s bullet does not stop to ask, ‘Are you Conservative or Reform, are you Orthodox? Are you right-wing or left-wing?’ It has one goal, and that is to kill innocent people. Innocent Jews.” No sooner had Mr. Bennett’s plane departed Ben-Gurion Airport than he was assailed by liberal Israeli critics, who among other things resurfaced a 2012 Facebook post in which he had accused leftists of promoting “crime and rape in Tel Aviv” because they wanted to allow African migrants who had entered the country illegally to stay. “Is the Trump-supporting, African-migrant-bashing Naftali Bennett really the best person to represent Israel in Pittsburgh right now?” wrote Anshel Pfeffer in Haaretz, the liberal daily. Others cited a pro-Jewish Home party text message sent to Haifa residents in advance of Tuesday’s municipal elections. It warned Jewish voters fearful of “the flight of young Jews” and a “takeover” by “the sector”— shorthand for Israeli Arabs — to vote for the Jewish Home slate. “That’s almost word-for-word the spirit of ‘Jews will not replace us,’” said Dahlia Scheindlin, a left-wing political consultant in Tel Aviv, recalling the chant of neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. Even Michael Oren, the American-born deputy minister from the right-of-center Kulanu party, faulted Mr. Bennett for having sided with the ultra-Orthodox Israeli rabbinate, which refuses to recognize non-Orthodox denominations as sufficiently Jewish to participate fully in Israeli religious life. “Liberal Jews were Jewish enough to be murdered, but their stream is not Jewish enough to be recognized by the Jewish State,” Mr. Oren wrote in Hebrew on Twitter, adding: “I call on Minister Bennett not to suffice with condolences, but to recognize liberal Jewish streams and unite the people.” On the right, veteran activists in Likud, Mr. Netanyahu’s party, circulated an email on Sunday — which Mr. Netanyahu’s aides and party leaders disavowed within hours — noting that the Pittsburgh killer had denounced the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which “encouraged immigration” and “acted against Trump.” “Did we or did we not say that the Left is guilty of encouraging anti-Semitism?,” wrote the email’s author, who responded to queries but declined to identify himself. Many Israelis, of course, reacted with horror and grief as they tuned into coverage of the Pittsburgh massacre. In Beit Shemesh, a largely ultra-Orthodox city 20 minutes west of Jerusalem, Elisheva Gutman, 24, a social worker, said her parents had vacationed in Pittsburgh two weeks earlier and had attended Sabbath services down the street from the Tree of Life synagogue, the killing site. “When they go to Europe, my father takes off his kipa and puts on a hat,” for fear of attack, Ms. Gutman said. “It’s not supposed to be that way in the U.S.” Chaim Zaid, 62, a paramedic from Kedumim, a West Bank settlement, said the shooting belied Israelis’ ideas of the United States as a “paradise” for Jews. “You think the big U.S., with the big F.B.I., will protect them, and nothing will change,” he said. “But that was a change point. My sister lives in Brooklyn and was afraid to come to my home. So Sunday morning I sent her a message: ‘Rivka, you were afraid to come to me?’” If other Israelis were quick to score political points over the Pittsburgh killings, though, in a sense they had been preparing for this moment. The disagreements between American and Israeli Jews have been piling up. Only last week, the Jewish Federations of North America’s yearly General Assembly drew hundreds of Americans to Tel Aviv for a three-day conference focused on the strains in the relationship, titled “We Need to Talk.” In a provocative keynote, the head of Israel’s largest real estate company, Danna Azrieli, recited the litany of friction points. For Americans, she said, there are Mr. Netanyahu’s effusive embrace of Mr. Trump, whom most American Jews oppose; the Israeli occupation and Jewish settlements on the West Bank, which many American Jews believe block peace with the Palestinians; Mr. Netanyahu’s reneging on a deal last year to significantly upgrade and grant equal status to a mixed-gender, Reform and Conservative prayer space at the Western Wall; and Israel’s new nation-state law, which opponents call racist and anti-democratic because it enshrines the right of national self-determination in Israel as “unique to the Jewish people.” For Israelis, Ms. Azrieli said, Americans don’t serve in the Israeli army, pay Israeli taxes or live under the threat of rockets, but also don’t let those realities stop them from trying to impose their views on Israelis. Long as it was, that list had big omissions. Israelis on the left would add, at a minimum, the Netanyahu government’s warming up to increasingly authoritarian leaders in countries like Hungary and Poland, and its demonization of the Hungarian-born, liberal Jewish financier George Soros — who also is a frequent target of anti-Semitic attacks in the United States and Europe — for underwriting activist groups that oppose Mr. Netanyahu’s policies. Mr. Netanyahu’s own son even posted a meme attacking Mr. Soros with anti-Semitic imagery that drew praise from the likes of David Duke. And Israelis on the right would add their lingering resentment of American Jews’ support for the Iran nuclear deal struck by President Obama, which Israelis saw as a matter of survival, according to the author Yossi Klein Halevi, a New York-born Jerusalemite. Mr. Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute, said the Pittsburgh shootings had exposed an even deeper and more worrisome divide between the two populations. “Each sees the other as in some sense threatening its most basic well-being,” he said. “American Jews don’t understand the depth of the Israeli sense of betrayal over the Iran deal. And Israelis don’t understand why American Jews regard Trump as a life-and-death threat to the liberal society that allowed American Jewry to become the most successful minority in Jewish history.” How damaged is the relationship? In her keynote, Ms. Azrieli felt compelled to plead, “Don’t give up on our country,” adding: “Don’t walk away because your liberal sensibilities are insulted. Don’t assume that nothing can change. Things do change — just painfully, slowly, incrementally, and with all of our help.” And yet among Israeli leaders, some already have given up on American Jews, said Mr. Oren, the deputy minister and a former Israeli ambassador in Washington, who also cited some American Jews’ opposition to President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. “One school of thought is: ‘These are our people, we have to do everything possible to reach out.’ The second school says:, ‘It’s too late, they’re gone. After Iran, after Jerusalem, if we have limited resources we should invest in our base — evangelicals and the Orthodox.’” “The first school, which is mine, is a beleaguered school,” Mr. Oren said. “The burden of doubt is on us; we have to prove that we’re still correct. It’s not easy.” In Beit Shemesh, Zion Cohen, 66, a mall manager, lamented the acrimony. “I’m Likud, but what’s happened between Israel and America, I’m against it,” he said. “I know it’s painful to Jews in America how Israel acts toward them. The influence of the Orthodox and Haredim on the Israeli government is a catastrophe. And we need help from the Jews of the U.S., especially given how much anti-Semitism there is now in the world.” He added: “We have to unite the whole Jewish people.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of a man shown standing in front of a mall in Beit Shemesh. He is Eli Peretz, not Teretz. The article also misidentified who avoided using the word “synagogue” to describe the scene of the crime. It was Israel’s Ashkenazi chief rabbi, not its Sephardic chief rabbi.",The New York Times
2018,Pittsburgh Synagogue Massacre Suspect Was ‘Pretty Much a Ghost’,"PITTSBURGH — Robert Bowers, the man accused of gunning down 11 congregants in a virulently anti-Semitic rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue, was an isolated, awkward man who lived alone and struggled with basic human interactions, neighbors and others who knew him said on Sunday. “He was in his own little world,” said Jim Brinsky, 46, a friend from childhood. Mr. Brinsky said he and Mr. Bowers, 46, grew up together but that he never met Mr. Bowers’s parents and got the impression that Mr. Bowers had a difficult home life. As teenagers, he said they built pipe bombs and blew up watermelons and trees as pranks. They drifted apart by the time they got to Baldwin High School, where Mr. Brinsky said Mr. Bowers wore a camouflage jacket and drifted alone through the halls. Mr. Bowers is not listed in any activities or sports in his 1989 junior-class yearbook, and he does not appear in the next year’s book as a senior at all. It is unclear whether he graduated. “He was pretty much a ghost,” Mr. Brinsky said. His next-door neighbors also described him as a man who was barely there. In the shabby one-bedroom ground-floor apartment where he had lived for about a year and a half, Mr. Bowers made such an insubstantial impression on his next-door neighbor, Kerri Owens, that she forgot his name soon after he introduced himself. Mr. Bowers said he worked as a truck driver and needed the apartment primarily to store his stuff, Ms. Owens said. “I felt bad because he’d say, ‘Hi, Kerri,’ and I wouldn’t remember his name,” Ms. Owens said. “When I saw his picture on the news, my stomach dropped. I couldn’t believe it.” Quiet as he appeared to be in person, he loudly spewed murderous hatred and bigotry online. For months online before the shooting, Mr. Bowers unleashed a torrent of anti-immigrant and anti-Jewish invective and conspiracy theories on Gab, a social media network that has been embraced by white nationalists. He had 21 guns registered in his name and carried out the massacre with an AR-15-style assault rifle and three handguns, the authorities have said. Ms. Owens said she was stunned by all of this, echoing the shock of other neighbors who told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Mr. Bowers had been a quiet neighbor and had lived with his maternal grandfather until the grandfather died in 2014. The apartment building where Mr. Bowers had most recently lived is in Baldwin Borough, a hilly, middle-class neighborhood in the Pittsburgh area that is a 30-minute drive south of the Tree of Life Congregation in Squirrel Hill. His apartment is one of 11 in the grandly named McAnulty Acres, a two-story building that includes the offices of a plumbing company. A rusty barbecue smoker and an empty beer bottle sat outside on Sunday. Law enforcement officials had cordoned off the street on Saturday and robots entered Mr. Bowers’s apartment, said a neighbor, Jerry, who declined to provide his full name. On Sunday, there were no signs of police or F.B.I. activity. Mr. Bowers seemed to leave for work for a few days at a time, but when he was home, neither Mr. Bowers or his teal-blue sedan moved, Ms. Owens said. Her fiancé, Chris Hall, 28, said he sometimes came home late from work to see Mr. Bowers sitting in his car, smoking and apparently listening to the radio. “There was nothing about him, not even a bumper sticker on his car,” Mr. Hall said. Ms. Owens would sometimes hear him through her wall, chatting with the landlord when he went to drop off his rent — in cash — at the landlord’s office around the corner. But he had no guests. He lived alone. He watched television late into the night sometimes. He used a post office box instead of the mailboxes at the apartment complex. But nothing about his behavior concerned her, and their conversations never went beyond pleasantries, Ms. Owens said. “I don’t know if he had any friends, anywhere,” Mr. Hall said. She said she last saw his car when she went to work on Friday morning, but does not know whether he was still there when she returned that night. Like much about him, the memory is opaque. “It’s very unsettling knowing all that stuff that was used to hurt those people was on the other side of the wall,” she said. “I didn’t see any signs. I can’t even comprehend that he had that much hate and seemed so normal.”",The New York Times
2018,Pittsburgh Synagogue’s Rabbi Speaks of Horror and Healing,"In a blog post last summer, three months before a man with an AR-15-style assault rifle opened fire on his Pittsburgh congregation, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers railed in sharp tones against the failure of lawmakers to address gun violence. “I fear that the status quo will remain unchanged,” Rabbi Myers wrote, invoking the words of Rabban Gamliel, a second-century Jewish scholar: “Be wary of the authorities! They do not befriend anyone unless it serves their own needs.” On Monday, as Rabbi Myers sought to make funeral arrangements for congregants killed in the mass shooting on Saturday, some other Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh rejected a proposed visit by President Trump, saying his rhetoric encouraged white nationalist violence. But Rabbi Myers offered a message of healing. “The president of the United States is always welcome,” he said in an interview on CNN. “I’m a citizen, he’s my president. He is certainly welcome.” Mr. Trump later confirmed plans to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday. Rabbi Myers, who was hired just over a year ago by the Tree of Life congregation, which numbers a few hundred families, has found himself serving as a spiritual leader to an entire country in shock after the massacre, which left 11 people dead. At a vigil in Pittsburgh and in a series of television interviews, the rabbi has warned that the attack was aimed at the American ideal of freedom of worship, and at America itself. He has also reiterated his belief that good will prevail over evil. He awoke on Monday to hundreds of emails from strangers, he told CNN, sent by people of all faiths and from all around the world. He has said the synagogue will not close down or cede any ground to violence. And he has called on politicians to avoid hateful rhetoric. “My cup overflows with love,” Rabbi Myers said at the vigil in Pittsburgh on Sunday, according to an account in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “That’s how you defeat hate.” Rabbi Myers made the first 911 emergency call on Saturday morning when the gunman began his deadly assault. Until two months ago, he rarely carried his cellphone on the Sabbath, when some Jewish people avoid using technology and electronics, he has said in interviews. But at a training session in August, he said, a security expert told him he should start. “I learned a number of important things from him,” Rabbi Myers said in an interview Monday on “Good Morning America.” “He said, ‘Rabbi, it’s a different world, and you need to carry it.’ I’m so grateful for his presence, and teaching me.” The rabbi said that about five minutes after the Saturday service began, at 9:45 a.m., he heard a loud sound in the synagogue lobby on the floor below him. It sounded like a coat rack had fallen, he recalled. But then he heard another loud bang. “It was apparent to me — instinct — that it was not the sound of a piece of metal falling down,” he said. “It was rapid fire.” With about 12 people in the sanctuary, Rabbi Myers said, he yelled for everyone to drop to the ground and stay quiet. He then started to evacuate the congregants to safety, beginning with a handful of people at the front of the sanctuary. There were still eight people in the room, all in the rear. The gunfire was getting louder. The gunman was moving closer to the sanctuary. Seven of the eight people were killed, he said, and the eighth was injured; she is expected to recover. “There was no way for me to get back,” Rabbi Myers said on CNN. “I live with that, the sounds that are seared in my brain, for the rest of my life.” The gunman also killed four others at the synagogue, members of two other congregations who use the same building. Rabbi Myers grew up in Newark and started his career as a teenage soprano in his congregation’s choir, according to The Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle. When Mr. Myers was 15, the cantor at his synagogue had a stroke just before the High Holy Days, and Mr. Myers was called to step in and lead the choir. He has served much of his professional career as a cantor and a Jewish educator in a congregation on Long Island and later in Ventnor City, N.J. He sought ordination as a rabbi to improve his job prospects, he told The Chronicle, at a time when American synagogues were consolidating. One reason he was an appealing candidate when the Tree of Life/Or L’Simcha congregation in Pittsburgh sought a new rabbi was his ability to perform the roles of both rabbi and cantor. At the vigil on Sunday, The Post-Gazette reported, Rabbi Myers told an audience of more than 2,000 people in the Soldiers & Sailors Hall that when he could not sleep after the attack, he reminded himself of the portion of the 23rd Psalm about one’s cup overflowing. Then he began singing “El Malei Rachamim,” a funeral lament. An earlier version of this article misstated the title of the funeral lament sung by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers at a vigil in Pittsburgh on Sunday, according to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. It is “El Malei Rachamim,” not “El Rachamim.”",The New York Times

After years of separating themselves from former President Barack Obama’s health care law, vulnerable Senate Democrats are increasingly focused on a single issue: saving the Affordable Care Act. • The Tip Sheet: Our daily analysis of next week’s midterm elections looks at President Trump’s campaign rallies after a week of violence. • Turnout: What if everyone voted? Some political scientists say it would make American democracy more representative. Others aren’t convinced that matters much. Read more here. A Lion Air flight carrying 189 people from Jakarta to the Indonesian city of Pangkal Pinang crashed into the sea today, prompting questions about why the Boeing 737 went down despite clear skies. “I suspect all the passengers are dead,” one rescue official said. • New setback: A spokesman for the country’s air navigation authorities said the aircraft had requested permission to turn around minutes after takeoff. Indonesia’s fast-growing aviation sector has been troubled by safety problems for years. • The World Trade Organization is to hear a U.S. complaint against China today. It’s one of the headlines to watch this week. • IBM, seeking an edge in cloud computing, is acquiring Red Hat, the largest distributor of the open-source operating system Linux, for $34 billion. • The media industry wasn’t built to withstand baseless broadsides from President Trump and others, our columnist writes. • U.S. stocks were down on Friday, after disappointing earnings reports from Amazon and Alphabet.

You might have the same mix of bitter and sweet reactions.” “There must be some deeper meaning to this,” Vidkun Quisling, the deposed Norwegian “minister-president,” wrote to his brother from prison, as he waited to face a firing squad in October 1945. “In fact, I am dying a martyr’s death.” History disagreed. Last week, the Times obituary for Joachim Ronneberg, a Norwegian resistance leader who helped block the Third Reich from developing nuclear weapons during World War II, recalled the Quisling era, a painful chapter in Norway’s history. Born in 1887, Quisling served in the military and did diplomatic and humanitarian work before rising through the ranks of the Norwegian government. An enthusiastic supporter of German National Socialism, he began collaborating with Hitler in the 1930s to put Norway under Nazi control. Almost immediately, Quisling’s distinctive name became synonymous with “traitor.” Winston Churchill, addressing delegates from Allied nations in 1941, spoke of the “vile race of Quislings — to use a new word which will carry the scorn of mankind down the centuries,” groveling before Hitler to curry favor. After Germany’s surrender in 1945, Quisling was arrested. During his administration, nearly half of Norway’s small population of Jews were sent to concentration camps. He was executed on Oct. 24, 1945, in Oslo. His last words: “I am innocent.” Nancy Wartik wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

2018,"Pittsburgh, Lion Air, Milky Way: Your Tuesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: Social media companies have been unable to handle the vast quantities of disinformation and hate speech on their platforms, and the consequences have become clear in the past week. Cesar Sayoc, who was accused of sending explosive devices to more than a dozen prominent critics of President Trump, appears to have been radicalized by partisan posts on Twitter and Facebook. And Robert Bowers, who is charged with killing 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, posted about his hatred of Jews on the social network Gab. “Social media is emboldening people to cross the line and push the envelope on what they are willing to say to provoke and to incite,” said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “The problem is clearly expanding.” • In court: Prosecutors indicated that they would seek the death penalty for Mr. Bowers. • In Pittsburgh: Funerals for the victims of the synagogue shooting begin today. Mr. Trump is also scheduled to visit the city this afternoon. • Rifts within Judaism: The massacre exposed political and theological disputes between Israeli and American Jews. • Mail bomb case: The federal authorities said Mr. Sayoc had a list of about 100 possible targets, including an editor at The Times. This midterm election cycle has already set several records: for the number of women running for Congress, the number of women to win primaries and the number of female candidates of color. But women are struggling to raise as much campaign money as men, particularly if they are Republican, challenging incumbents or running in places where the opposing party has a big advantage. • The Tip Sheet: Our daily analysis of next week’s midterm elections looks at a House district in South Carolina that has become an unexpected battleground race. • News analysis: President Trump and conservative commentators and politicians have tried to elevate a caravan of migrants in southern Mexico as an election issue. More than 5,000 active-duty military troops will be deployed to the southern border by the end of this week, the Defense Department announced on Monday. • Citizenship at birth: Mr. Trump said in an interview published today that he was preparing an executive order to end the constitutionally protected system under which a child born in the U.S. is granted citizenship, regardless of the nationality or legal status of the child’s parents. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been in office for 13 years, is Europe’s most powerful leader, but she said on Monday that Germany must “get ready for the time after me.” Ms. Merkel said she would step down as the leader of her conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union, in December and would not seek re-election in 2021. Some commentators said elections could be held as early as next year. • Possible successors: We look at some of those who are positioning themselves to lead the Christian Democrats. • Opinion: An editor for a German newspaper writes that Ms. Merkel’s departure could offer much-needed resolution about where the country is headed. Researchers worldwide once hailed Dr. Piero Anversa’s work as revolutionary: He devised a way to grow heart cells to replace those lost in heart attacks or heart failure. But other scientists couldn’t reproduce the results. After a five-year investigation, officials concluded that more than 30 studies Dr. Anversa’s lab produced over more than a decade contained falsified or fabricated data and should be retracted. Dr. Anversa stands by his work, and says he is the victim of sabotage by a colleague. • From the archives: In 2001, The Times published a front-page article about Dr. Anversa’s research. The Lion Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea on Monday, possibly killing all 189 people aboard, was relatively new, having flown only about 800 hours. The aircraft model, the Boeing 737 Max 8, has quickly become a mainstay of carriers replacing older 737s. • Cause of the crash: The Lion Air flight had erratic changes in speed, altitude and direction, which could indicate problems with instruments used to calculate airspeed and altitude. • Travel resources: The U.S. and the European Union evaluate aviation safety standards of countries and airlines around the world. Here’s where to find that information. • The dismissal of one of six charges against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein this month has raised questions about the rest of the case. • Hospitals in rural areas keep closing. Beyond the health consequences for people living nearby, the closings can also have an economic toll. • Cellphone-size books meant to be read horizontally in one hand could transform American publishing. • Never heard of Bytedance?

The end of shoe rationing was announced on this day in 1945. Less conventional options than rationing had also been considered, such as forcing “manufacturers to produce shoes that would be so unattractive that people would not buy them unless absolutely needed,” according to a government statement introducing the program in 1943. The government ultimately chose the annual cap instead. Australia, Britain, Ireland, Italy and New Zealand put similar limits in place. Although the U.S. program was announced with little warning to limit a run on shoes, its stipulations were far-reaching. Babies were not exempt. Aside from the quantity limits, the program also curtailed the styles and colors of shoes available, with black, white, town brown and army russet in, while wingtips and heels exceeding two and five-eighths inches were out. After the program ended, some consumer behaviors that developed during the rationing period stuck, with casual shoes that had become popular under rationing continuing to drive demand. A 1946 article in The Times reported that the year was expected to be one of the “best-shod” in history.

2018,"Pittsburgh, Midterms, Whitey Bulger: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump visited Pittsburgh as the first funerals began for the 11 victims of Saturday’s synagogue massacre. Above, a service for David and Cecil Rosenthal. Many officials and residents made clear his visit was not welcome. About 1,000 protesters gathered holding signs criticizing Mr. Trump’s divisive language with slogans like “Words matter,” below. The president and the first lady were accompanied by his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both practicing Orthodox Jews. They guided the president’s response to the shooting, our reporters learned. Their first stop was at the Tree of Life synagogue, where the president and his family lit candles and were greeted by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, the congregation’s spiritual leader. Dozens of rabbis let us know how they and their congregations have reacted to the massacre. “I will certainly devote my sermon this week to the need to mourn and bury our dead, then to go on to build a future life,” one rabbi said. Officials said the suspect, Robert Bowers, used an AR-15 assault rifle and three Glock .357 handguns in the shooting spree, among 10 guns he owned legally. _____ 2. With the midterms just a week away, President Trump has made a series of attention-getting moves. Above, a rally in Murphysboro, Ill. Before he went to Pittsburgh, the news site Axios published an interview in which he said he was preparing an executive order to nullify the guarantee of U.S. citizenship for everyone born in the country. The president’s plan was immediately rejected by legal scholars and legislators, including some from his own party. “You obviously cannot do that,” the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, told a Kentucky radio station. Birthright citizenship, our Supreme Court reporter notes, was embedded in the 14th Amendment in large part to overrule the Dred Scott decision of 1857. That infamous Supreme Court ruling said black slaves were property and not citizens, and barred their descendants from citizenship. _____ 3. This election cycle has already set several records: for the number of women running for Congress, the number of women to win primaries and the number of female candidates of color. But women are still struggling to raise as much campaign money as men, particularly if they are Republicans, are challenging incumbents or are running in places where the opposing party has a big advantage. Above, Rashida Tlaib, the Democratic candidate in Michigan’s 13th Congressional District. The Tip Sheet: Our daily analysis of next week’s elections takes a look at a House district in South Carolina that has become an unexpected battleground. _____ 4. China has a potent economic weapon it could deploy in its trade war with the U.S. It involves the number seven. China’s currency has been losing value since April. Now it hovers around seven renminbi to the dollar, a psychologically important threshold. It’s also the weakest the renminbi, above, has been since the beginning of the financial crisis. If the currency depreciates further, it could give Chinese exporters a price advantage and undermine U.S. tariffs. The Trump administration doesn’t like that idea. But China has good reason to avoid it, too, and it appears to have acted in recent weeks to prop up the renminbi. Currencies may be potent weapons, but they are blunt ones — and they can boomerang against those who use them. _____ 5. A galactic trap door? Scientists in Germany and Chile say they have new evidence that a dark entity in the constellation Sagittarius is a supermassive black hole, a bottomless grave with a mass equal to more than four million of our suns. The giveaway: gas clouds traveling at roughly 30 percent of the speed of light, circling the center of the Milky Way, above. In the coming months, a network of giant telescopes will try to produce an image of the black hole itself. _____ 6. Violent storms lashed the length of Italy early this week, leaving at least 11 people dead. In Venice, locals and tourists tottered on raised walkways throughout the city, while others waded through thigh-high water and even took a swim in historic St. Mark’s Square. Ferocious winds drove the high tide there to more than five feet above average sea level, one of the highest levels ever recorded. It was the highest flood in a decade, though far short of the record set in November 1966. _____ 7. Whitey Bulger, the legendary Boston crime boss turned F.B.I. informant, was killed by fellow inmates at a West Virginia prison, workers there said. He was 89. Mr. Bulger, who was serving two life sentences for 11 murders, had eluded police for 16 years before he and a companion were arrested in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2011. Above, a 1953 mug shot. Topmost in his code of the streets was said to be: Never squeal to the authorities. That facade crumbled with the disclosure that he was a federal informer against the Mafia for 15 years. _____ 8. The Lion Air jet that crashed in Indonesia on Monday, killing all 189 people aboard, was brand new. The aircraft model — the Boeing 737 Max 8 — was introduced only last year, although it has quickly become a mainstay of carriers replacing older 737s. Above, sorting through crash debris. So what went wrong? Experts are looking to see if an underlying problem, either mechanical or human or both, may have caused the crash. The flight had erratic changes in speed, altitude and direction, which could indicate problems with instruments. Investigators are focusing attention on small metal tubes used to calculate airspeed and altitude. The U.S. and the European Union evaluate aviation safety standards of countries and airlines around the world. Here’s where to find that information. _____ 9. Can tiny books change the way we read? A new series of pocket-size novels should feel familiar to people used to scrolling smartphones with their thumbs. The books, printed on paper as thin as onion skin, are meant to be held sideways and read with one hand. The first to be released in the U.S. are novels by John Green, author of “The Fault in Our Stars.” The tiny books are based on dwarsliggers (from the Dutch “dwars,” or crosswise, and “liggen,” to lie), a format that has become popular across Europe. But don’t worry: The effect, Mr. Green said, is much closer to a book than a cellphone. “The whole problem with reading on a phone is that my phone also does so many other things.” _____ 10. Finally, who’s to say what tastes awful? The Museum of Disgusting Food, a touring pop-up exhibition now in Sweden, is challenging taste buds across the globe. Say you’ve already tasted haggis, Vegemite, Spam and durian fruit (banned on planes and in some hotels). Would you try fruit bat soup, maggot-infested cheese or Chinese mouse wine? Disgust is hard-wired, but it’s highly subjective, researchers say. “People can’t believe that we take their favorite foods and put them in the museum,” said its director, who hopes to stimulate discussion about sustainable protein sources.

2018,"Pittsburgh, Migrant Caravan, Yemen: Your Weekend Briefing","Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. Details are emerging in two attacks that have shaken the country. One is being investigated as a hate crime: the mass shooting at a prominent synagogue in Pittsburgh during a service on Saturday morning. At least 11 people were killed — including a 97-year-old woman, siblings and a husband and wife. Denunciations poured out. “Jews targeted on Shabbat morning at synagogue, a holy place of worship, is unconscionable,” the head of the Anti-Defamation League wrote on Twitter. The suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, is in custody. We’re working to find out more about him, but on a social media site friendly to extremists, he expressed virulent anti-Semitism and xenophobia. He appeared to criticize President Trump for being a “globalist” and not focusing on a national “infestation” of Jews. ____ 2. The second attack brought another kind of domestic terrorism to light. A man in South Florida was arrested and accused of sending explosive packages to at least a dozen of President Trump’s most prominent critics, including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The suspect, Cesar Sayoc Jr., 56, above, is an ardent Trump supporter with a lengthy criminal record and a social media trail of furious posts about immigrants, the news media and Democrats. The case brings a new intensity to next week’s midterm elections and deep concerns about the stoking of partisan fury on themes often espoused by Mr. Trump. Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. ____ 3. The midterms may swing on some of those issues. If you see disinformation out there — like a “false flag” conspiracy theory that surfaced in the past week — let us know. In the final stretch, we went to Georgia to profile the candidate above, Stacey Abrams, who could become the nation’s first black female governor; to Tennessee to meet the centrist trying to defeat a conservative; and to Pennsylvania to examine the obstacles to a “blue wave.” Check out our Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis. On the campaign trail, President Trump has been focusing on the migrant caravan moving through Mexico (see the next item) and attacking Democrats and the news media. He and other Republicans also hailed third-quarter economic growth. We are, however, seeing a gender gap in perceptions of the economy: Across the board, men are more positive and women more dubious. ____ 4. The migrant caravan: About 7,000 people from Central America are trekking north in defiance of the American and Mexican authorities, the largest group so far. The photo above was taken Saturday, as the caravan moved between Chiapas and Oaxaca. President Trump is considering closing the border. Our columnist has debunked five of the false, misleading and unproven claims about the migrants, and the reporting team traveling with them details their desperation. ____ 5. Saudi Arabia’s long, brutal campaign in Yemen is gaining new attention as the Saudis struggle to contain international outrage over the high-profile killing of a Saudi dissident. Our reporter and photographer bear witness to the war’s devastation. We know the images are hard to look at. Here’s why we are publishing them. The embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington did not respond to questions about the country’s policies in Yemen. But the Saudis made another shift on the killing of the dissident, Jamal Khashoggi, acknowledging that his killing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul appeared to be premeditated. The shrunken Western attendance at an investor conference in Riyadh demonstrated how the episode has overshadowed the ambitions of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. ____ 6. A new Cold War? There’s a new dynamic in international relations, resembling the Cold War of decades past but including China along with the U.S. and Russia. Above, Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia met in September. Spies from Russia and China are listening in on President Trump’s iPhone calls, according to current and former American officials who cited tips from people inside foreign governments and intercepts of foreign officials’ communications. China, they said, is learning what arguments tend to sway Mr. Trump and who has his ear. Mr. Trump dismissed the report. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last president of the Soviet Union, warned in an Op-Ed that Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon arms-related arrangements, including a nuclear treaty signed in 1987, was setting off a new arms race. ____ 7. Google gave one of its leading executives, Andy Rubin, above, $90 million in an exit package and a hero’s farewell in 2014 — after he was accused of sexual misconduct by an employee, an investigation by The New York Times found. Mr. Rubin helped build Android, the software used in 80 percent of the world’s smartphones. And Google protected two other accused executives over the last decade. Google employees asked pointed questions and expressed anger over the company's actions at a weekly staff meeting. Just months after employee protests pushed Google to drop a Pentagon contract, Microsoft announced it would sell military and security agencies whatever technology they require. ____ 8. The World Series got weird. For 7 hours and 20 minutes, the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers tried to settle Game 3 of baseball’s biggest contest. Eighteen pitchers took the mound, 46 players passed through the field, and no game in the history of major league playoffs went longer. Finally, in the 18th inning, the Dodgers’ Max Muncy, above, slammed a difficult pitch over the left-field fence for a 3-2 win. But the Red Sox came back on Saturday to win Game 4 and move to within one victory of the title. Follow our live coverage of Game 5 here. ____ 9. A senator’s spokesman and veteran of Democratic campaigns died of colon cancer at 30. Tyrone Gayle, above at his wedding in May, was the Washington press secretary for Senator Kamala Harris. He had worked on the 2016 presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. ____ 10. Big winners. Two Powerball tickets that matched all six numbers — 8, 12, 13, 19 and 27 — were sold in Iowa and New York City. The jackpot to be split is nearly $688 million. And someone won $1.54 billion from Mega Millions. That ticket was sold in South Carolina, one of a handful of states where lottery winners can remain anonymous, so it’s possible we’ll never know who bought it. Experts say that might be for the best. If you’re planning to win a future lottery, here is useful advice. ____ 11. Finally, don’t miss our Best Weekend Reads. This week, we include our colleague Nicole Phillip’s essay on being black outside the U.S.; the plan to save tigers by reclassifying them; and the women who have replaced nearly half of the 201 powerful men brought down by #MeToo.

2018,"Pittsburgh, Venice, Whitey Bulger: Your Wednesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump visits Pittsburgh, Venice floods and a notorious mobster meets a grisly fate. Here’s the latest: • A day of mourning and protest in Pittsburgh. People came together in synagogues and cemeteries, united in grief over the Jewish worshipers killed in a shooting but split over a visit by President Trump. Mr. Trump began his visit at the Tree of Life synagogue, where the 11 people were killed by a man spewing anti-Semitic rage and carrying four guns, which were purchased legally. Mr. Trump went with the first lady — above center with a rabbi, Jeffrey Myers — and his Jewish daughter and son-in-law, who have helped shape his response to the massacre. In the usually placid neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, now anguished by the attack, protesters gathered with messages like “President Hate is not welcome in our state.” Meanwhile, in a new pledge to his anti-immigrant base, Mr. Trump said he would end birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed under the Constitution. Doing so by executive order would be a highly dubious tactic, at odds with legal consensus. But ahead of midterm congressional elections on Tuesday, Mr. Trump is throwing everything at the wall, our correspondent writes. _____ • The City of Water, underwater. Much of Venice was flooded as ferocious winds lofted the sea to one of the highest levels ever recorded in the city. Hurricane-force winds and small tornadoes lashed Italy this week from Piedmont to Sicily, and the comprehensive mayhem left at least 11 people dead and many more injured or stranded. Emergency officials were scrambling as fish swam in the streets of one town, century-old felled trees blocked roads in Rome and the mayor of Naples described “an atmospheric earthquake.” In Venice, residents and tourists tottered on raised walkways or just waded, and many shops and restaurants were inundated. There are now fears that the salt water will corrode some city treasures, and while a divisive, multibillion-dollar system of floodgates could have helped, it’s unfinished. _____ • The center isn’t holding. A suddenly urgent question is who will be able to counterbalance forces tearing at Europe’s unity in the eventual absence of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who said she would retire after her term. Ms. Merkel, above, has stood in the way of the populists who took over in Italy, Hungary and Poland. But now even Germany is considered politically unstable, and there is panic at the core of the E.U. — though critics of her support for austerity or migrants are happy to see her go. An analyst told us that Ms. Merkel “created European consensus out of nothing,” and everyone wonders, “My God, who will do the job for her?” _____ • Blegh. An unusual and controversial exhibition in Malmo, in the south of Sweden, invites visitors to explore their notions of food through sheer repulsion. “What’s interesting is that disgust is hard-wired biologically,” said Samuel West, the lead curator at the Disgusting Food Museum, a touring exhibition. “But you still have to learn from your surroundings what you should find disgusting.” Consider the lobster, once regarded as unfit for prisoners. Or maggot-infested pecorino, which some people willingly eat. More than 80 items from 35 countries are displayed. Australians have been galled by the inclusion of Vegemite, Americans by root beer. Above, pork brains. • The eurozone grew 0.2 percent from July through September compared with the previous quarter, according to the E.U., and Italy reported no growth in the third quarter as manufacturing fell. All of this is likely to heighten Rome’s budget dispute with the bloc. Above, a factory in Italy. • Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, announced $15 billion in profits for the latest quarter, a new high. But the memory-chip boom driving profits is looking ephemeral. • Richard DeVaul, a director at the X unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, resigned after he was accused in a Times article of sexually harassing a female job applicant. • China’s currency has been losing value since April, and further depreciation could give Chinese exporters a price advantage and undermine U.S. tariffs. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The Kepler spacecraft, NASA’s farsighted space telescope, has run out of fuel and will be left to drift around the sun for eternity. Above, an artist’s conception of the Kepler-444 system, showing five of the 2,662 planets discovered during Kepler’s nine-year mission. [The New York Times] • The end of austerity? Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced more planned spending on health, education, defense and even fixing potholes, but he said it hinged on reaching a Brexit deal. [The New York Times] • Experts are puzzled and worried over what caused a pristine new Boeing plane carrying 189 people to crash under calm, sunny skies in Indonesia. [The New York Times] • The notorious American mobster and F.B.I. informant Whitey Bulger, 89, was beaten to death in prison in what may have been a mob-ordered hit. [The New York Times] • The trial began in Germany for a former nurse serving a life sentence for murder, on charges that he killed an additional 100 patients at two hospitals. [The Associated Press] Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Recipe of the day: All you need for a flavorful roast chicken are salt, pepper and herbs. (Sign up for our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter for more excellent recipes.) • The introverted traveler’s guide to sightseeing. • Tips on meaningful friendships, from our newsletter for college students and recent graduates. • In the port city of Nantes, France — once a hub in the global slave trade — students visit to see the country’s only memorial to the thousands of slaves taken by French ships to the New World. Above, an art installation at a nearby museum, where many slavery artifacts are kept. • Christer Strömholm, a Swedish photographer, fell in with a group of transgender women in Paris in 1959. His photographs are an intimate and sensitive portrayal decades before such depictions were widely seen. • A Halloween treat: With Luca Guadagnino’s remake of “Suspiria” showing in the U.S. and set for release beyond, we looked at the 1977 original and eight other Italian horror classics. India is set to unveil the world’s tallest statue today, a bronze figure of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who played an important role in the country’s independence from Britain in 1947. It’s also Patel’s birthday. At 597 feet (182 meters) tall, the statue, above, is almost twice the total height of the Statue of Liberty, including the pedestal, in New York City. At the time of his death in 1950, Patel was described by The Times as part of “India’s idolized triumvirate” alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. After independence, he became India’s first deputy prime minister and faced the outsize task of weaving together all of India’s disparate parts. As sectarian violence exploded and one of the greatest migrations in history unfolded at India’s borders, the fate of more than 500 princely states hung in the balance. Those states were never fully under British control, ruled instead by indigenous monarchs. Had they decided to remain autonomous, the newly independent country could have been further divided. Patel negotiated with the different rulers and, within two years, persuaded all but a few to join the Indian union. The states that initially resisted eventually gave in to pressure, although one, Jammu and Kashmir, is still contentious today. The statue dedicated to Patel is called the Statue of Unity.

2018,Planning to Vote in the November Election? Why Most Americans Probably Won’t,"MADISON, W.Va. — Lula Hill voted in just about every election once she became old enough in 1952. Her coal mining family of registered Democrats believed that elections were like church services: You didn’t skip them. But over time, her sense of civic obligation faded. Mines started laying people off. Opioids started poisoning her neighbors. As her town lost its vigor, Ms. Hill watched as smiling politicians kept making promises and, in her view, growing richer. By the late 1990s, when political leaders — Democrat or Republican — talked about the greater good, she no longer believed them. “I just got to the point, I said, ‘I’m not going do it anymore,’” said Ms. Hill, sitting on a couch in the lobby of the hotel she owns and runs, the Hotel Madison, 30 miles south of Charleston. “I just can’t vote for any of them in good conscience.” She has not voted since 1996 and said she has no intention of starting in November. Ms. Hill is hardly alone in West Virginia, a state with one of the lowest rates of voter turnout in the country and where the Democratic senator, Joe Manchin III, faces a tough race. This year’s election carries enormous political stakes, but if history is any guide, the vast majority of eligible voters will stay home on Election Day. Slightly more than a third of eligible voters turned out across the country in the last midterm elections, the lowest share since 1942, according to Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, who runs the United States Elections Project that tracks voting data back to 1789. And while turnout has been higher in this season’s special elections and primaries, experts say that in November it is still unlikely to break out of the middling range it has been stuck in for nearly a century. People typically cite one of two reasons for why they do not vote in midterm elections: they are either too busy or not interested, according to Dr. McDonald’s analysis of responses to the Census Bureau from 2000 to 2016. “The costs of voting are not terribly high compared to the way they’ve been at times in American history,” said Benjamin Highton, a political scientist at the University of California at Davis, who has studied voter ID laws. “People simply have other things they are more interested in, like making ends meet on a day-to-day basis.” Americans used to vote at much higher rates — sometimes above 80 percent in the second half of the 19th century. In those years, a multitude of parties brought a vibrancy to political life. Party machines helped people with jobs, fuel bills and funeral expenses in return for votes. But turnout declined sharply from 1900 through the 1940s, as the power of the party machines declined and voter suppression shut out blacks in the South and many immigrants in the North. The rate of voting has never recovered. The last time more than half of eligible voters turned out for a midterm election was 1914, said Dr. McDonald. The United States’ turnout in national elections lags behind other democratic countries with developed economies, ranking 26th out of 32 among peers in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to the Pew Research Center. Perhaps the most significant change has been in who votes. Unlike in the 19th century, voter turnout is now highly correlated with class. More than 80 percent of Americans with college degrees vote compared with about 40 percent of Americans without high school degrees, according to Jonathan Nagler, a political scientist at New York University and co-author of a 2014 book, “Who Votes Now.” “There is a class skew that is fundamental and very worrying,” said Alexander Keyssar, a historian at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who wrote “The Right to Vote.” “Parts of society remain tuned out and don’t feel like active citizens. There is this sense of disengagement and powerlessness.” The effect, he said, has been a more unequal society and “more of a gap between what we say this country is about and what it really is.” Until about the 1980s, West Virginia had some of the highest voting rates in the country. In 1952, the first year Ms. Hill voted, 77 percent of West Virginians turned out, according to Dr. McDonald, a stunning number by today’s standards and higher than the national rate then of 62 percent. Voting back then was festive, a social occasion at the polls. People put on their nice clothes. Women brought cornbread and pinto beans. “You’d go in there and there’d be people everywhere,” said Albert Baisden, a retired trucking company owner in Dingess, recalling election times in the 1950s. “You had to fight your way in through the crowd to get to vote. You couldn’t hardly get a parking place. Everybody was grabbing you by the right arm, by the left arm, saying, ‘Vote for me!’” Back then, this patch of West Virginia was more vibrant, as well. Ms. Hill recalled that her hotel was full almost every night, mostly with men working in construction for the mines. She remembers they used to take off their work boots in their trucks and change into slippers so they would not track mud on her carpet. But in the span of a generation, the town’s sense of community fell apart, she said. Ms. Hill said she has had 27 flat-screen TVs stolen from her rooms. Eventually she stopped replacing them. Even the cushions on the couch in her lobby were stolen; a lawn chair pad is in their place. “We have nothing now,” Ms. Hill said, sitting in the lobby of the hotel, an airy room with tall ceilings and wall paneling adorned with teapots and cuckoo clocks. “It’s all gone.” Voting went down, too. The midterm election of 1998 was the first time in Ms. Hill’s life she did not vote. She was not alone: Only 29 percent of eligible West Virginians voted that year, according to Dr. McDonald’s data. The strongest predictor of voting, according to Dr. Highton, is political engagement. Those who are interested in politics — whether they grew up in families that followed it or developed interest as an adult — tend to vote, he said. “It’s like being a sports fan,” he said. “Some people just aren’t.” Clara Bender, 69, a waitress in Madison, has never voted. “I just never got into it,” she said, as she cleared a table for a customer. “I got married, had babies — just never had the time.” Ms. Bender said she did not know enough about the candidates to choose. But she is public spirited in other ways. As a young mother, she got involved in her children’s school. She raised her granddaughter and helped her open the restaurant where their family now works. These days, she spends most of her time being a patient listener for a community whose heart is broken. The woman she was just serving, she said, had a son addicted to drugs and was crying when she walked in. “I have to make time for them,” she said. As for never voting: “It just didn’t bother me.” To Carrena Rouse, an English teacher at Scott High School, that is a bitter pill, especially after watching the extraordinary energy over the statewide teachers’ strike earlier this year. “People say my vote won’t do any good, but I beg to differ,” said Ms. Rouse, who was among the thousands of teachers who went on strike. She believes the state is dominated by coal money and politicians who pander to it precisely because people let it be by not voting. And she thought the teachers’ strike and the outpouring of public support they got would translate into more votes in the state’s primary in May. But she was disappointed that only 26 percent of registered voters went to the polls, “after everything that happened,” she said. The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate. “That’s the disturbing part,” she said. “I don’t want to use language like ‘betrayed,’ but pretty close.” Still, the voting rate on Primary Day was up by nearly a third from the primary in 2014, according to West Virginia’s Office of the Secretary of State. More young people went to the polls, too. According to TargetSmart, a political analytics company in Washington, D.C., turnout for people under 30 was up by half in the West Virginia primary compared with the primary in 2014, but was still less than the national rise. Many younger people interviewed in Madison last month said that they would vote, but that they did not spend much time thinking about politics or consider it a part of their identity. Jennifer Anderson, a worker at Miller Brothers Pharmacy, said she did not know the political orientation of her colleagues. She said she would probably vote, but she has not yet decided for whom or for which party. “Some of my issues are on one side, and some are on the other,” she said. Turnout in West Virginia was higher in May despite a new voter ID law the state put in effect in January. Generally, new laws around voting access can make it easier or harder to vote, but researchers say they do not explain much about the country’s lackluster turnout. About 2 percent of people told the Census Bureau they did not vote in the last midterm election because of problems with registration, according to Dr. McDonald. For Ms. Hill, national politics feels distant these days, as if events are happening on another planet. “I’m just to the point where I’m so disillusioned over what goes on,” she said of politicians in Washington and her state. “All they are doing is slinging mud at each other. If they would just stop the squabbling and think of the people.” Besides, she had more important things to think about. She was busy washing sheets and cleaning rooms. A pipe was leaking and she needed a plumber. “My sister said, ‘Sis, we didn’t vote so we don’t have the right to complain,’” she said. “That may be true, but I might have felt even worse voting for some of these people.”",The New York Times
2018,Plants Can’t Talk. But Some Fruits Say ‘Eat Me’ to Animals.,"Two national parks in Uganda and Madagascar presented researchers with a natural experiment to understand how plants have adapted to appeal to animals that spread their seeds. As the sun rises over Kibale National Park in Uganda, red berries and orange figs hang in the rain forest’s canopy. They’re waiting for monkeys, apes or birds to scan the foliage, eat the ripe fruit and either spit or defecate seeds far from their sources, spreading their next generation to a new location. Nearly 2,000 miles away, in the similarly mountainous rain forests of Madagascar’s Ranomafana National Park, yellow berries or fragrant, green figs await lemurs, the frugivores of this jungle. They’ll search the forest all night for their feast, later scattering the seeds. Over millions of years of natural selection, these plants have developed ways to communicate with animals through their fruits, new research suggests, saying something like “choose me.” With traits evolved to match each animal’s sensory capacities or physical abilities, fruits can signal dinner time in the jungle, and further their plant’s survival as a species. “When I first learned that plants, in a way, behaved — that they were actually communicating information to animals — my mind exploded,” said Kim Valenta, an evolutionary ecologist at Duke University and co-author of a study published recently in Biology Letters investigating the relationship between fruit color and animal vision. Dr. Valenta and her colleague Omer Nevo, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Ulm in Germany who published another paper about scent last week in Science Advances, are working to understand how plants have adapted to appeal to animals that spread their seeds. What they are revealing is that plants deserve more credit — and that the intricate relationships between plants and animals may be critical for understanding and preserving their shared habitats. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] For more than a century, biologists have wondered why fruits from closely-related plants have such different appearances, and how animals know which ones to eat. The prevailing hypothesis has been that animals could have influenced fruit traits — like shape, location on a tree, presentation on a branch or odor and color — through natural selection. The easier it is for fruit-eaters to identify ripe fruits, the better the chance for both to survive. The animal eats, and the parent plant reproduces — by using the animals as gardeners — without lifting a root. In a similar way, many flowers tailor their petal shape, color, texture or nectar’s scent or flavor to attract often a single pollinating species. Scientists accept that these flower traits could result from coevolution, because the relationships are so specific. But they’ve had questions about plants reproducing through seed dispersal. How can you pin a fruit’s particular traits to an animal when many different animals, with their own evolutionary adaptations, interact with the same fruits? Though traits like shape are easier to study, without proper tools to measure color and odor, much research has relied on human perceptions and may have overlooked how other animals may experience the world. For the researchers, these parks in Uganda and Madagascar offered the perfect natural experiment. With similar landscapes and related plants bearing different-looking fruits that feed animals with very different sensory abilities, the researchers could reveal how animal senses may have influenced the contrasting colors of ripe fruits against foliage. The monkeys and apes in Uganda have tricolor vision like humans, and the birds have even better vision. But most lemurs in Madagascar can only see the blue-yellow spectrum — they’re red-green colorblind, and rely more on their strong senses of smell for many behaviors. So the researchers collected ripe and unripe fruits and foliage and analyzed their colors with a spectrometer. With a model based on the visual capacities of the seed-dispersing animals, they also determined who was most likely to detect different fruit colors contrasting against an assortment of backgrounds. They found the colors of each fruit were optimized against their natural backdrops to meet the demands of the visual systems of their primary seed dispersers. In Uganda, fruits contrasting with foliage in colors on the red-green spectrum — say that red berry in a green cluster — popped for birds and monkeys whose eyes can see them. But in Madagascar, fruit with blue-yellow contrasts — like those yellow berries — could be best detected by red-green colorblind lemurs (and some birds, too). The researchers also know that lemurs dedicate large areas of the brain to olfaction, helping them communicate with one another and pick mates — often in the dark. To these excellent smellers, a fragrant brown fig might also stand out. In Dr. Nevo’s scent study, his team collected hundreds of ripe and unripe fruits from Ranomafana — about a third dispersed solely by visually challenged lemurs and the rest by other lemurs and the park’s few visually gifted birds. He suspected the lemur-eaten fruits would have a greater difference in odor after they ripened than the bird-eaten fruits. To find out, he extracted their odors using the “semi-static headspace technique.” Sealed in oven bags, chemical fruit odors built up and were then pumped out, trapped and analyzed. They confirmed that fruits dispersed solely by lemurs produced more chemicals and a greater assortment of compounds upon ripening. And in the wild, lemurs spent more time sniffing these same fruits with big differences in ripe versus unripe odors. To the researchers, this suggested the differences could signal, “I’m here. Eat me,” to creatures otherwise possibly unable to see them. These results may only be extreme, localized cases supporting the hypothesis that plants and seed-dispersers evolve together. But the researchers see additional clues in a relationship between forest elephants in the Uganda park and Balanites wilsoniana, a tree that might not be able to survive without them. When ripe, Dr. Valenta said she could detect the “fermented gym sock” odor of the tree’s large fruits for miles. Elephants — with huge noses and more olfactory receptor genes than any other known animal on Earth — gobble up the fallen fruits (they may make them feel tipsy too). Only elephants can swallow the fruits and defecate the equally large seeds whole. And this plant won’t reproduce unless it passes through an elephant’s gut, Dr. Valenta said. This type of mutual dependence is seen in well-established flower-pollinator relationships, but it’s rare to find in fruit-seed-disperser relationships. Further study may offer additional evidence that animal senses influence fruit traits. The traveler’s palm in Madagascar highlights another plant advertisement strategy targeted at animals. In other parts of the world, related birds of paradise plants produce red or yellow coated seeds easily detectable to birds. But in Madagascar, where traveler’s palm is native, the seeds are brilliant blue and particularly detectable to aye-ayes, a kind of rat-cat-bat-looking lemur with an enhanced capacity to detect ultraviolet light, according to Dr. Valenta. The seeds of many plants — the traveler’s palm likely included — also contain a laxative, urging whatever eats them to hastily expel them, undigested, “with a nice pile of runny fertilizer,” said Jonathan Drori, author of “Around the World in 80 Trees.” Aye-ayes and other lemurs are also pollinators, using their strength to open the palm’s sturdy nectar packages, ensuring the plant can produce seeds in the first place. “If something happened to those lemurs, those trees, at least in the wild, would become extinct,” Mr. Drori said. Interactions like these remind us that plants are active members of a complicated and fragile ecosystem — not just landscape. “We’re only just beginning to understand how much plants and animals mean to one another,” Dr. Valenta said, “which to me is just a signal that it’s more important to conserve the entire thing intact.” An earlier version of this article misattributed the source of a description about the visual capabilities of an aye-aye lemur. It was described by Kim Valenta, not Jonathan Drori. The article also mischaracterized Mr. Drori's description of the laxative effects of traveler's palm seeds on animals. He said the seeds of many fruits have that effect, not specifically those of the traveler's palm. A picture caption in an earlier version of this article, using information provided by a researcher, misstated the location of a chimpanzee eating figs. The chimpanzee was in Uganda's Budongo Forest, not Tai National Park in the Ivory Coast.",The New York Times

The 87-year-old, who nurtured the literary careers of everyone from John Cheever and Toni Morrison to Nora Ephron and Bill Clinton, collects midcentury plastic handbags — caramel-colored purses, pearly Lucite minaudières — a style that flourished during the post-World War II plastics boom. He has amassed over 400 pieces on road trips around the United States, storing them in a dedicated closet in his Manhattan townhouse. “I never went on real vacations. Instead, I’d drive — and drive and drive — across Iowa, Indiana or somewhere in the South, visiting flea markets. Seeing these places broke down a lot of my ignorance of the country.

2018,"Playing Up Support Among Hispanic Voters, Trump Takes Aim at Immigration Laws","MESA, Ariz. — President Trump blasted immigration laws and border security at a boisterous rally here on Friday, all while playing up his support among Hispanic voters. He distorted the current immigration system and the migrant caravan nearing the United States and deployed the inflammatory language of his 2016 campaign, even resurrecting the phrase “bad hombre,” a term he coined as a presidential candidate. “You’ve got some bad people in those groups,” he said. “I’ll tell you what, this country doesn’t want them.” But even as chants of “build the wall” erupted repeatedly throughout the night, Mr. Trump described his prevailing popularity with Hispanic voters, polling the crowd to see how many were in attendance. The response was lukewarm. “We’re doing very well with Hispanic Americans,” the president said. “They want safety at the border. They want great jobs.” Mr. Trump’s messaging about immigration extended to the rest of his day in Arizona. After the signing of a presidential memorandum about water projects in the West, the president asserted, in response to a question about the migrant caravan heading to the United States-Mexico border: “A fairly big percentage of those people are criminals. It’s not happening on my watch.” Hours later, during a round-table discussion with military officials and representatives from defense companies at Luke Air Force Base, he contended, “These are not little angels coming into our country.” When pressed about his assertion that the migrants headed for the United States were criminals, Mr. Trump scoffed, but offered no specific evidence. “These are tough, tough people, and I don’t want them, and neither does our country,” he said. The rally on Friday, the second of three this week on the West Coast, was part of a broader effort by the president to harness his popularity among core supporters to help Republican candidates in the midterm elections. He pointed to the accomplishments of Representative Martha McSally of Arizona, who is locked in a highly contentious race for Senator Kyrsten Sinema’s seat. A vote for Ms. McSally, he said, “would be the second-greatest vote you’ve ever cast.” “The first-greatest vote,” he added, “was for me.” In attacking Democrats, Mr. Trump mischaracterized his opponents as pushing for “open borders.” “Democrats believe our country should be a giant sanctuary city for criminal aliens,” he said. (Over all, Democrats support border security measures but have opposed the border wall he has sought to build.) And he returned to an assertion that he has pushed at campaign rallies in recent weeks: that the Democrats are a mob, intent on exacting revenge on Mr. Trump for his election victory. “The Democrats have become an angry, unhinged mob, determined to get power by any means necessary,” he said. “Vote for the jobs, not for the mobs. Just do it.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Playing the Long Game for the Supreme Court ,"Conservatives emerged from the Bork battle bent on winning control. It took 31 years. How will progressives respond? Contributing Opinion Writer It was 31 years ago this week, on Oct. 23, 1987, that the Senate rejected the Supreme Court nomination of Robert H. Bork. Thirty-one years and a world ago: eight senators crossed party lines, with six Republicans joining 52 Democrats in voting against confirmation, while two Democrats joined 40 Republicans in supporting President Ronald Reagan’s nominee, one of the country’s best known and most outspoken conservative intellectuals. It was the biggest margin of defeat for any Supreme Court nominee in history. The seat intended for Judge Bork — the seat that had been occupied for 15 years by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., an appointee of President Richard Nixon and the “swing” justice of his time — went eventually to Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice Kennedy turned out to be the non-Bork, voting to preserve the right to abortion and writing a series of gay-rights rulings that culminated with the 2015 decision that announced a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. We know that now, but we didn’t know it then. The urgent question that emerged from the ashes of Judge Bork’s defeat and that awaited an answer as Justice Kennedy took his seat in February 1988 was: Who won the Bork battle? If Anthony Kennedy turned out to be, as some predicted, “Bork lite” or “Bork without the bite,” voting as a Justice Bork would have voted, then the answer would be clear. The Reagan conservatives, despite having to tack against the wind of a rising Democratic tide, would have prevailed. The Democrats had retaken the Senate in the 1986 midterm elections, meaning that a fading Reagan administration, weighed down by the Iran-contra scandal, had lost the opportunity for legislative accomplishment. But President Reagan, filling a fourth and final vacancy, would have nonetheless managed to capture the Supreme Court. But if, on the other hand, Justice Kennedy turned out to embrace a constitutional vision notably more inclusive than Judge Bork’s, if he rejected Judge Bork’s doctrinaire originalism, then the scorched-earth Bork battle would be deemed worthwhile and the liberal side would be seen to have prevailed. [Want to join the debate? Follow us on Instagram at @nytopinion.] Indeed, that’s been the triumphalist liberal narrative for a generation. I’ve channeled it myself, writing it more times than I’d like to count about how the Bork confirmation hearing became the equivalent of a national constitutional teach-in that provided the country with a working definition of the constitutional mainstream. By that, I mean the right to women’s reproductive autonomy, a role for the government in taking account of race in order to achieve meaningful equality, an approach to constitutional interpretation that wasn’t shackled to the framers’ original understanding of their 18th-century project. Judge Bork testified about his views for five spellbinding days. That the Senate rejected him despite his abundant professional qualifications had to mean that the public understood those views as outside the mainstream and thus unsuited for the Supreme Court. And that narrative was most likely accurate early on as three Republican-appointed justices — two named by Ronald Reagan and one by President George H.W. Bush — united against all predictions to provide the narrow margins that preserved the right to abortion, kept organized prayer out of public school graduation ceremonies and overturned a Colorado constitutional provision that discriminated openly against gays. The Bork battle, it seemed, had made the Supreme Court safe for a progressive reading of the Constitution. But could anyone except a still-sleeping Rip Van Winkle make such a claim today? Consider two news items from last week that serve to illuminate the current reality. One was the revelation that the Heritage Foundation, a deeply conservative policy shop in Washington that has partnered with the Federalist Society in providing President Trump with judicial nominees, was running a secretive training academy for ideologically vetted judicial law clerks. The foundation suspended the program after it came to public attention. The other was the confirmation hearing the Republicans of the Senate Judiciary Committee held (the Democratic senators boycotted it) for Allison Jones Rushing, the president’s nominee for a vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Ms. Rushing’s conservative credentials are impeccable, including ties to the Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious-right litigating organization. Ms. Rushing clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas and for Neil Gorsuch when he was a federal appeals court judge; those clerkships evidently accounted for the “incredible wealth of judicial experience” praised by one of her Judiciary Committee supporters, Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina. She graduated from law school 11 years ago. She is 36 years old. How do those two developments relate to each other and to the legacy of the Bork battle? Following Judge Bork’s defeat, conservatives didn’t waste time licking their wounds. They got busy building the infrastructure necessary to accomplish their thwarted goals. The Federalist Society had been founded five years earlier by a handful of law students; Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia, then a law professor, both spoke at its first symposium. The organization offered the perfect vehicle for cultivating a new generation of young conservative lawyers to enter the pipeline, serving as law clerks by the side of growing numbers of conservative judges and — like Justice Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, both former Supreme Court law clerks — becoming judges themselves. Allison Rushing is, naturally, a Federalist Society member. If she is confirmed, and there is no reason to expect otherwise despite a so-so “qualified” rating from the American Bar Association, she will be a viable Supreme Court candidate for the next 20 years. And while the Heritage Foundation doesn’t have a presence in the law schools, its boot camp for law clerks is clearly intended to keep the pipeline flowing. In other words, conservatives emerged from the Bork battle determined to win the war. They are succeeding in doing something that progressive are simply bad at: playing the long game. A long game takes a long time — 31 years, in this case — and requires electoral victories, a necessary but not sufficient condition. Conservatives, once in office, never relaxed their focus on the courts. The Trump administration’s front-loading of judicial nominees is simply a ramping up of an established pattern. But this isn’t the end of the story. Rather, it’s only the beginning of the next chapter, as judicial progressives figure out how to rise from their ashes. This fall’s bitter confirmation fight has left the Supreme Court with something it doesn’t often have — the public’s attention. The court, at least for a while, is no longer an insider’s game. How the new conservative majority deploys its power won’t go unnoticed. If the court oversteps, as Prof. Eric Posner of the University of Chicago Law School predicted the other day, it may well achieve the current majority’s goals. But that achievement in turn can fuel a reaction that, over time, gives birth to a new majority. A long time, granted. The cycles of constitutional time, to borrow a resonant phrase from my Yale Law School colleague, Jack Balkin, run long. But as we are seeing now, they run. I can’t end this column without a mention of the poignant farewell message that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor issued this week. At age 88, she has been told that she has dementia, the disease that claimed her husband, for the sake of whose care she left the court too soon in 2006, after 25 years. A moderate conservative, schooled in electoral politics, she prized pragmatism over doctrinal purity. She was, famously, the swing justice of her time, a position that fell to Justice Kennedy after her retirement. The chambers that she kept at the court as a retired justice, scarcely occupied in recent years, will now go to him. I hope that his continued presence in the building, along with the memory of hers, might serve to remind those who work there, and who now hold the Constitution’s future in their hands, of a time when not every decision was foreordained and ideology did not always reign supreme at the Supreme Court.

2018,Plot to Smear Mueller Unravels as F.B.I. Is Asked to Investigate,"WASHINGTON — The office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has asked the F.B.I. to investigate what appears to be an effort to smear him, stemming from suspicious emails offering women money in exchange for fabricating sexual misconduct claims against him. “When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the special counsel, we immediately referred the matter to the F.B.I. for investigation,” Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel’s office, said in a statement on Tuesday. The plot appeared to be the latest, and one of the more bizarre, in a string of attempts by supporters of President Trump to discredit Mr. Mueller’s investigation as a hoax and a witch hunt. Mr. Mueller is investigating whether any Trump associates conspired with Russia’s 2016 election interference and whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry. He has secured six guilty pleas and a trial conviction in the 17 months he has overseen the investigation. As the plan to target Mr. Mueller came to light on Tuesday, it quickly unraveled as news organizations unearthed gaps and inconsistencies in the allegations. The plot first came to light through one of the emails referred to the F.B.I., sent to journalists on Oct. 17 by a woman named Lorraine Parsons who said that a man had contacted her with questions about Mr. Mueller because she had worked as a paralegal with him at a law firm in 1974. She said the man, whom she identified as Bill Christensen and said had a British accent, contacted her a second time and offered her more than $50,000 to “make accusations of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment against Robert Mueller.” To get the money, he said, she would need to sign an affidavit and promised a $10,000 bonus if she did so quickly. The man added that he was working for Jack Burkman, a Republican lawyer. Ms. Parsons said she declined the financial offer and hung up the phone. She identified herself to at least two news media outlets who received her email as Lorraine D. Parsons of Fort Myers, Fla., but The New York Times could not find her. Though she wrote in the email that Mr. Mueller was “always very polite to me, and was never inappropriate,” the law firm where Ms. Parsons said she worked alongside him — Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, known at the time as Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro — said it had no record of Ms. Parsons working there. Mr. Burkman is known for peddling right-wing conspiracy theories. He suggested that Russian hit men killed Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee aide, during the 2016 presidential campaign and that someone tried to kill him while investigating Mr. Rich’s death. Law enforcement officials told Mr. Rich’s parents he was most likely killed during a botched robbery. Mr. Burkman did not respond to a message seeking comment. “The allegations of paying a woman are false,” he wrote on Twitter. He also promised to reveal new accusations against Mr. Mueller at a news conference on Thursday. He once planned and then canceled a similar event where a woman was to accuse a congressman of sexual harassment after, he said, she decided not to go forward with it. Another suspicious email, first reported by The Atlantic, was sent on Oct. 22 to Jennifer Taub, a professor at Vermont Law School. Sent by a man who identified himself as Simon Frick, a researcher at Surefire Intelligence, he said he was interested in Ms. Taub’s encounters with Mr. Mueller and was willing to pay for the information. Ms. Taub said in an interview that she had never met Mr. Mueller. Ms. Taub said she forwarded the email to the special counsel’s office and had not yet spoken to the F.B.I. Mr. Frick also appeared to be a false identity. His LinkedIn profile features a photograph of the actor Christoph Waltz. In fact, all the people listed on LinkedIn as Surefire employees have profile photographs of other people — some famous, like Mr. Waltz or the Israeli model Bar Refaeli — as previously reported by Bellingcat, an investigative website. Surefire Intelligence appeared to be linked to Jacob Wohl, a young conservative well known in certain political corners of Twitter who has contributed to The Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site. A Surefire telephone number redirects to Mr. Wohl’s mother’s voice mail, NBC News reported. And internet domain records for Surefire’s website are also tied to Mr. Wohl. Like Mr. Burkman, Mr. Wohl did not respond to a message, but on Twitter, he denied any role in the effort. The news media, Mr. Wohl wrote, “has launched a coordinated smear campaign against me.” The Gateway Pundit posted documents earlier on Tuesday that purported to contain allegations against Mr. Mueller. But the site’s founder, Jim Hoft, took down the records, saying that the site was investigating them anew and that there were “serious allegations” against Mr. Wohl.

2018,Poem: Brewerytown,"Poem In honor of his neighborhood in North Philly, which is undergoing gentrification, Iain Haley Pollock has given a face-lift to the morning love song called the aubade. Instead of greeting the dawn while his woman sleeps, the poet gazes down on the stoop at the survivors of last night’s knock-down-drag-out quarrel. Affectionate once more, this couple’s unabashed public reconciliation — when juxtaposed with the speaker’s annoyance with “the racket” his own partner is making while grinding coffee in the kitchen — is a reminder that every relationship is a work in progress, like the gentrification come to Brewerytown.

2018,Poem: Exiliados,"Poem Romeo and Juliet in 21st-century America is no simple narrative. While Javier Zamora’s lovers may not have to contend with feuding families nor navigate the ethnic minefields of “West Side Story,” their destinies are star-crossed nevertheless. As they embark on their first date, the shadow of exile — to lose a homeland and not feel quite welcome in the new one — sweeps over them. No hands are held yet, no kisses dared; yet they dream of love, what might grow from borrowed ground. Selected by Rita Dove",The New York Times
2018,Poem: Picture of a Soul,"Poem If, as Wallace Stevens claimed, “the poet is the priest of the invisible,” Elizabeth Spires may well be its high priestess. In just 59 words and 15 lines, she evokes that most stubbornly upheld, philosophically contested aspect of human consciousness: the soul. Why should my introduction presume to explain further and risk toppling this delicately poised lyric with superfluous discourse? Read it through, slowly — once, twice — then look up and let go of the breath you didn’t realize you’d been holding. Selected by Rita Dove",The New York Times
2018,Poem: VI. Penelope’s Lament,"Poem The joy that meets the arrival of a new book by Barbara Hamby is comparable to standing before the many-chambered facade of an Advent calendar: Each page opens onto a new wonder. Unfortunately, most of the buoyant monologues in “Bird Odyssey” are too long to reprint in this column; fortunately, however, the final section of the poem “The Odyssey in Six Sonnets” satisfies space limitations while delivering on its titular boast. Bawdy and irreverent, with a technically superb mix of high and low diction: Here’s Penelope’s take on the story we thought we knew. Selected by Rita Dove",The New York Times
2018,Poland Elections Test Governing Party’s Populist Message,"WARSAW — In one of Warsaw’s most run-down neighborhoods, where glittering new towers across the Vistula River shimmer in the distance but many people live in graffiti-clad buildings largely left to crumble since World War II, the Polish rapper Piotr Szot had a message for the crowd. The city’s elite may deride supporters of the country’s governing party, Law and Justice, and its candidate for mayor of Warsaw, Patryk Jaki, as a low-class hoodlum “from the block.” Good, he said. That means Mr. Jaki is one of them. “People from the town hall keep humiliating and spitting on us,” Mr. Jaki, a 33-year-old firebrand, told the crowd recently when he took the stage later in the evening. “They don’t want us to take over the town hall, because they’re afraid of what we’ll find there.” The emotional appeal to historical grievance and the targeting of voters who feel left behind despite Poland’s booming economy are strategies that worked well for the right-wing and populist Law and Justice party when it swept to power in 2015 on the strength of the rural vote. It is hoping to use a similar strategy to make inroads in the nation’s largest urban centers and powerful provincial councils. But nearly every major city — from Krakow in the south to Gdansk in the north to Warsaw in between — is currently controlled by opposition parties. The elections on Sunday will be test for Law and Justice: Can that same far-right populism seep into the cities? Fifteen of Poland’s 16 provinces are controlled by the opposition, often through a coalition with the conservative Peasant Party. For Law and Justice, there would be no greater victory than winning the office of the powerful Warsaw mayor. There are few candidates who represent the party’s style more than Mr. Jaki, the current deputy justice minister. His chief opponent, Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, of the Civic Coalition, which bands together the largest opposition parties, worries that with 14 candidates on the ballot — most running in opposition to Law and Justice — his support will be diluted in the first round of voting. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Law and Justice, has said that his goal is to create a Fourth Republic, free of any vestiges of the Communist era, steeped in Christianity and one that serves as a bulwark against the secular values espoused by Western European leaders. Over three years in power, the government has reshaped the nation’s judicial system in ways that critics say undermines the rule of law. On Friday, Europe’s top court ordered the country’s leaders to suspend a law that cleared the way for a sweeping purge of the Supreme Court. But the government has also engaged in a brutal battle with the European Union on issues like environmental policy and migration, and has sought to reshape national memory over the recent and distant past. Most recently, Poland became the first member nation to veto the bloc’s signing off on the continent’s fundamental human rights charter, saying that while it explicitly protected gay men and lesbians, there were no similar protections for Christians and Jews. For all the sweeping changes that the party has set in motion, many of its efforts to change the culture in Poland have been stymied at the local level. That is by design. When Poland broke free from the yoke of the former Soviet Union in 1989 and began to chart its course as an independent nation, leaders were wary of a government structure that centralized power. Local governments were given broad authority to set policy. Most important, they have a great degree of autonomy to direct the spending of billions from the European Union that have helped transform the nation’s infrastructure over the past decade. While Law and Justice came to power with an emotional appeal to nationalism and nostalgia, money has proved to be its most effective tool to galvanize voters across the country. The party promised to give every woman who had a second child $140 per month, and once in power, it delivered. The booming economy has allowed the party to do it without breaking the bank. Oxfam recently ranked Poland among the top countries for fighting income inequality and child poverty. Now, Law and Justice leaders are promising more, telling pensioners that they will receive an extra $80 a month and telling parents that every child will be allocated $80 at the start of the school year. In an attempt to blend social welfare and religious conservatism, the government is also promising $1,100 to women who give birth to disabled children, hoping to discourage abortion. Jerzy Bartkowski, a sociologist at the University of Warsaw, said that Law and Justice had been the biggest beneficiary of Poland’s economic miracle. “Regardless of what they had done, people would have been better off right now,” he said. “Unemployment has decreased, and there is a budget surplus, though it’s not due to any special talents of the government.” The government has pushed its conservative agenda by restricting access to contraceptives, attempting to ban abortion, hanging crosses in Parliament, removing certain textbooks from the school curriculum and cutting funding for some independent news media. In the past three years, Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Glinski, who is also the minister of culture, has tried to censor two plays staged by theaters managed by local governments. In 2015, he urged the Polish Theater in Wroclaw to cancel its show based on the Nobel Prize-winning Austrian writer Elfriede Jelinek’s book “Death and the Maiden.” Mr. Glinski deemed the play “hard-core pornography.” But it had its premiere anyway. Critics worry that if the party gains ground in localities, it will be able to shape the cultural and ideological landscape even more. Barbara Nowacka, a left-wing leader of the Civic Coalition, said the government wanted “total control on all levels” with “no freedom of speech and thought.” “They want to decide what we watch in cinemas, theaters; what our children are taught at school,” Ms. Nowacka said in an interview. “All of this can be subject to political agenda.” While Law and Justice is the dominant force in more traditional towns and villages with a population of fewer than 50,000 people — and home to 65 percent of voters — Poland’s urban centers remain bastions of more liberal and inclusive politics. Nowhere is that more evident than in Warsaw, where tens of thousands of women have filled the streets in recent months to oppose efforts to limit reproductive rights, thousands of gay men and lesbians have marched for equality, and hundreds of thousands have protested the changes to the justice system. Mr. Jaki was the driving force behind a law that sought to make it a crime to implicate the Polish nation in the slaughter of Jews during the Holocaust. The law passed, but had to be amended after an international backlash. He once compared allowing Muslim migrants into the country to the Nazi invasion of 1939. In the days before the election, the party began running television ads suggesting that the opposition wanted to bring Muslim migrants to Poland. One clip shows a man kicking a woman down the stairs in a Berlin subway station. It turned out the man was Bulgarian, not a Muslim migrant. Still, Mr. Jaki defended the campaign, saying that he had been to the West and did not want to see things “blown up” in Warsaw. If his opponent is elected, he said, “you can’t be guaranteed that won’t happen.” Mr. Jaki has the good fortune to be running at time when the current mayor, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, is weighed down by scandal, including corruption in her office and the unlawful restitution of property in Warsaw. She is not running for re-election. Bozena Kirejczyk, 53, a brand developer who lived in America for 23 years before returning to Poland seven years ago, said Mr. Jaki’s blunt style was needed. “I witnessed the opposition trampling human dignity, trampling poor people,” she said at the rap rally. “I love my country, but it hurts to see how some people have been humiliated time and time again.” Mr. Trzaskowski said that simple sloganeering would not be enough to win over voters in Warsaw. “It’s easy to use populist rhetoric and say all migrants are rapists who will rape our women,” he said in an interview in his downtown office. “It takes 10 seconds.” But Warsaw, he said, is “one of the most tolerant, open and ambitious cities in Europe,” and he said he believed that voters would see past the rhetoric. “The future of the city is at stake,” he said. Mr. Trzaskowski expressed confidence that he would secure a runoff with Mr. Jaki but said he was not taking anything for granted. “It will be close,” he said. “There will be blood and tears and it will go to the end. But I think I will win.”",The New York Times
2018,Poland Ordered to Reverse Purge of Supreme Court,"WARSAW, Poland — The top court in Europe on Friday sided with critics who have accused Poland of undermining judicial independence, ordering the country’s leaders to suspend a law that cleared the way for a sweeping purge of the nation’s Supreme Court and demanding the reinstatement of more than two dozen judges. The stinging rebuke from the Court of Justice of the European Union was the latest salvo in an escalating confrontation over the drive by Poland’s ruling party to take control of the country’s judiciary, one of many ongoing battles between Warsaw and Brussels. Poland’s government had placed reshaping the courts at the center of its agenda and had vowed to defy any efforts by the European court to interfere. But on Friday, the government took a measured approach in responding to the ruling. In issuing an interim judgment, the court sided with the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, which argued that the changes to the judicial system in Poland represented a fundamental threat to the rule of law. Although it has yet to issue a final ruling, the court said it was stepping in now to “avoid serious and irreparable damage to the interests of the E.U.” The European Commission intervened after the Polish Parliament passed a law in April that lowered the mandatory retirement age of Supreme Court judges, a change that forced out 27 of the 72 Supreme Court judges, including the court’s president, Malgorzata Gersdorf. Despite condemnation from the commission and protests that brought tens of thousands of people to the streets, the governing Law and Justice Party pressed ahead with the purge. President Andrzej Duda named replacements for the judges, and leading members of the government said it would go ahead with the plan, no matter what the European court did. The European court “is not the court of final judgment,” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in August. Jaroslaw Gowin, deputy prime minister and minister of higher education, went even farther in an August interview with a conservative weekly, Do Rzeczy. A negative ruling by the court “would be the first step toward the destruction of the European Union,” he said, “taken not by the Polish government, but by the E.U.’s tribunal of justice.” He said Polish lawmakers would have “no other choice than to set another precedent and ignore a ruling by the European tribunal as conflicting with the Lisbon Treaty,” a 2007 agreement that was intended to reign in the European Union bureaucracy. After the court’s ruling, days before national local elections, leading members of the Polish government were more cautious in their responses. Zbigniew Ziobro, the Minister of Justice, said that Poland would follow all the laws of the union, but first needed to evaluate the decision. Marcin Matczak, a professor of constitutional law at Warsaw University, said that “Polish citizens are pro-E.U.,” so it would be risky to be critical of the bloc before Sunday’s election. “I think this is not just a legal but a political blow,” he said. Ms. Gersdorf told reporters that she was pleased by the decision but disappointed that the situation had reached this point. “I am just upset that the government of my motherland didn’t want to do the same thing earlier,” she said Adam Bodnar, Poland’s government ombudsman, called the European court ruling a “victory of civil society” that he hoped would lead to a restoration of judicial independence. “Apparently membership in the E.U., being a community based on rule of law, matters.” If Poland refuses to comply with the order, it could face sanctions, including economic penalties, although past threats of punishment by Brussels have failed to prove persuasive. The fight over the courts stretches back three years, when the Law and Justice party swept into power, partly on the strength of a promise to overhaul the courts. Since then, step by step, the party has moved to exert more political influence over the judiciary. In 2015, it took control of the Constitutional Tribunal, which is tasked with ensuring that laws do not violate the Constitution. Next, it gave authority over the country’s prosecutors to the Ministry of Justice. And before moving on to the Supreme Court, it asserted new powers to select judges. Even before the government passed the law targeting the Supreme Court, Poland became the first member nation to be threatened with losing its voting rights in the European Union under Article 7 of the bloc’s treaty, after the European Commission determined that the country had failed to uphold the core values of the union. The confrontation between Brussels and Warsaw has deepened in recent months, exposing the limited tools available to the union to curb the behavior of a wayward member state. Tomasz Grzegorz Grosse, a professor of European Studies at Warsaw University, said there is an ongoing conflict between the European treaties and national constitutions that has never been fully resolved. “The Polish Constitution does not say that the European court is superior to Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal,” he said. If they contradict each other, “we will have an open conflict.” With the Tribunal now made up of judges appointed by the governing party, that could happen soon, and no one knows what would happen next. “It has never happened,” Mr. Grosse said. “It’s a completely unknown territory.”",The New York Times
2018,Polarization Seems to Be Helping Republicans in Run-Up to Midterms,"Energized voters on the right dim prospects for big Democratic gains in red districts and states. One big question looms over the fight for control of Congress: Will strong Democratic candidates ride a blue wave to victories on Nov. 6 in the long list of Republican-leaning areas they’ve put into play? Or will partisan polarization carry Republicans to a closer than expected midterm result? The fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court seems to have contributed to polarizing the electorate, helping Republicans gain in red states and districts even as Democrats cement their strong position elsewhere. The trend might fade, but if it holds it will be an abrupt change from earlier polls and last year’s special election results, which indicated that Democrats were highly competitive in red areas. Instead, the district and state polling raises the possibility of an election more like last year’s Virginia elections or the 2010 midterm elections. Both were strong results for the party out of power — but the big numbers came mainly on home turf. A similar result this year would tend to lock the Democrats into their single biggest disadvantage: the map. The Democratic geographic disadvantage is so severe that it gives the Republicans a chance to survive a so-called wave election, like the 1994, 2006 and 2010 elections that flipped control of the House. National polls continue to show all of the conditions for a wave in place. The president’s approval rating is in the low 40s. It’s a midterm election year, when the president’s party usually takes big losses. Democrats lead on the generic ballot by eight to nine points. These indicators have remained relatively stable throughout the Justice Kavanaugh controversy, but the president’s approval rating has ticked up, most likely in the conservative areas where Republicans show newfound strength. And if Republicans can take advantage of their underlying geographic advantages, they can hold down their losses and gain seats in the Senate, even in a Democratic wave. The playing field is most favorable to Republicans in the Senate: They would be all but assured to retain control if they won just three of seven competitive seats where Donald J. Trump won by at least nine points in 2016. Recent polls, including those by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College, show Republicans ahead in at least the three they need — North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas — and there are rumblings that private polls show Democrats more vulnerable in several of the rest. The House of Representatives is also stacked against Democrats because of partisan gerrymandering and the tendency for Democrats to win by lopsided margins in urban areas — and thus “waste” votes. But the House picture is not so bleak for Democrats because Republicans are defending 25 seats that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and many more districts that Mr. Trump won narrowly. Here, polarization is taking a toll on both parties. Even the strongest Republican incumbents appear to have fallen behind in most of the relatively white and well-educated suburban districts ringing America’s major cities. In the suburbs of Washington, New York, Denver, Philadelphia and Kansas City, Mo., recently completed or continuing Times/Siena polls show Democrats well positioned to flip Republican seats, even against battle-tested Republican incumbents who won easily in 2016. Democratic prospects in these suburban areas are bolstered by the expectation of strong turnout among college-educated voters, who typically represent a larger share of the electorate in midterm elections and this year are poised to back Democrats by a wide margin. Strength by Democrats in moderate suburbs makes them favorites to retake the House, even if Republicans dodge Democratic breakthroughs in conservative and less educated areas, where there’s tentative evidence that Democrats are struggling. As in our recent Senate polls, Times/Siena House polls show Democrats struggling in rural, conservative districts like those in northern Minnesota, South Texas, southern North Carolina and western Pennsylvania. It should be emphasized that these districts are only a small sample of the dozens of conservative districts where Democrats are thought to have a realistic chance to compete. And Democrats would need to break through in only a handful of them to be very well positioned to take control. But the overall trend in both the House and Senate polling is fairly clear. The view that Democrats are overwhelming favorites to take control in the House hinges on the assumption that they will break through in a meaningful number of the conservative districts they’ve put into play. But the difference between Democratic breakthroughs or defeat could come down to just a few percentage points in many of these contests. Republicans can reasonably hope that these last few percentage points will be very challenging for Democrats in conservative districts. But Democrats can hope to muscle their way over the top with strong turnout, especially from young and nonwhite voters who so far do not appear especially enthusiastic about voting. If that changes over the final weeks, it could be decisive in a long list of closely fought contests. As a result, a wide range of possible outcomes is still realistic in the fight for the House. If Democrats recover in Trump Country, you could easily imagine a 40-plus seat gain. But if Republicans hold the line in conservative areas, they could force a district-by-district battle for control that lasts late on election night or beyond. Something similar happened to Democrats in last year’s Virginia state legislative elections. Democrats swept Republicans in well-educated areas but fell just short of taking control in recounts of several districts carried by the president. A Virginia-like outcome probably wouldn’t be enough for the Republicans to hold onto the House this November, given the number of Republican retirements. But it would keep it close. A more polarized electoral outcome would also further the trend toward polarization in Congress. It could mean an expanded Republican majority in the Senate, providing a more comfortable margin for the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, after nearly two years of closely fought votes that came down to just one or two moderate Republican senators. And a narrow Democratic House majority would have fewer relatively moderate Democrats from red districts — the sort who have often said they wouldn’t support Nancy Pelosi for speaker. It could also end the careers of moderate Republicans from competitive suburban districts, on top of the many moderate members who have already decided not to run for re-election. Of the 20 House Republicans who voted “no” on the health care bill, half have either decided not to seek re-election or are underdogs to return to Congress. The post-Kavanaugh polling effect could prove to be fleeting, especially if highly energized partisans are responding to polls in unusual numbers. But over the last few decades, American electoral results have generally moved toward greater polarization. It would not be a surprise if the midterms left the nation even more divided.",The New York Times
2018,"Police Body Camera Bursts Into Flames; New York Pulls 2,990 From Use","The New York Police Department is removing nearly 3,000 body cameras from use after one of the devices worn by a Staten Island officer exploded into flames, police officials said on Sunday. The recall of the Vievu-brand LE-5 cameras could delay the department’s plan to outfit all 23,000 patrol officers with body cameras by December, and adds another twist to the complicated history surrounding the mechanisms that have already led to at least one lawsuit over how video from police encounters can be used. The use of police body cameras has surged in recent years amid a national debate over police interactions with civilians, punctuated by fatal shootings by officers of mostly unarmed black teenagers and men. Law enforcement agencies have embraced the devices as useful tools for conducting investigations and evaluating officer conduct, while reform advocates espouse their potential to help curb abuses and increase transparency. The city’s $6.4 million contract for the Vievu cameras set off a contentious debate in 2016 after it surfaced that other police departments had raised concerns about the cameras’ quality, and the city comptroller briefly blocked the deal. But the mayor and police officials defended their choice and moved forward with the plan. Vievu introduced the LE-5 in October 2017, listing among its features a lithium-ion battery that boasts more than 12 hours of recording time. The Police Department on Sunday said it would pull 2,990 of its LE-5 cameras after the explosion “revealed a potential for the battery inside the camera to ignite.” “The cause and the scope of the defect are currently being investigated,” police officials said in a statement. The officer was wearing the body camera during a midnight shift in the 121st Precinct on the northwestern shore of Staten Island when he noticed smoke coming from the bottom of the device late Saturday night, according to the Police Department. He was not injured when the body camera exploded, the police said. Officers who had been assigned the LE-5 cameras were told to immediately remove the devices and hand them in. The police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, suspended further use and distribution of the camera model “out of an abundance of caution.” “Nothing is more important than the safety of our officers, and equipping the N.Y.P.D. with the best equipment is a paramount priority,” he said. The explosion was first reported by Spectrum News NY1 on Sunday, and a reporter posted a photo on Twitter of flames shooting from the device. The police said other camera models, including the LE-4, are not affected by the order. Officers who were issued the LE-5 cameras would continue working without body cameras, officials said. So far, the Police Department has deployed more than 15,500 Vievu body cameras to officers working in its precincts, public housing, service areas and transit districts. The LE-5 model had been used in 16 commands across the city. The Police Department said earlier this year that all uniformed patrol officers would be wearing the devices by the end of the year — a year earlier than originally planned. Twenty-six commands were scheduled to get the devices between October and December, completing the rollout. Sydney Siegmeth, the vice president of global communications for Axon, Vievu’s parent company, said the company was working with the police to investigate the issue. “We will do whatever is necessary to quickly and safely resolve this situation,” she said. Axon was formerly known as Taser. The labor union representing patrol officers declined to comment. After the Police Department released body camera footage of three shootings by officers, two of them fatal, the city’s largest labor union sued in January to keep them secret under a state civil rights law that shields officers’ disciplinary records from public disclosure. The demand for the body cameras has ballooned into a multibillion-dollar market dominated by the stun-gun giant Taser, which renamed itself after its Axon body camera in 2017. Axon bought Vievu in May, after losing contract bids to its former rival in major cities like New York, Miami and Phoenix.",The New York Times
2018,Police Seek 9 Proud Boys Supporters on Riot Charges After Brawls With Antifa,"Police commanders moved on Monday to quell a controversy over the department’s handling of brawls outside a Republican club in Manhattan, saying they were seeking nine people affiliated with the Proud Boys, a far-right group, and three additional anti-fascist protesters on riot and attempted assault charges. The police on Friday arrested three protesters after an appearance by Gavin McInnes, the founder of the Proud Boys, prompting an outcry that none of his supporters had been charged for the videotaped violence. The police released a video on Monday of one of the skirmishes and said it showed the chaos that officers confronted from a different angle than the videos that have been circulating on social media. The trouble started, the police officials said, after fans of Mr. McInnes filed out of the Metropolitan Republican Club on East 83d Street and headed down Park Avenue. A splinter group of masked protesters looped around Lexington Avenue to intercept them, the police said. [Read more on Gavin McInnes and the Proud Boys.] The opposing groups came face-to-face on East 82nd Street, yelling as they met. Surveillance video from an apartment building captured a protester hurling a plastic bottle toward the Proud Boys, who were outside the camera’s frame. A man in a red hat then appears onscreen and can be seen throwing the first punch. That fight was the first of several violent clashes that spread over several blocks on the Upper East Side. By the next day, Republican Party officials were being criticized for holding the event, while some elected officials said the violence raised questions about the Police Department’s ability to handle demonstrations. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday dispatched a State Police hate crimes unit to assist the New York Police Department and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for help. The Proud Boys have been associated with violence across the United States, including in Portland, Ore., on Saturday, and have been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights nonprofit. Mr. McInnes was barred by Twitter for violating its policy on “violent extremist groups.” The police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, speaking after a police graduation at Madison Square Garden on Monday, called the violence on Friday night “disturbing and outrageous” and vowed to make more arrests. Still, he defended officers who were criticized by public officials and on social media for failing to arrest members of the Proud Boys group who were filmed hitting protesters. “Did you see the video?” Commissioner O’Neill said. “It was two or three cops on scooters. It was a group of about 20 people. As soon as they pulled up, everybody dispersed.” Dermot F. Shea, the chief of detectives, said the police were also seeking two vandals who defaced the club’s building before dawn, hours before Mr. McInnes’s appearance. The club had also received threatening phone calls last week, leading the police to assign about 50 police officers — including teams specially trained to deal with civil unrest, five sergeants and one inspector — to the event, police officials said. Between 60 and 80 people showed up to see Mr. McInnes perform a comedic routine that included a re-enactment of the murder of a Japanese socialist with a plastic sword, according to the police and organizers. By the time it was over, a similar number of anti-fascist protesters, known as antifa, had gathered outside, some in masks. The police began escorting the attendees out of the building at 122 East 83rd Street around 8:20 p.m., steering them down Park Avenue. Three minutes later, the first brawl broke out on East 82nd Street. Terence A. Monahan, the chief of department, said it took 38 seconds for three officers to arrive on scooters. “People went in one direction and the other, so there was really no one to grab at that point,” he said. Video that circulated widely on social media captured the end of the confrontation, as members of the Proud Boys group kicked, punched and stomped two protesters on the ground. A few minutes later, another fight broke out on East 82nd Street and Lexington Avenue, where the police said officers responded to two 911 calls. Chief Shea said those victims were protesters who declined to identify themselves or to file a police report. At East 84th Street and Third Avenue, a member of the Proud Boys group told passing officers that he had been attacked and had been robbed of a backpack containing his wallet. He identified three protesters as his assailants, and they were arrested. The City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, a Democrat, called on Monday for the Police Department to release all the video it has collected depicting the night’s events. “We need to be as transparent as possible,” Mr. Johnson said. “We want everyone to know exactly what happened.”",The New York Times
2018,Police Use Fitbit Data to Charge 90-Year-Old Man in Stepdaughter’s Killing,"The last time Anthony Aiello spoke to his stepdaughter, he took homemade pizza and biscotti to her house in San Jose, Calif., for a brief visit. Mr. Aiello, 90, told investigators that she then walked him to the door and handed him two roses in gratitude. But an unnoticed observer in the house later revealed that their encounter ended in murder, a police report said. Five days afterward, Mr. Aiello’s stepdaughter, Karen Navarra, 67, was discovered by a co-worker in her house with fatal lacerations on her head and neck. She had been wearing a Fitbit fitness tracker, which investigators said showed that her heart rate had spiked significantly around 3:20 p.m. on Sept. 8, when Mr. Aiello was there. Then it recorded her heart rate slowing rapidly, and stopping at 3:28 p.m., about five minutes before Mr. Aiello left the house, the report said. Mr. Aiello was arrested last week on murder charges and booked into the Santa Clara County Jail, the San Jose Police Department said. On Thursday, he will appear in court in the Hall of Justice in San Jose, according to the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office. While originally intended to motivate people to take control of their fitness and health, fitness devices have found their way into the technology toolbox that law enforcement experts use to solve crimes, alongside videos, GPS devices and cellphones. Fastened to a person’s body, the devices have a unique front-row seat to their hosts’ lives, inadvertently documenting both mundane and perilous encounters as they record heartbeats, sleeping patterns and physical exertion. Fitbit location data factored into a sexual assault case in Pennsylvania in 2015 and a personal injury case in Canada in 2014. A Garmin Vivosmart GPS recorded a woman’s struggle with an attacker in Seattle in 2017. The same year, investigators used data from the Fitbit of a Connecticut woman to charge her husband with murder. This year, investigators in Iowa, with the help of F.B.I. experts, sifted through data from the Fitbit of Mollie Tibbetts, a 20-year-old student who was missing for about a month before her body was discovered in August. Surveillance video led them to a 24-year-old man who was charged with murder. “From doorbell security footage to Fitbit, technology engineered to solve some of life’s issues are solving serious crimes,” said Jeff Rosen, the district attorney for Santa Clara County. “We are continually inspired by law enforcement investigators who are thinking outside of the box.” In the San Jose case, the police said their investigation used a combination of video surveillance and data from Ms. Navarra’s Fitbit, an Alta HR device, which she wore on her left wrist and synchronized with a computer in her home, where she lived alone. On Sept. 13, a co-worker of Ms. Navarra’s went to the house to check on her because she had not showed up for her job at a pharmacy, the report said. The front door was unlocked, and she discovered Ms. Navarra dead, slouched in a chair at her dining room table. She had lacerations on her head and neck, and a large kitchen knife was in her right hand, the report said. Blood was spattered and uneaten pizza was strewn in the kitchen. The coroner ruled the death a homicide. Detectives then questioned Ms. Navarra’s only known next-of-kin, her 92-year-old mother, Adele Aiello, and Mr. Aiello. Mr. Aiello told the authorities he had dropped off the food for his stepdaughter and left her house within 15 minutes, but he said he saw Ms. Navarra drive by his home with a passenger in the car later that afternoon. Investigators obtained a search warrant and retrieved the Fitbit data with the help of the company’s director of brand protection, Jeff Bonham, the police report said. On Wednesday, Fitbit declined to comment on the case but shared a copy of its privacy policy, which says in part that the company complies with legal processes, including search warrants and court orders, when it shares data. When Ms. Navarra’s Fitbit data was compared with video surveillance from her home, the police report said, the police discovered that the car Mr. Aiello had driven was still there when her heart rate stopped being recorded by her Fitbit. Bloodstained clothes were later found in Mr. Aiello’s home, the document said. He was arrested on Sept. 25. Mr. Aiello was “confronted” with the Fitbit information during questioning, said Brian Meeker, a San Jose police detective. “After explaining the abilities of the Fitbit to record time, physical movement, and heart rate data, he was informed that the victim was deceased prior to his leaving the house,” Detective Meeker said in the report. Mr. Aiello said that could not be true, insisting Ms. Navarra had walked him to the door, and he suggested that someone else could have been in the home, the report said. “I explained that both systems were on internet time, and there was no deviation,” Detective Meeker said. After they finished their questions, detectives left Mr. Aiello alone in the interview room. He began talking to himself, the report said, saying repeatedly, “I’m done.”",The New York Times
2018,Political Mailer Prompts Charges of Anti-Semitism,"Days after 11 people were killed in a mass shooting inside a Pittsburgh synagogue, a new political mailer in a Connecticut legislative race is prompting accusations of anti-Semitism. The postcard, which was sent by a Republican candidate for State Senate, Ed Charamut, arrived in mailboxes on Monday and featured a cartoonish illustration of his Democratic opponent, Matt Lesser, wide-eyed and clutching $100 bills in front of an exaggerated grin. In an email to the Hartford Courant, Mr. Charamut defended the postcard, saying that he intended only to show that his opponent, who is Jewish, would be reckless with taxpayers’ money. “Those wishing to portray a graphic illustration as something hateful are completely wrong,” he wrote. “I reject hate speech in all its forms.” Efforts to reach Mr. Charamut and his campaign on Tuesday were unsuccessful. Mr. Lesser, a 35-year-old member of the state’s House of Representatives, denounced the mailer as one that plays on age-old, hurtful stereotypes of Jews. In a statement, Mr. Lesser, who is seeking a Senate seat in central Connecticut, called the tactic “astonishing, even in this environment.” Last year, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States jumped 57 percent, according to an annual report by the Anti-Defamation League. In the February report, the organization found that such incidents, including harassment, vandalism and physical assaults, climbed to 1,986 in 2017 from 1,267 the year before. The increase coincided with President Trump’s first year in office, and was the largest uptick for a single year since the organization started tracking the data in 1979. On Sunday, Mr. Lesser, who lives in Middletown, joined a candlelight vigil to show support for victims of the Pittsburgh shooting and to take a stand against hatred and anti-Semitism. His wife, Sarah, grew up four blocks from the Tree of Life synagogue, where the Saturday morning attack occurred. “Then to come home to this,” Mr. Lesser said, referring to the Republican mailer. “It’s resulted in difficult conversations about anti-Semitism with my family and my neighbors. I am comforted by support I have received from Christian pastors and lay leaders and from Republican officeholders horrified by Mr. Charamut’s poor judgment.” On Sunday night, Mr. Charamut’s campaign Facebook page posted his picture above an image of the Star of David, created from interwoven arms, above the words “Together Against Anti-Semitism.” [A prayerful Saturday morning at a Pittsburgh synagogue gave way to a fight to survive at Tree of Life.] Mr. Lesser, who will also appear on the Working Families Party line, began receiving text messages about the mailer at an event on Monday. “I assumed somebody was confused,” he said in an interview late Tuesday. “I thought it couldn’t possibly be right. But when I saw it, I was shocked. “There have been a lot of mailers in this campaign,” he added. “This is the first time that my face has been grossly distorted in a way that seems to evoke centuries of imagery used to depict the Jewish people.”",The New York Times

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with King Salman and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, above, to discuss the disappearance of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Beneath initial pleasantries, both sides were working to ease a diplomatic crisis. The U.S. seems to be leaving room for a new version of events, with President Trump suggesting that perhaps “rogue killers” had been involved. But links between Crown Prince Mohammed and at least five suspects identified by Turkey may make it harder to advance that scenario. A person familiar with Saudi plans told us that the kingdom was likely to admit that Mr. Khashoggi died at its consulate in Istanbul during an interrogation. That could put Mr. Trump in an awkward position. He doesn’t want the case to affect arms sales. And while the U.S. is far less dependent on Saudi oil than in the past, the crisis comes as we’re hearing the White House is planning sanctions against Iran, and it needs the Saudis to keep pumping oil to pull that off. _____ 2. In Missouri, the Democratic Party is having an argument with itself over how to win and what it should stand for. In 2016, Democrats lost the governorship and every statewide office but one.

Joan Barry, above, a member of the Democratic state committee, believes that the party should welcome people like her — Democrats who oppose abortion. _____ 3. Charlottesville, Va., has been confronting its Confederate past since the white supremacist march there last year. But the city has not come to terms with another part of its Jim Crow legacy: a school system that segregates students from the time they start, and steers them into separate and unequal tracks. Railroad tracks divide the city into three predominantly white elementary school zones to the north and three mostly black schools to the south. They frame one of the widest educational disparities in the United States. And since 2005, the gulf between white and black students has widened in nearly all subjects, including reading, writing, history and science. Above, two seniors at Charlottesville High School. The New York Times and ProPublica worked together on this portrait of the city’s school system. _____ 4. Congressional Democrats, optimistic about taking back the House in the midterms, are hoping to use an obscure provision in the tax code to examine President Trump’s tax returns. Above, Democratic leaders. The rule, which dates to 1920s bribery investigations during Warren Harding’s administration, allows the House Ways and Means Committee to request any filer’s tax returns from the Treasury Department. Democrats have already invoked the provision 17 times to demand the president’s tax returns, and have been blocked by the Republican majority. _____ 5.

2018,"Pope Accepts Wuerl’s Resignation as Washington Archbishop, but Calls Him a Model Bishop","VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Friday accepted the resignation of Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington, a moment many victims of clerical abuse had hoped would demonstrate his commitment to holding bishops accountable for mismanaging cases of sexual misconduct. But instead of making an example of Cardinal Wuerl, who was named in a recent Pennsylvania grand jury report that accused church leaders of covering up abuse, Francis held him up as a model for the future unity of the Roman Catholic Church. The pope cited Cardinal Wuerl’s “nobility” in volunteering to resign and announced that the 77-year-old prelate would stay on as the archdiocese’s caretaker until the appointment of a successor. In an interview, Cardinal Wuerl said that he would continue to live in Washington and that he expected to keep his position in Vatican offices that exert great influence, including one that advises the pope on the appointment of bishops. For some Catholics, Friday’s decision was a deep disappointment on an issue that has shadowed Francis’s papacy and threatened his legacy. After he became pope in 2013, Francis appointed a commission to advise him on safeguarding children from abuse, agreed to create a tribunal to try negligent bishops and spoke of “zero tolerance” for offending priests. But critics say Francis has been more talk than action. By making it clear he thought Cardinal Wuerl had served the church well, they said, Francis sent yet another mixed message on a topic that has shaken faith in the church’s leadership around the world. “It doesn’t sound like the pope has gone far enough at all,” said Mary Pat Fox, president of Voice of the Faithful, a national group that advocates for abuse victims and church accountability. “They’re removing him from this situation where people feel betrayed, but he’s still got all the power pretty much that he ever had.” It was not the first time Francis seemed to reveal a blind spot on the issue of sexual abuse. This year, he initially defended Chilean bishops against accusations that they had covered up abuse. He later listened to those who were abused, said he believed them and started removing bishops. Until just a few months ago, Cardinal Wuerl was seen as a reformer and a leader in the church’s response to sexual abuse. Then, in August, a grand jury in Pennsylvania detailed widespread clerical abuse over many decades, including accounts of Cardinal Wuerl’s poor handling of accusations against priests when he was the bishop of Pittsburgh. The report, which mentioned Cardinal Wuerl’s name more than 200 times, said he had relied on the advice of psychologists to permit priests accused of sexually abusing children to remain in the ministry. Still, the Archdiocese of Washington on Friday released a letter from Francis, saying that Cardinal Wuerl had sufficient evidence to “justify” his actions as a bishop and to “distinguish between what it means to cover up crimes or not to deal with problems, and to commit some mistakes.” “However,” Francis’s letter added, “your nobility has led you not to choose this way of defense. Of this, I am proud and thank you.” The erosion of Cardinal Wuerl’s standing was compounded by his association with his predecessor as archbishop of Washington, Theodore E. McCarrick. He recently stepped down from the College of Cardinals over accusations that he had molested an altar boy decades ago and coerced seminary students to share his bed. In an extraordinary letter released in August, the Vatican’s former ambassador to the United States, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, accused Francis of covering up inappropriate behavior by Cardinal McCarrick and called on the pope to resign. In the weeks since, Francis has alluded to Archbishop Viganò’s letter, to which he has said he will not respond, by speaking of the devil’s role in trying to divide the church. He seemed to do so again in Friday’s letter, warning against the “sterile division sown by the father of lies who, trying to hurt the shepherd, wants nothing more than that the sheep be dispersed.” Francis saw Cardinal Wuerl as that shepherd, a force for unity. The cardinal’s Sept. 21 request that the pontiff accept his resignation reflected his dedication to “procure the good of the people entrusted to your care,” Francis wrote. Cardinal Wuerl called the pope’s letter a “very, very beautiful” recognition of his effort to put his flock before himself, but added that the pope, in choosing his replacement, would select a bishop who began serving after the American church adopted new guidelines in 2002 to prevent and punish abuse. He said he was “stepping aside to allow for new leadership that doesn’t have this baggage.” Cardinal Wuerl had previously offered his resignation at age 75, as is customary in the church, but he was allowed to stay on in Washington, where he had served since 2006. In accepting his resignation now, Francis asked that Cardinal Wuerl remain as the apostolic administrator of the archdiocese. Cardinal Wuerl, who is considered a moderate and a supporter of Francis’s style of papacy, spoke in the interview about the constructive role he hoped to play at the annual meeting of American bishops in November. “We are going to each be asked to speak our mind on what we think needs to be done,” he said. And as a member of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Wuerl will still shape the American church for decades to come by helping to pick its bishops. That situation — of resigning under a cloud while maintaining Vatican power and status — recalls what happened to former Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston. After resigning in disgrace as archbishop in 2002, Cardinal Law kept his position on the Congregation for Bishops for a while, then lived out his years in Rome, where he was warmly welcomed at Vatican ceremonies and given an important basilica in Rome as his titular church. The allegations against Cardinal Wuerl are complicated, and they pale in comparison with the cover-up by Cardinal Law, who moved abusive priests from parish to parish, rather than dismissing them, enabling the abuse to continue. In the interview, Cardinal Wuerl bristled at the mention of Cardinal Law’s name. “I really can’t get into a comparison like that because I’m not certain at all that I can be faulted with reassigning over and over again priests who abused,” he said. Asked what message it sent that Francis had kept him in power in Washington despite public outcry for accountability, he said, “Stepping aside as archbishop is an enormous and very painful step for me.” Edward McFadden, a spokesman for Cardinal Wuerl, said that during the cardinal’s 12 years in Washington, “not a single priest of the Archdiocese of Washington has faced a credible claim, and there is not today a single priest in ministry in Washington who has faced a credible claim.” And during the cardinal’s 18 years as bishop of Pittsburgh, he said, “there were no cover-ups of claims of abuse.” Cardinal Wuerl’s simultaneous resignation and rehabilitation by the pope is likely to enrage conservative Catholics who have been using the sexual abuse scandal to try to bring down prelates close to Francis. Cardinal Wuerl was first seen as a rising star in the Catholic hierarchy decades ago, when he appeared to risk his career to report an abuse case. He arrived in Pittsburgh, a possible steppingstone to greater things, in 1988, just as the diocese had removed two priests accused of molesting altar boys. In his first months as bishop, after the priests were charged with more than 100 counts of abuse, he formed a review board at the diocese level. He also sought an extension to the statute of limitations on child sexual abuse cases in canon law. In 1993, when John Paul II was pope, Bishop Wuerl traveled to Rome, where he successfully persuaded the Vatican to overturn the reinstatement of an abusive priest. But cases from that era ultimately forced him to resign. Cardinal Wuerl initially tried to defend himself from charges in the Pennsylvania report, posting an online rebuttal on TheWuerlRecord.com that was quickly taken down after drawing criticism and ridicule. He gave an interview to a local television station, saying that the cases had occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, before the church had developed clear policies on clergy sexual abuse. “I think I did everything that I possibly could,” Cardinal Wuerl said in the television interview. But it soon became clear that he would become the biggest target of outrage over the Pennsylvania report. “The grand jury report showed that Cardinal Wuerl oversaw and participated in the cover-up,” the Pennsylvania attorney general, Josh Shapiro, said in an interview. “It is well documented.” Calls for Cardinal Wuerl to resign began almost immediately. In Washington, as the archdiocese celebrated the opening of school in late August with a special Mass, a group of teachers marked the occasion by protesting and calling for Cardinal Wuerl’s removal. At a “listening session” held at St. Matthew’s Cathedral in Washington, one parishioner after another said publicly that he should step down, said Becky Ianni, leader of the Washington-area chapter of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, who attended the session. “Wuerl to this day has not accepted his responsibility. He called what he did ‘errors in judgment,’ and that really bothered me,” she said in an interview. Cardinal Wuerl said in the interview with The Times that he would miss his role in planning the future of the archdiocese, and that in his new role as administrator, “You just keep everything in place.” “If I can take the focus off of myself, my mistakes, and focus, and help us focus on survivors, healing, the future, then that’s why I’m doing this,” he said of his resignation. “One of the needed things today is transparency and accountability. We have to get that into the regular way in which the church does business, does ministry.”",The New York Times
2018,Pope Defrocks 2 Retired Chilean Bishops Over Sexual Abuse of Minors,"ROME — Pope Francis on Saturday expelled from the priesthood two retired Chilean bishops accused of abusing minors, and made it clear they had no possibility of appeal. “The decision was adopted by the pope last Thursday, Oct. 11,” the Vatican said in a statement, “as a consequence of overt acts of abuse against minors.” The decision “does not allow for recourse,” the statement added. One of the bishops, Francisco Cox, 84, is the archbishop emeritus of the city of La Serena and is in poor health. He has a record of sexually abusing children dating to before his arrival as the bishop of the Chilean diocese of Chillan in 1974. The other is Marco Antonio Ordenes Fernandez, 53, and he has not been seen publicly for years. The pope’s sentence, the harshest available in church canon law, comes amid a sprawling sexual abuse scandal and growing doubts about whether Francis will hold bishops accountable for covering up abuse. It was handed down a day after the pope reluctantly accepted the resignation of Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, one of the most powerful men in the American church. But in that case, Francis praised Cardinal Wuerl as putting the good of the church before himself, kept him on as a caretaker until his replacement was selected and let him keep his influential Vatican offices. The accusations against Cardinal Wuerl, until recently considered one of the church’s strongest advocates for the abused, were linked to his time as the bishop of Pittsburgh and were included in a Pennsylvania grand jury report that documented widespread abuse over decades. The allegations, which Cardinal Wuerl has disputed, had to do with his suspected mismanagement of abusive priests. The Chilean bishops defrocked on Saturday were accused of sexual abuse, and their punishments were announced by the Vatican soon after the pope discussed the problem of clerical sexual abuse in Chile with President Sebastián Piñera. The two bishops had been under a cloud of suspicion for years. Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abuse survivor who has discussed his ordeal personally with Francis, said on Twitter in Spanish that their defrocking was “a wonderful day for survivors of these monsters.” Mr. Cox had been living since 2002 at the institute of the Schönstatt Fathers in Santiago, Chile, at the request of the Vatican. In a statement released on Oct. 6, Father Fernando Baeza, the institute’s provincial superior, said another allegation of abuse in 2004 in Germany was reported against Mr. Cox last year and prompted a Vatican investigation. The Vatican statement indicated that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the church office often charged with investigating church crimes, had alerted both men of their sentences through the superiors of the religious institutions where they currently reside. It added that while Mr. Cox was no longer a priest, he remained a part of the institute. The other laicized priest, Bishop Fernandez, was 42 when he became the bishop of Iquique. He retired in 2012 at age 47, citing health problems linked to hepatitis. It later emerged, however, that Bishop Fernandez, who has not been seen in public since 2013 and is believed to be living a life of penitence and prayer in Peru, was under church and civil investigations for sexual abuse. Last month, Francis defrocked Father Fernando Karadima, the 88-year-old Chilean priest whose abuse of teenage boys is central to an abuse scandal in which some of Mr. Karadima’s followers who have gone on to become powerful bishops are accused of witnessing and covering up his abuse. Francis prompted a backlash among abuse survivors and their advocates this year when he defended those bishops from what he called the “calumny” of accusations from victims of sexual abuse. Amid growing pressure, he dispatched his top sex crimes investigator to look into the situation in Chile, resulting in a damning 2,300-page report alleging malpractice and cover-ups. In the following weeks and months, Francis reversed himself and angrily suggested that he had been misled. All 34 of the country’s bishops offered their resignations en masse during an emergency meeting with the pope in May, in which they discussed the suspected cover-up. Last month, Francis accepted the sixth and seventh of those resignations.",The New York Times
2018,"Pope Francis’ Once-Soaring Popularity Has Dropped Dramatically, New Poll Says","The sexual abuse scandal has undermined Pope Francis’ once-soaring popularity in the United States, with a poll released on Tuesday showing that support for the pontiff has dropped precipitously among Americans. A new Pew poll shows that only 51 percent of Americans now rate him favorably, a fall of 19 percentage points since January 2017. Francis has retained the support of seven in 10 American Catholics, but that has dropped from about eight in 10 since January of this year, when the sexual abuse scandal re-emerged as an international crisis for the Roman Catholic Church. The survey results, which echo two other polls last month also showing steep declines, show that Francis’ reputation, which once seemed unassailable, has sustained considerable damage in the wake of the sex abuse scandal. Until recently, the pope appeared to be a rare public figure who attracted broad appeal among Americans. But since January, Francis has been forced to dismiss bishops in Chile accused of covering up abuse, and has himself been accused by a former Vatican diplomat of failing to discipline an abusive American cardinal, Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington. A shocking grand jury report in Pennsylvania released in August compounded the alarm. Now only 31 percent of American Catholics rate Francis’ handling of the church’s long-running sex abuse scandal as good or excellent, down from 54 percent in February 2014, about one year into his papacy, according to the survey, by the Pew Research Center. Francis has strongly condemned child sexual abuse and called a worldwide meeting of bishops in February to address abuse in the church. But he has refused to respond to the allegations from a Vatican diplomat, who has opposed Francis’ reformist agenda, that Francis himself was negligent in handling then-Cardinal McCarrick. His silence has left many American Catholics unsettled. “To learn that the pope has possibly had any sort of role in this is frightening,” said Lisa Bloomfield, a 34-year-old in Cincinnati who attends Mass several times a week. “It’s not the time to be silent. It’s the time to face these questions head on. It’s time to root out the evil.” Ms. Bloomfield leans conservative, politically and theologically, and has become increasingly concerned that Francis is confusing the faithful about church doctrine on marriage and sexuality. As with many conservative Catholics, the abuse scandal has proved to be a breaking point. She said of Francis, “I would say I was still dating him but hesitant, and this summer I broke up with him for sure.” The Pew survey confirms that American Catholics are polarized over Francis along political lines — a stark contrast from 2014, one year into his papacy, when Catholic Democrats and Republicans were virtually aligned in their positive opinions on him. About nine in 10 rated him favorably, no matter their political affiliations. Now Catholics who are Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party are far more likely to have a favorable opinion of Francis than Catholics who are Republicans or lean toward the Republican Party, 83 percent compared with 61 percent, the new poll shows. (The poll was conducted from Sept. 18 to 21 among 1,754 adults, including 336 Catholics. The margin of error is 2.7 percentage points for the pool of all adults, and 6.2 percent for the Catholic subgroup.) The poll results are a far cry from Francis’ first years as pope, when he won the hearts of Catholics worldwide, whatever their political leanings, with his emphasis on love, mercy and compassion for vulnerable people. He won praise for teaching by example, cradling to his chest a badly disfigured man at a public audience in St. Peter’s Square. News cameras followed as he hosted lunch for the homeless, and bent down to wash the feet of prisoners in the Holy Thursday ritual. His folksy tweets, on a range of topics from marriage to environmentalism, were retweeted eight times more frequently than those of President Barack Obama. In Italy, a celebrity gossip magazine publisher launched a weekly “My Pope” fanzine to dispense the pope’s advice and photographs. His popularity in the United States soared after he visited in 2015, when he praised Martin Luther King III in an address to Congress and embraced an immigrant girl who broke through security barriers to reach his popemobile. The first pope from Latin America, and the first from the Jesuit religious order, he seemed to bring the fresh breeze the Catholic Church needed after the shocking resignation of Pope Benedict XVI. A year after he was elected, a poll found Francis was wildly popular with American Catholics, with a broad majority saying that he represented a change for the good in the direction of the church. Some Catholic commentators anticipated a “Francis effect” that would buoy participation and membership in the church. But as Francis began to make his program clear, there was a growing backlash from conservatives. He voiced openness toward gay people, expressed good will toward Muslims, and issued a landmark teaching document that — albeit in a footnote — appeared to allow divorced and remarried Catholics who had not received a marriage annulment to take communion. The church in the United States, more than in most other countries, has become divided along ideological lines that mirror the nation’s political divide. The result is that liberal-leaning and moderate Catholics, despite their horror at the sexual abuse scandal, are far more reluctant to blame Francis himself. Dr. Tom C. Keller, an internist in Freeland, Md., grew up going to Jesuit schools, is active in his parish and sends his daughter to an all-girls Catholic school. He praised Francis for opening up the discussion in the church on subjects such as homosexuality and communion for the divorced, “even if he hasn’t really changed anything.” He said that the new revelations about the church hierarchy ignoring victims and keeping abusers in ministry was heartbreaking, especially as a parent. “They completely broke my trust. I’m almost like a beaten spouse, so to speak,” Dr. Keller said in an interview. But he said that he does not hold Francis responsible. “I think he came into this mess,” Dr. Keller said. “I think he has tried to do what he can, but I do think at this point he needs to do more. Going forward, if we don’t see some changes, then he is going to be held responsible.”",The New York Times
2018,Pope Orders New Inquiry Into Abuse Accusations Against McCarrick,"Pope Francis has ordered a deeper investigation into the accusations of sexual misconduct against Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick, the Vatican said Saturday, including a “thorough study” of archival documents to determine how he climbed the church hierarchy despite allegations he had slept with seminarians and young priests. The statement came more than a month after Carlo Maria Viganò, the former Vatican ambassador to the United States, published a remarkable letter accusing the pope of having known about, and covered up, the actions of Archbishop McCarrick. The Vatican statement did not explicitly address the accusations by Archbishop Viganò. Instead, the Vatican said, the pope’s decision was motivated generally by the “publication of the accusations” against Archbishop McCarrick, who once led the Archdiocese of Washington and was a major power in the Catholic Church in the United States. The pope, the statement said, was “aware of and concerned by the confusion that these accusations are causing in the conscience of the faithful.” Vatican officials said the statement served as recognition that mistakes were made in handling the case of Archbishop McCarrick, who resigned as Washington archbishop in 2006 after he reached the retirement age of 75. He is now 88. “The Holy See is conscious that, from the examination of the facts and of the circumstances, it may emerge that choices were taken that would not be consonant with a contemporary approach to such issues,” the statement said. “However, as Pope Francis has said: ‘We will follow the path of truth wherever it may lead.’ ” The Vatican added it would “in due course make known the conclusions of the matter regarding Archbishop McCarrick.” Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University, said that Vatican officials “know this may reflect badly on John Paul II or on Benedict” Francis’s predecessors. “They are saying, ‘We are preparing for this to be bad,’ ” Mr. Faggioli said. The flaring-up in recent months of the clerical sexual abuse scandal has threatened to engulf Francis’s papacy, as patience with him has worn thin among abuse victims and their advocates. Still, there is some resistance in the Vatican to taking concrete measures. Some bishops have said they consider abuse a problem that has been solved, a vestige from an earlier, less aware, era. Others believe it is drummed up by the secular news media, especially in the English-speaking world, to hurt the church. Francis has become more aggressive this year in speaking out against abuse, accepting the resignations of Chilean bishops he once defended against accusations of covering up abuse. And he has argued that abuse, and its cover-up, are symptoms of “clericalism” — the notion that priests are more powerful than those they are supposed to serve. On Saturday, the Vatican reiterated that it understood it needed to hold not only abusive priests accountable, but also the bishops who cover up for them. “Both abuse and its cover-up can no longer be tolerated,” the statement said, adding that “a different treatment for bishops who have committed or covered up abuse, in fact represents a form of clericalism that is no longer acceptable.” In July, Francis stripped Archbishop McCarrick of his rank of cardinal, prohibited him from exercising public ministry, and sentenced him to a life of prayer and penance. The steps came after “grave indications” were discovered in a preliminary investigation into the September 2017 accusation of a man who accused McCarrick of abuse in the 1970s, the statement said. That investigation by the United States church found credible an allegation that Archbishop McCarrick, who referred to himself as “Uncle Ted,” groped the man as a teenage altar boy. Other accusations have followed, including by men who say they were abused as young teenagers. The Vatican knew as early as 2000, during the papacy of John Paul II, about complaints from seminarians that Archbishop McCarrick was pressuring them to share his bed. John Paul had moved Archbishop McCarrick, then in Newark, to the more prominent position of archbishop of Washington, prompting a professor at a New Jersey seminary to raise concerns in a November 2000 letter to the Vatican. John Paul, who allowed abuse to fester during his papacy, made Archbishop McCarrick a cardinal the following year. In his letter, Archbishop Viganò asserted that Francis’s predecessor, Benedict XVI, who removed many abusive priests from the ministry, had punished Archbishop McCarrick. He accused Pope Francis in 2013 of ignoring or lifting the sanctions and rehabilitating the American as a political ally. There is still no evidence to support that allegation, and both Francis and Benedict have declined to comment. Questions of who knew what and when have nevertheless consumed the Vatican since the publication of Archbishop Viganò’s letter in late August, as the pope visited Ireland, where the church has been devastated by abuse. The Vatican said Saturday that it would dig into archives in the United States and the Holy See to “ascertain all the relevant facts, to place them in their historical context and to evaluate them objectively.” Marie Collins, who was appointed to Francis’ first commission on child abuse and protection, said, “I wish those Vatican archives were opened up on all abusers. If they can open it up on McCarrick, open it up for everybody.” Ms. Collins, an abuse survivor who quit the commission in frustration in 2017, added: “Survivors have been calling for that for years.”",The New York Times
2018,"Populist Wave Hits Latvia, Lifting Pro-Russia Party in Election","MOSCOW — The Baltic state of Latvia, governed since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union by political forces inclined toward Europe and wary of Russia, on Sunday became the latest country whiplashed by rising populism with the announcement of election results that showed strong support for pro-Russia and anti-establishment parties. The results delivered a serious blow to mainstream politicians and opened the way for coalition talks that, for the first time, could lead to a government that includes Harmony Center, a Moscow-friendly party that until this year had a cooperation agreement with Russia’s governing party, United Russia. Not only did Harmony win nearly 20 percent of the vote, the most in the parliamentary election held Saturday, but it was followed in second place by a new anti-establishment party. The party, KPV LV — Who Owns the State — is led by Artuss Kaimins, a flamboyant former actor turned unruly politician whose critics in Latvia deride him as “our Donald Trump.” Public discontent with Latvia’s traditional parties has been fed in recent months by a series of scandals that have left the governor of the central bank under investigation for corruption and led to the collapse of ABLV, the country’s largest locally owned bank. The United States Treasury issued a report in February describing the bank as a sprawling, money-laundering enterprise. Mr. Kaimins’s party won 14.1 percent of the vote, and another new group, the anti-corruption New Conservative Party, won 13.6 percent, meaning that Harmony could find coalition partners that would allow it to form a government. This goal has eluded the party in the past; although it has won the most in a parliamentary election before, mainstream parties have refused to include it in any deal because of its ties with Moscow. Nils Usakovs, an ethnic Russian who is mayor of Riga, the capital, and chairman of Harmony, hailed the result and said it opened the door to government for his party. “No coalition combination is possible without Harmony that would appear able and stable,” he told the news agency LETA. The alternative, Mr. Usakovs said, is “a coalition of xenophobes and gay rights supporters” that he predicted would only survive “two or three weeks.” But getting a role in government will still be an uphill struggle for Mr. Usakovs. Centrist and right-wing parties, while deeply divided by personality and rival ambitions, are generally united in their hostility toward Harmony and could patch together a coalition that would again block it from entering government. The departing prime minister, Maris Kucinskis, whose party finished sixth, warned that an alliance between populists and Harmony would be “very dangerous” because it would mean “a rather radical change of Latvia’s position toward the European Union and toward our security matters.” The Who Owns the State leader, Mr. Kaimins, who formed his party just two years ago while sitting in Parliament as an independent, has scandalized the country’s political elite. He has filmed parliamentary committee meetings and broadcast them live, denounced the European Union and fellow lawmakers as corrupt, and vowed to “personally fire” broadcasters who upset him. Harmony, a party that has traditionally drawn its support from Latvia’s large Russian-speaking minority, has worked hard of late to shed its image as a tool of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, trying to rebrand itself as a Western-style social democratic party. It has rejected calls from radical pro-Russia groups for Latvia to leave NATO and the European Union but has called for the lifting of sanctions against Moscow. Around a quarter of Latvia’s population of two million speaks Russian and gets most of its information from Russian media outlets, which regularly feature reports claiming that ethnic Latvians persecute their Russian-speaking compatriots. Recent research found that 82 percent of Russian-speaking Latvians watch Russian television channels controlled by the Kremlin.",The New York Times
2018,"Port Authority Bomber Was Trying to Commit Suicide, Defense Argues","After a Bangladeshi immigrant detonated a homemade pipe bomb last December in a crowded subway corridor near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, he admitted his role in the attack, the government said, telling investigators, “I did it for the Islamic State.” But on Tuesday, as testimony in the trial of the man, Akayed Ullah, began in Manhattan, his lawyer presented a different theory: She told the jury that her client had tried to blow himself up in a misguided suicide attempt. It had nothing to do with the Islamic State, she said, and he intended harm to no one but himself. “What this case is about is a young man — a deeply troubled, isolated young man — who wanted to take his own life,” the defense lawyer, Julia L. Gatto, said in her opening statement. In contrast, a federal prosecutor, Rebekah Donaleski, said the evidence would show that Mr. Ullah not only embraced a radical and violent ideology and studied how terrorist groups like ISIS attack Americans, but he also researched how to build a bomb and use screws as shrapnel to maim and kill civilians. “The defendant chose Monday morning rush hour for one reason,” Ms. Donaleski said. “To terrorize as many people as possible.” Mr. Ullah, 28, of Brooklyn, was the person most seriously injured in the Dec. 11 episode after the makeshift weapon strapped to his body malfunctioned. But the blast filled parts of the terminal with smoke, sent thousands of frightened commuters fleeing and disrupted rush hour as the police converged on Times Square and nearby streets. In the chaos, Mr. Ullah was subdued by Port Authority police officers and taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he waived his right to remain silent and said he had carried out the attack because of the United States government’s policies in the Middle East, prosecutors have said. The trial comes amid tension over terrorism in the United States, about a week after a Florida man mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and a few days after a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. Mr. Ullah’s case is also one of several in New York in recent years in which the authorities have said that a so-called lone wolf terrorist, inspired by foreign terrorist organizations, carried out an attack on civilians. It came just weeks after an Uzbek man, Sayfullo Saipov, was charged in a truck attack in October 2017 that killed eight people on a crowded Manhattan bike path. Ms. Donaleski told the jury that Mr. Ullah had reviewed online Islamic State propaganda videos, including one encouraging ISIS supporters who could not travel overseas to “take the fight to where you were, including here in America. The defendant did just that.” Mr. Ullah has been charged with providing material support to the Islamic State, using a weapon of mass destruction and other counts; if convicted, he could face life in prison. Ms. Donaleski meticulously described how Mr. Ullah, an electrician, built the bomb in his Brooklyn apartment, using a pipe, wires and screws he had taken from his workplace, a construction site a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. He filled a metal pipe with screws and broken Christmas tree lights and mixed an explosive powder that included ground-up match heads, she said. Then he threaded wires into the pipe and used zip ties and duct tape to attach it to his chest, Ms. Donaleski explained. He slipped a wire from the bomb into a hole in his right pants pocket and connected the wire to a 9-volt battery, she said. While riding the A train to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, he posted a message on Facebook, which read, “Oh, Trump, you failed to protect your nation,” she told the jury. In court, Mr. Ullah sat impassively at the defense table, even when prosecutors played a security video that showed the blast and him falling to the ground as commuters ducked and shielded their ears. Mr. Ullah seemed to watch more intently as the jurors passed around the jagged pipe recovered from the scene. Although no one was killed in the attack, one witness, David Wall, 65, of Hewitt, N.J., testified that he was left with shrapnel in his right leg and serious hearing problems. Mr. Wall said he was walking directly in front of Mr. Ullah. The force of the blast pushed Mr. Wall forward, and he clutched his ears. “I was dizzy,” he said. “My head was pounding.” Then he felt a pain in his right calf, “like a flame.” Almost a year later, Mr. Wall said he still had difficulty riding the subway. “Train after train goes by,” he said. “I don’t get on. And when I get on, I get off way before my stop, just to get up aboveground sometimes, just to walk. It’s tough.”",The New York Times
2018,Potential Midterm Upsets We’re Watching,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] There is nothing the political world loves more than an upset. It’s the plot twist no one saw coming. It’s the victory that upends all our expectations. It’s the shocker that tells us what we missed. Let me tell you, when it comes to upsets in 2018, our spidey senses are tingling. As we wrote yesterday, our midterms mantra is “expect surprises.” We’ve already seen a few in primary season: Wins by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts, and Mark Sanford’s defeat in South Carolina. With those shockers in mind, I tapped our political correspondents — Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin (you may know him as the Anthony Bourdain of ‘On Politics’) — to see how we could prepare ourselves for election night. Here are some of the races we’re watching for their upset potential: Steve King - House - Iowa The anti-immigration firebrand, who has aligned himself with white nationalist candidates in Europe and Canada, is being badly outspent, rejected by the local press, and abandoned by party leadership and corporate donors. It’s starting to show: A new poll released today shows him neck and neck with the Democrat J.D. Scholten, in a district President Trump won by 27 points. So could the eight-termer go down? A loss would cost Mr. Trump one of his biggest champions. Robert Menendez - Senate - New Jersey A Republican hasn’t won a U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey in nearly 50 years. But it could happen next week. Democrats have poured millions into saving the scandal-plagued Senator Robert Menendez from a defeat by the Republican pharmaceutical C.E.O. Bob Hugin. It’s a race the Democrats have to win: Given the expected losses in deep-red states like North Dakota, they can hardly afford a defeat in blue New Jersey. Kris Kobach - Governor - Kansas Democrats rejoiced when Kris Kobach, a close Trump ally and anti-immigration hard-liner, narrowly won a Republican primary in the Kansas governor’s race. Fast-forward a few months, and the Democratic nominee Laura Kelly now holds a slight edge in the three-way race. A Democratic win could be a trifecta for the party: A Great Plains governor’s mansion, veto power in the next round of redistricting and potential pickups in House races. Kristi Noem - Governor - South Dakota Exactly how Republican is South Dakota? The last Democratic governor left office in 1979. But Billie Sutton, a disabled former “rodeo man,” is making a surprisingly strong bid for governor against the four-term Republican Representative Kristi Noem. Mr. Sutton, who’s running as an anti-abortion conservative Democrat, has a compelling life story and an ex-Republican as his running mate. Either way, the outcome will be historic: Ms. Noem would be the first woman to lead the state. Safe G.O.P. House Seats - New York Metro Area Can Democrats flip Staten Island? What about Representative Pete King’s seat on Long Island? None of these scenarios feel super likely, but there’s enough Democratic energy that we wouldn’t be surprised if the Republicans lose a few longstanding districts in the New York-New Jersey metro area. The most likely candidate is New Jersey’s 11th District, where the former prosecutor Mikie Sherrill is mounting a strong bid for the seat held for decades by the Republican Rodney Frelinghuysen. [Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every evening.] ____________________ Maggie Astor, a political reporter for The Times, recently traveled to North Dakota to report on a voter ID law that might keep Native Americans away from the polls. She sent us this story, about experiencing the issue firsthand: I spent three days last week in North Dakota reporting on the voter ID law there, which requires residential addresses. Many Native Americans don’t have residential addresses, and the problem was driven home for me by what should have been a very simple task: getting to one of the reservations to report. I didn’t have enough cell service in North Dakota to use Google Maps, so I rented a GPS unit with my car. It took me to the city limits of Fort Totten, the seat of the Spirit Lake Reservation — and then it stopped. It told me I had arrived at the tribe’s administrative offices. I was actually in the middle of a remote highway, with a lake on one side and fields on the other. I had just enough service to make a call, so I pulled over and called OJ Semans, of the Native American voting rights group Four Directions, whom I was meeting at the office. He named some landmarks the GPS might be able to find, but it couldn’t find any of them. What we ended up doing was almost comical. I told OJ the lake was on my left, which told him which direction I was facing. He went to a spot where he could see the highway, and he started describing the oncoming cars. The amount of time that passed between him describing one and me seeing it told us how far away I was. I put my flashers on to identify my car, and when he finally saw it, he told me to turn. All’s well that ends well — until a few hours later, when I drove to the Turtle Mountain Reservation in Belcourt and the same thing happened again. This is the heart of the problem. Even tribal headquarters, the biggest buildings in town, don’t always have addresses. As state officials have noted, addresses can be assigned, and many have been. But the sheer scope of their absence tells you what a huge task it is. [Read Maggie’s story: In North Dakota, Native Americans Try to Turn an ID Law to Their Advantage] ____________________ As the election nears, The Times’s live polling project is talking to voters in some of the closest races. Today, Nate Cohn and the Upshot team highlighted a few polls happening right now: In California’s 25th District, north of Los Angeles, the incumbent Steve Knight led by four points in our poll, the best result we’ve had for the G.O.P. in a district rated as a tossup in quite a while. We have started polling Georgia’s Sixth — that’s the Ossoff race minus Ossoff. The Democratic candidate, Lucy McBath, has deep ties to the Black Lives Matter movement and became a gun control activist after her son was killed in a shooting. She’s receiving a cash infusion from Michael Bloomberg’s super PAC, and she may benefit from higher black turnout related to the enthusiasm over Stacey Abrams’s run for governor.

2018,Powerball Results: Winning Tickets Sold in Iowa and Harlem,"Two winning Powerball tickets were sold in Iowa and New York City and will split the nearly $688 million jackpot, lottery officials said on Sunday. The winners matched all six numbers — 8, 12, 13, 19, 27 and Powerball 4 — to claim the fourth-largest lottery prize in United States history. One ticket was purchased in central Iowa, and the other was sold at a deli on Fifth Avenue in Harlem, according to news reports. Lottery fever has been at high pitch recently, with someone in South Carolina winning the $1.54 billion Mega Millions jackpot, the second-largest lottery prize. Saturday’s total was adjusted down slightly, to $687.8 million from an estimated $750 million earlier in the week, ABC said. The cash payout for the Powerball prize would be $396.2 million, with each winner taking home $198.1 million in the split jackpot. Iowa planned to announce where the winning ticket was sold later Sunday morning. There were also $2 million winners in Texas and Florida who matched the five white balls with the added Power Play, and at least nine $1 million winners who matched all five white balls. The last Powerball winner was picked on Aug. 11, when a man from Staten Island won $245.6 million, according to The Associated Press. Powerball is played in 44 states, plus Washington, the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are one in 292.2 million, The A.P. said.",The New York Times
2018,Powerball and Mega Millions Jackpots Are Up to $2 Billion. Here’s What to Do if You Win Both.,"The Mega Millions jackpot climbed to an astounding $1.6 billion on Saturday, the largest lottery prize in United States history, just hours after a drawing failed to produce a winning ticket. The Powerball jackpot isn’t too shabby either: $470 million. Just imagine if you won both. Over $2 billion! Congratulations; you are about to hear from relatives of your ninth cousin twice removed who swear they haven’t seen the news and just want to know how you’re doing. (In the unlikely event that you haven’t yet checked, the winning numbers for the Mega Millions were 15, 23, 53, 65 and 70. The Mega ball number was 7.) [A recent lottery winner fought in court for the right to keep her name private. Read her story here.] Also: You are now the 1,650th-richest person in America! (Forget taxes for a moment; we’ll get to that later.) You knocked Herb Chambers, a self-made billionaire who turned a $500 loan from his mother into an empire of car dealerships in Massachusetts, down one spot on the Forbes World Billionaires list. You, on the other hand, facing odds of 1 in 88 quadrillion, turned several bucks’ worth of lottery tickets into $2 billion. After the winning numbers are drawn in Mega Millions and Powerball, you’ll be holding the tickets and wondering what to do. Will you take the lump sum? How about 30 years of annual payments? While you ponder that and browse islands for sale online, don’t do the following: • Announce that you won • Buy expensive things, or really anything at all, unless you can already afford it • Quit your job • Sign the winning ticket Dennis J. Siciliano has given that critical advice to jackpot winners who have hired him to help them collect their prizes. Mr. Siciliano, an estate and business lawyer in Independence, Ohio, helped the winner of a $52 million Mega Millions jackpot in August 2004, serving as the trustee of a blind trust created to keep the winner’s name private. “The bottom line is that once someone discovers that they won the lottery, the first thing they should do is secure the ticket,” Mr. Siciliano said. “Don’t tell anyone except close people.” Mr. Siciliano, who has also helped winners of much smaller jackpots of around $1 million each, said he cautions people to resist their instincts. Slow down and be methodical. After all, it may take months to receive your winnings, he said. “Proper planning upfront is really beneficial,” he said. In addition to hiring a lawyer, you should find a wealth adviser and an accountant, Mr. Siciliano said. A wealth adviser will help you avoid spending all of your money too fast, a problem for some winners, and help you invest it so it lasts for years. An accountant can reduce what you might owe in federal, state and local taxes, as well as other surprise taxes you may encounter. Before the drawing, as your mind raced about how you would spend the jackpot — maybe buy a boat, pay off student loans or move to the mountains — you might have considered sharing some with family members and friends. But it’s not that easy. Distributing some of your winnings to other people may be subject to numerous taxes, including the federal gift tax and the estate tax. To share your prize without paying additional taxes may require proof that you bought the ticket with those people, Mr. Siciliano said. “When is it truly a joint purchase or when is it one winner who is gifting over to others?” he said. “Could the I.R.S. investigate? Sure.” Those three advisers should help point out other issues that may arise. For instance, if you buy the winning ticket in one state and then decide to move, you may have both states trying to collect taxes on your prize. Another potential problem: If you signed your name on the back of the ticket, it could be difficult to remain anonymous. A New Hampshire woman who recently won $560 million signed her ticket after the drawing but then wanted to stay anonymous. She had to successfully sue to keep her name private. Over the years, many winners have avoided the limelight by accepting their prizes under the name of a trust. Mr. Siciliano created the ABC Blind Trust to collect the $52 million prize, which the winner received in a lump sum of $21.8 million after taxes. A group of Manhattan co-workers claimed a $58 million jackpot in 2015 under the name Lucky 16 Trust. In 2016, $49 million was claimed in Texas by the It Will Buy Me a Boat Revocable Trust. But in all likelihood, you won’t have these weighty issues to consider. Because you won’t win and will be back at work on Monday morning.",The New York Times
2018,Powerful Executives Have Stepped Away From the Saudis. Not SoftBank’s.,"Since the disappearance and apparent killing of a dissident journalist in a Saudi Arabian consulate, some of the most powerful figures in business are distancing themselves from the kingdom. There is one prominent exception: Masayoshi Son, chief executive of the SoftBank Group. Mr. Son, the 61-year-old founder of SoftBank, the Japanese internet, energy and financial conglomerate that owns Sprint, is one of Saudi Arabia’s biggest business partners. His company oversees the SoftBank Vision Fund, a technology investment fund that sought $100 billion in investments and received the promise of $45 billion from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. In the two years since then, the Vision Fund has become the largest private equity fund in the world, with beneficiaries that include Uber, WeWork and Slack — some of the world’s most successful start-ups. The success or failure of the joint venture has enormous ramifications for both sides. And now, an investment conference that was to be a triumphant display of the kingdom’s economic modernization has instead become a painful referendum on its human-rights record. As of Wednesday, Mr. Son had not publicly said whether he would attend the conference, known as the Future Investment Initiative, which is scheduled for next week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital. Other executives, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, have canceled plans to attend amid concerns that Saudi officials played a role in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who entered the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and never emerged. A Turkish official said Wednesday that Turkey had recordings that indicated that Mr. Khashoggi, who wrote for The Washington Post, was beaten and tortured before being beheaded and dismembered. American intelligence officials have become increasingly convinced that Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was connected in some way to Mr. Khashoggi’s death. A SoftBank spokesman, who would not allow his name to be used, said that Mr. Son would wait for more information before he made a decision about attending the conference. SoftBank’s chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, said on Tuesday that the company was “monitoring” the reports about Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance. “At this point in time, we, like most companies that have a relationship with Saudi Arabia, are watching developments and seeing where this goes,” Mr. Claure told a group of reporters at a tech industry event in San Jose, Calif. “There are developments pretty much every hour these days.” Mr. Son has pointed out to business associates that the SoftBank Vision Fund had a responsibility to the Saudi citizens who had entrusted his company with $45 billion from their kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, according to SoftBank officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. At the same time, these officials said, he has conveyed to executives at companies in the Vision Fund’s portfolio that they should not feel obligated to follow his lead, and must do what feels right to them. It is a delicate balance for Mr. Son, who is on the one hand receiving investment capital from a conservative nation that built its vast wealth with oil and on the other hand using that very wealth to fund progressive young companies with a different set of values. Since Turkish officials accused the Saudis of ordering the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a spate of foreign chief executives including Mr. Dimon, Mr. Khosrowshahi, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group and Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock has withdrawn from the conference. All their companies have financial interests in the kingdom. Mr. Dimon’s company has an office in Riyadh with about 70 employees. Mr. Schwarzman’s firm started an infrastructure fund backed by as much as $20 billion from Saudi Arabia. Mr. Fink’s company manages billions of dollars for Saudi Arabia’s central bank. And Mr. Khosrowshahi’s company received a $3.5 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund, in 2016. The managing director of the fund sits on Uber’s board. But those executives are not as deeply enmeshed with the Saudis as Mr. Son. Mr. Son is “certainly in an uncomfortable position,” said Colin C. Blaydon, director emeritus of the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “Everyone is sort of stepping back to wait and see how all of this plays out,” he added, “and the question for the immediate, for someone like Mr. Son, is, will there be a short-term solution around this conference that then gives some breathing room to try and figure out what comes next?” Some executives have taken more drastic efforts to distance themselves from the Saudis. Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, has halted discussions over planned Saudi investments in two Virgin space-tourism businesses. Ariel Emanuel, the chief executive of the entertainment agency Endeavor, is working to extricate his company from a $400 million investment it recently received from the Public Investment Fund, a person familiar with the situation had said. The Saudis’ partnership with the SoftBank Vision Fund in October 2016 was intended as a shining example of the country’s entrance into a cutting-edge economy. In April of that year, Prince Mohammed, the king’s son and now his heir apparent, unveiled Vision 2030, his blueprint for a more diverse, less oil-dependent kingdom. As part of that plan, he would float shares of Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Aramco, to the public, and use the proceeds of that deal to subsidize the Public Investment Fund, which had ambitious growth plans. The Aramco initial public offering, which was expected to raise at least $100 billion, was delayed in August. However, Prince Mohammed recently said it would happen by 2021. The Public Investment Fund pledged to invest up to $45 billion in the SoftBank Vision Fund over a five-year period. That promise raised the possibility of the Saudis being involved in dozens of promising portfolio companies in areas like artificial intelligence, robotics and ways to link devices over the internet. After the Saudis committed to the Vision Fund, Apple invested $1 billion. So did Oracle’s chief executive, Lawrence Ellison; the manufacturer Foxconn; and the chip maker Qualcomm. During a meeting with president-elect Donald J. Trump shortly before his inauguration, Mr. Son vowed to use Vision Fund capital to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 new jobs, winning favor with the new administration. “My goal is to become the Warren Buffett of the tech industry,” Mr. Son said shortly after the fund was set up. “We’re aiming to be the Berkshire Hathaway of tech.” The Vision Fund is structured like a private equity fund: Participants agree to an investment amount upfront, but send the money only as individual deals are signed. SoftBank has spent $27 billion of the Vision Fund’s $92 billion in capital as of June 30, according to the company. Saudi Arabia’s share of that would be roughly $12 billion. The fund has invested billions more in the months since. But the financial performance of the Vision Fund so far has been promising enough that Mr. Son has been discussing plans to raise a second Vision Fund — a plan that Saudi Arabia has said it heartily supports. In an interview with Bloomberg News this month, Prince Mohammed said that the Public Investment Fund would commit another $45 billion to the next Vision Fund. “Without the P.I.F., there will be no SoftBank vision fund,” he said. But since Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, SoftBank officials have privately contemplated how, in a worst-case scenario, they could distance themselves from Saudi Arabia. One option, according to a person involved in the decision-making, would be to not accept any more of the kingdom’s money.",The New York Times
2018,Powerful Hurricane Approaches Florida,"Hurricane Michael strengthened into a Category 4 storm on Wednesday, packing 130 mile-per-hour winds and on a path to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle as the most powerful hurricane to strike the mainland United States so far this year. Forecasters expect its lashing winds to become more powerful along the coastline on Tuesday, worsening as the storm draws closer and makes landfall on Wednesday. Governors in at least three states have declared emergencies, and the local authorities are urging people to evacuate or to fortify their homes ahead of the storm. Here are the latest developments: • As of 2 a.m. Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said the center of the storm was about 180 miles south of Panama City, Fla., and moving north at 12 m.p.h. Click on the map below to see the storm’s projected path. The storm is the worst ever to hit the Florida Panhandle. • A hurricane warning was in effect from the Alabama-Florida border to the Suwannee River in Florida. A hurricane watch was in effect from the Alabama-Florida border to the Mississippi-Alabama border. • Hurricane Michael could make landfall on Wednesday anywhere from Destin, Fla., to Apalachee Bay, the National Hurricane Center said. It was projected then to veer northeast — through Georgia and the Carolinas — before heading into the Atlantic on Thursday night. • The Florida governor’s office said that evacuation orders were in place for parts of at least 18 counties, and that more than 30 shelters had been opened. Some 2,500 members of the National Guard had been activated, and specialized search-and-rescue teams were being deployed. • Gas, generators and other emergency supplies were reported sold out in many places, The Tallahassee Democrat reported. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida pleaded with residents on Tuesday to heed evacuation orders and to prepare for a storm that he warned “could bring total devastation to parts of our state.” “Hurricane Michael is a monstrous storm, and the forecast keeps getting more dangerous,” Mr. Scott said during an appearance at the state’s emergency operations center in Tallahassee, the Florida capital. By Tuesday morning, a handful of counties had issued evacuation orders that were often targeted at visitors or people who live in mobile homes or low-lying areas. “If we need to have evacuations, local communities need to issue the orders now,” Mr. Scott said. “We cannot afford to wait.” Mr. Scott, a Republican who is on the ballot next month for a United States Senate seat, said he believed people were taking the storm “seriously.” But he also seemed to suggest that some local officials, familiar with the furies of triple-digit wind speeds and torrential rains, were perhaps not sufficiently fearful of Hurricane Michael’s perils. “I think a lot of people have been through 110-mile-an-hour winds, they’ve been through 12 inches of rain,” he said. “I think what’s different about this storm that really concerns me is the storm surge.” Weather forecasters, who have said storm surge could reach 12 feet in some areas, have issued a storm surge warning for the stretch between the border of Okaloosa and Walton Counties to the Anclote River. A storm surge watch is in effect on both sides of the warning area: from the Okaloosa and Walton county line westward to Florida’s border with Alabama, and from the Anclote to Anna Maria Island. On Tuesday, Mr. Scott offered an admonition to residents considering whether to flee, and he said that time was running short. “If you’re on the fence, don’t think about it,” he said. “Do it.” In the small inland town of Fountain, about a 30-minute drive northeast of Panama City, the parking lot of the Piggly Wiggly Xpress was jammed with trucks Tuesday afternoon. The skies were cloudy, but the air was thick and hot, extracting rivulets of sweat from a pool of people waiting in line at the ice machine. A few feet away, the gas pumps were busy with Floridians topping off as they fled away from the coast and north toward Dothan, Ala. — and what they hoped would be safety. Inside, the cashiers moved mountains of essential and nonessential hurricane goods: Bud Light, infant formula, potato chips, cupcakes. Zihesa Long and Tayrael Perryman were there, happy to find what they had come for: three extra-long loaves of Sunbeam bread. Mr. Perryman, 42, said they lived in Panama City, but had unable to find any bread on the shelves in their neighborhood. So they drove up Highway 231, checking and checking until they found this place. With bread in hand, Mr. Perryman and Ms. Long, 32, were headed back home. It was near a bayou, he said, and they feared that the waterway would overtop with the big storm surge coming. But they were still on the fence about leaving. The plan was to keep waiting and watching the news. If by Wednesday morning it still looked like it was going to slam straight into Panama City, then maybe they, too, would head to Dothan, where they have family they could bunk with for a while. As he waited to buy a 20-pound ice bag, Mike Sanville, 64, puffed on a cigarette and said that he was also going to try to ride the storm out in Fountain, in the small house he shares with two other men. He was expecting the town to get punched hard. “It’s coming right at us,” he said. “We’re dead center.” Mr. Sanville, a retired construction worker, said he worried that the roof would blow off his house as the winds picked up Tuesday night. If that happened, he said, he might ride out the rest of the storm in an outhouse he built out back. He said that it had survived a blow from a falling tree a few years ago. “I built it super strong,” he said. But would all three residents fit in an outhouse? Maybe, he said. No question it would be a tight fit. “We’re survivors,” his housemate, Paul Hassenplug, chimed in. “Yeah, we know how to eat dog if we have to,” Mr. Sanville said with a chuckle, and soon the men were roaring off down the road in their truck. The most interesting thing about Hurricane Michael, from a meteorological perspective, may be how normal it is. After deeply destructive hurricanes like Florence and last year’s Harvey, which dawdled over land and dumped disastrous amounts of rain, Michael is moving along at 12 to 15 miles per hour, “which is almost exactly average for storms,” said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. The storm formed in the Western Caribbean and moved north, which is normal for this time of year, and is hitting in October, which is well before the close of hurricane season at the end of November. Hurricane Michael has moved along a path well predicted by the computer models without surprises so far. “It’s a very well behaved storm,” he said. [Here’s our guide to how hurricanes are classified and why a change in category doesn’t tell the whole story.] The storm remains dangerous, however. Florida’s Big Bend, an area to the east of the Panhandle, is especially hazardous for storm surge, Dr. McNoldy said, since the waters there are not very deep and “the shape of the coast is such that the water has nowhere to go.” And while hurricanes are not caused by climate change, and the links between global warming and storm intensity are still being worked out, some effects of warming are becoming apparent, particularly in increased storm surge and rainfall. The National Hurricane Center on Tuesday warned of “life threatening” storm surge and hurricane winds, with the winds extending “well inland” across portions of the Florida Panhandle, southern Georgia and southeast Alabama. [Does it seem as if severe storms keep damaging the same areas, and those areas are simply built up again? Part of that is the way disaster funding works. Read about it here.] Mary Thompson arrived at a Tallahassee shelter right when it opened at noon on Tuesday, eager to claim a coveted corner spot to ride out the storm. She succeeded, though another woman kept creeping closer and closer to her space, she noted. About 25 people mingled quietly in the room, the cafeteria of Lincoln High School, which is equipped with hurricane-resistant glass. Volunteers passed out water bottles and trail mix, but no cots. Some people brought sleeping bags, while others had inflatable mattresses decked out with sheets, blankets and pillows. “We had some people that were here at 10 o’clock,” two hours before opening, said Jason Koerner, the school’s assistant principal. Ms. Thompson, 69, stayed home during Hurricane Hermine in 2016 and vowed never to do so again. “It felt like the eye went right over my bed,” she said. Her street is lined with trees, she added, “and I don’t want a tree to fall on me.” Wearing a Florida State University T-shirt, Ms. Thompson said she was prepared for a stay that will likely last more than 24 hours. Among her possessions: raisins and Halloween candy. “I went trick or treating at my own house,” she joked. Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia on Tuesday declared an emergency for 92 of his state’s 159 counties, following Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama, who issued an emergency declaration on Monday. The storm is expected to cross Georgia on Wednesday and Thursday, and then move offshore into the Atlantic on Friday morning. By the time it does, it will have swept over parts of the Carolinas that were deluged when Hurricane Florence, a Category 1 storm, struck last month. “Because of the damage caused by Hurricane Florence and the fact that there’s still some standing water in places, we have to be that much more alert about the damage that Hurricane Michael could do,” Gov. Roy Cooper said at a news conference on Tuesday morning in Raleigh, North Carolina’s capital. “We know we have to be ready, and hurricane-weary North Carolinians cannot let their guard down just because we’re fatigued with Hurricane Florence.” Mr. Trump also warned residents in areas to the north to be on alert. Election offices that are closed on Tuesday because of the hurricane will be able to accept paper voter registration applications on the day they reopen, whenever that might be, Secretary of State Ken Detzner said in a memo on Monday night. The close of voter registration had been scheduled for Tuesday, four weeks before Election Day in a state with some of the country’s marquee races, including contests for governor and a United States Senate seat. The extension will not apply in all 35 counties for which Governor Scott declared a state of emergency. Election offices in some of those counties, like Alachua, which includes Gainesville, and Hillsborough, which includes Tampa, were expected to be open for business on Tuesday morning. The deadline for online voter registration — 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday — was unchanged.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Praying for Jamal Khashoggi,"Saudi Arabia stands accused of killing him. If it did, it will be a disaster for the regime of Mohammed bin Salman. Opinion Columnist Last Nov. 7, I wrote a column about the new Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. It ended this way: “As a veteran Saudi journalist remarked to me of M.B.S.: ‘This guy saved Saudi Arabia from a slow death, but he needs to broaden his base. It is good that he is freeing the house of Saud of the influence of the clergy, but he is also not allowing any second opinion of his political and economic decisions.’” I don’t think that Saudi journalist, who was also a friend, would mind if I now identified him. His name was Jamal Khashoggi. Jamal had come to my office a few days earlier for a long talk about Saudi Arabia and M.B.S. My views on Saudi Arabia are my own, but Jamal had a big impact on them. He had been inside the government. He understood that perfect was never on the menu there; you had to work with what you had. He loved his country and wanted to see it succeed, and believed that M.B.S. could shake things up and make the needed radical reforms — but also believed that M.B.S. needed a lot of coaching, because he had a dark side and was too isolated inside a small ruling circle. As the year went on, Jamal came to believe that M.B.S.’s dark side was completely taking over. When we last spoke in August — thanks to a chance encounter at 17th and K Streets in Washington — he told me that he was getting married to a Turkish woman, and could not go back to Saudi Arabia right now and that I must ring an alarm bell about the increasingly harsh crackdowns and the arrests of critics — left, right and center — in Saudi Arabia by M.B.S. And so on Sept. 4 I wrote a column that doubled down on the view of Saudi Arabia and M.B.S. that I had been making for the past year. It said: I have little doubt that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was the only one in his family who would have initiated the vital social, religious and economic reforms that he’s dared to do all at once — and that he is also the only one in that family who’d have undertaken the bullying foreign policy initiatives, domestic power plays and excessive personal buying sprees he’s dared to do all at once. These are two halves of the same M.B.S. package, and, as I’ve argued, our job is to help curb his bad impulses and nurture his good ones. But Trump — who still doesn’t even have an ambassador in Saudi Arabia — is AWOL. I went on to explain that I never believed that democracy was on the M.B.S. agenda — he was not trying to create Denmark — but that social, economic and, most important, religious reforms were. And the latter to me was the most important, but it depended on the first two moving forward. Considering the hugely damaging role that Saudi Arabia played in the Arab Muslim world, when, post-1979, it began to aggressively spread its puritanical form of Islam — which helped seed 9/11 — the idea that the kingdom might have a leader today who was beginning to shift Saudi Sunni Islam onto a more open and inclusive path, one that would isolate radical Islamists and strengthen moderates everywhere, was a vital American interest. It had to start in Saudi Arabia, the home of Mecca and Medina. It was obvious, though, I added, that in recent months M.B.S. had undertaken a series of ill-considered steps that were hurting him, Saudi Arabia and us. I explained that M.B.S. had some hard-line advisers who were urging him to follow the “China model.’’ These advisers pointed out to him what happened when China asserted itself in the South China Sea: After it seized islands, the world complained, but when China responded by saying “get lost,’’ the world backed down. So when Canada mildly criticized a Saudi Arabian human rights abuse, M.B.S. took the China approach, went nuclear and virtually broke off relations. It was an “absurd overreaction,’’ I noted. “Saudi Arabia is not China. It needs friends. It needs to be more Dubai than Shanghai — more soft power, less bullying.’’ Whatever good will M.B.S. got for empowering women to drive beginning in June, I added, was undermined by his arrests of female driving activists on charges of being related to some anti-Saudi groups in London. “Seriously,’’ I asked, “is Saudi Arabia really threatened by women driving activists?’’ And the Saudi-United Arab Emirates war in Yemen has been so badly botched that the Saudis have been accused of possible war crimes, even though Iran and the Houthi rebels had also contributed mightily to Yemen’s destruction. The future stability of Saudi Arabia and the whole Arab Gulf depends on the reform process in Saudi succeeding, and it can’t succeed without significant investments by foreigners and Saudis to create a more vibrant and diverse private sector that can offer decent jobs to all the young Saudis, men and women, coming out of universities at home and abroad. M.B.S. is still popular with many of them, but if they can’t find jobs, the religious extremists in Saudi Arabia will find many recruits among them. But for good reasons Saudi and foreign investors have become wary. They saw over the last six months in particular, I noted, a deepening pattern by M.B.S., on the advice of hard-liners around him, to put “security’’ issues ahead of the need to attract investors and talent and ministers ready to take chances and tell him the truth. Money was flowing out of the Kingdom, not in. Each M.B.S. action, I concluded, ”may have been individually justifiable, but taken together they suggest that he’s lost the plot; he’s creating more uncertainty than respect.’’ President Trump and his team don’t understand: “The U.S. can’t just subcontract order-making in the Middle East to Israel, Russia and Saudi Arabia and write them blank checks. Their leaders actually need us to draw redlines for them, too, so they can tell their own hotheads and extremists, ‘Hey, I am with you — but the Americans won’t let me do that.’” That point about the “China model’’ was leaked to me over the summer by people close to the Saudi crown prince, who were becoming increasingly alarmed. So I was shocked — but not surprised — to pick up the paper and read that Saudi Arabia stood accused of abducting or murdering Jamal Khashoggi while he was on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get some marriage papers in order. We still need to see hard evidence that these allegations are true. I truly hope that they are not. But this smells to high heaven, and it fits a steadily worsening trend. If Jamal has been abducted or murdered by agents of the Saudi government, it will be a disaster for M.B.S. and a tragedy for Saudi Arabia and all the Arab Gulf countries. It would be an unfathomable violation of norms of human decency, worse not in numbers but in principle than even the Yemen war. What Western leader, and how many Western investors, will want to stand alongside M.B.S. if it is proved that his government abducted or murdered Jamal? (And the truth will come out.) And those of us who were ready to see both the upsides and downsides of M.B.S.’s initiatives — and sincerely wanted his reforms to succeed because the upsides, if realized, were so strategically important for the future of the whole Arab-Muslim world — will conclude that the downsides have swamped the upsides and that this Saudi regime has become a threat to Saudi Arabia’s needed transformation not an engine of it. So I am praying for Jamal. Every country needs its constructive critics. The medicine they dispense is distasteful to most leaders, but it often makes them more healthy in the end. M.B.S. should be praying for him as well. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",The New York Times
2018,Premiums for Most Popular Type of Obamacare Plan Will Drop Next Year,"WASHINGTON — Prices for the most popular type of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act will drop slightly next year in the federal marketplace, after several years of rapid increases, the Trump administration said on Thursday. Specifically, it said, the average premium for the second-lowest-cost plans offering midlevel coverage will decline next year by 1.5 percent, the first time this benchmark has declined since the federal insurance exchange made its debut in 2014. “Though the average decrease is small, it is a dramatic and very positive change from the double-digit increases experienced over the past two years,” said Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the online marketplace serving 39 states. From 2017 to 2018, the benchmark rose 37 percent, officials said, and in the prior year it rose 25 percent. Ms. Verma said the new numbers vindicated Trump administration policies that many health care experts say have destabilized insurance markets. “While some have publicly been accusing us of sabotage, the reality is that we have been working hard to do everything we can to mitigate the damage caused by Obamacare,” Ms. Verma said, adding, “Our actions have succeeded.” But those claims require some context. Insurers initially lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. President Trump and Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the law and then to undo it piece by piece. To make up for all the uncertainty, and for financial losses in their first years under the law, insurers demanded big rate increases, to bring their revenues into line with their costs. “Individual market insurers are currently so profitable that it would be hard for many companies to justify a rate increase,” said Cynthia Cox, an insurance expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. This profitability, she said, is probably attracting some insurers to the market and prompting others to return. Ms. Verma said that “Anthem, Wellmark, Molina and Cigna are returning to the markets after leaving in 2016 and 2017.” All told, Ms. Verma said, there will be 23 more insurers in the federal marketplace next year, and 29 current participants will expand into additional counties. The number of states with just a single insurer on the federal exchange will drop to four, from 10 this year, she said. The sixth annual open enrollment period starts in three weeks, on Nov. 1, and continues to Dec. 15. Consumers expecting to save money must carefully compare options. To get the benefit of the lower rates, consumers will, in many cases, need to switch to a different plan, with a different network of doctors. The benchmark premiums for midlevel “silver plans” are used to calculate the subsidies available to consumers, so when benchmark premiums go down, subsidies may also go down. Benchmark premiums for a 27-year-old in the federal marketplace will average $406 a month next year, officials said. The amount that rates will go down, or up, varies substantially by state. Tennessee has by far the largest reduction in its benchmark premium, 26.2 percent, officials said. For a 27-year-old nonsmoker, this means a monthly premium of $449, down from $608 this year. Other states with large percentage reductions in benchmark premiums, as reported by the Trump administration on Thursday, were New Hampshire, down 15.2 percent to $330 a month for a 27-year-old; New Jersey, down 14.7 percent to $289; New Mexico, down 14.3 percent to $299; and Pennsylvania, down 15.9 percent to $397. States with the largest increases in benchmark premiums next year are Delaware, up 16.1 percent to $561 a month; Hawaii, up 12.5 percent to $404; and North Dakota, up 20.2 percent to $375. Wyoming has the highest benchmark premiums, which will remain unchanged at $709 a month. About 8.7 million people signed up last fall for insurance using HealthCare.gov, the website for the federal marketplace. Ms. Verma did not announce a numerical goal for the coming enrollment period. But she said the prospect of more moderate rate increases and, in some cases, rate reductions “might attract more people.” Mr. Trump has repeatedly described the Affordable Care Act as “a disaster” and predicted that it would implode. He cut off billions of dollars in cost-sharing payments to insurers last October. And he boasted at a political rally last week that he had “mostly obliterated Obamacare.” But with opinion polls showing that the law has become more popular, the Trump administration has altered its message, saying it knows how to make the law work better. Critics of the administration said premiums would be even lower next year but for actions by the president and Congress that undermined the Affordable Care Act. Congress repealed the penalty for people who go without health insurance, and new rules issued in August encourage the sale of short-term plans that do not provide the full range of benefits required by the health law. In addition, the administration is supporting a legal challenge to the law, by Texas and 19 other states, that could upend the fragile equilibrium in insurance markets. But some actions by the Trump administration have pleased insurers and made the marketplace more attractive to them. Officials have carried out an executive order issued by Mr. Trump on his first day in office that directed them to minimize the “regulatory burdens” of the Affordable Care Act and give states “more flexibility and control.” The administration has granted waivers to seven states allowing them to set up programs that help pay the largest claims with a combination of state and federal funds. These programs — in Alaska, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin — reduce the costs borne by insurers and enable them to reduce premiums below what they would otherwise charge. Premiums generally rise with age and, in some states, can exceed $1,000 a month for people in their 50s and 60s. More than 80 percent of people who buy insurance on the exchange qualify for tax credits that reduce the cost. The Trump administration has expressed particular concern for people who must pay the full unsubsidized cost.",The New York Times
2018,Prescriptions for Millions of Opioid Pills Lead to Charges Against 5 Doctors,"It was not hard to tell when the doctor was in at the Staten Island office of Carl Anderson. Noisy crowds of people, some with visible signs of drug addiction, stood in long lines at all hours of the night, seeking prescriptions for oxycodone pills, the authorities said Thursday. Sometimes, the noise outside Dr. Anderson’s office got so loud that it prompted neighbors to call the police, and more than once ambulances were called to treat pill-seeking patients, a series of new indictments show. Several patients, including two of his employees, overdosed and died, the authorities said. Dr. Anderson, 57, was one of five doctors charged on Thursday with taking millions of dollars in return for prescribing oxycodone pills to purported patients with no legitimate medical need for them, according to the indictments and a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan. Another doctor, Dante A. Cubangbang, 50, who helped run a medical clinic in Queens, and a nurse practitioner prescribed 3.3 million pills that were paid for by Medicare and Medicaid over a three-year period — making him the highest prescriber in the state, one indictment says. “Instead of caring for their patients, these doctors were drug dealers in white coats,” said Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a news conference on Thursday. “These are people who’ve taken an oath to help their patients,” Mr. Berman said. “They should be on the first line of defense to combat this type of opioid abuse and instead they’re part of the problem.” A total of 10 defendants, including a White Plains pharmacist, were charged. They operated in Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx, as well as Long Island and Westchester, the authorities said. The other doctors were Nadem J. Sayegh, 64, a physician with offices in the Bronx and Westchester; Nkanga Nkanga, 65, a Staten Island physician; and Anthony Pietropinto, 80, a psychiatrist in Manhattan. Some of their operations were such well known sources of oxycodone prescriptions that they attracted customers from all over the northeast, said James J. Hunt, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s New York office. Mr. Hunt said Dr. Cubangbang used a money counter in his office at the end of the day to tally cash collected from patients and divide it among his employees. “Similar to how a bank robber would divvy up the money after a score,” he added. Dr. Cubangbang’s lawyer, Chris Cardillo, said, “We look forward to resolving the case.” Dr. Pietropinto, the psychiatrist who saw people at night in a rented office on Fifth Avenue, wrote thousands of prescriptions for large amounts of oxycodone in exchange for $50 to $100 in cash per visit, the complaint said. He instructed one patient who was reselling the pills not to fill the prescriptions at large chain pharmacies, like CVS or Walgreens, because pharmacists at those stores would raise questions. Over about five years, Dr. Pietropinto wrote prescriptions for at least 600,000 oxycodone 30 mg. tablets to about 200 patients, according to the complaint. It said that for one person alone, he prescribed more than 12,000 pills in that time period, an average of about seven tablets a day. “These allegations will be vigorously and zealously defended in a court of law,” said Dr. Pietropinto’s lawyer, Steven A. Metcalf II. Dr. Nkanga’s indictment says he made hundreds of thousands of dollars writing unnecessary prescriptions for oxycodone and other controlled substances, and asked one customer, “How many people are you representing today?” Doctors were also rewarded in other ways for the prescriptions, the indictments show. One person typically paid Dr. Sayegh between $1,000 and $5,000 per visit, and in other cases gave him bottles of high-end whisky, expensive dinners and an all-expense-paid trip to Puerto Rico, his indictment charges. Dr. Sayegh’s lawyer, Michael Bachner, said his client was “an outstanding physician and respected member of the community,” and “vigorously denies any wrongdoing.” “We are confident that he will be acquitted of all charges,” Mr. Bachner said. Lawyers for the other defendants either declined to comment, could not be reached for a response, or could not be immediately identified. The pharmacist, Marc Klein, received free lunches and an all-expenses-paid trip to Atlantic City for him and his wife in exchange for filling prescriptions for one individual, according to his indictment. When one person confronted Mr. Klein about his practices, he brazenly responded, “I guess you could call us licensed drug dealers” and “oxy pays the bills around here,” Mr. Berman said. The government said 30 mg. oxycodone pills are popular among street-level drug dealers, with a street value of about $30 per tablet in New York City; a single prescription for 120 pills could bring a dealer $3,600. The case is the latest in a line of prosecutions brought nationally against doctors, drug company executives and drug dealers that have highlighted the ways opioids have been aggressively marketed and have contributed to a national epidemic that killed tens of thousands of Americans last year. In March, five Manhattan doctors were indicted on charges they took bribes and kickbacks from Insys, the manufacturer of Subsys, a spray form of the highly addictive painkiller fentanyl. At the news conference, officials acknowledged each other’s agencies for their roles in the investigation But the New York Police Commissioner, James P. O’Neill, also thanked New Yorkers who had “called 911 to complain about noisy groups of pill seeking patients lingering outside one of these physician’s offices.” “That’s how we keep making our way forward,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,President Wants to Use Executive Order to End Birthright Citizenship,"President Trump said he was preparing an executive order that would nullify the long-accepted constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship in the United States, his latest attention-grabbing maneuver days before midterm congressional elections as he has sought to activate his base by vowing to clamp down on immigrants and immigration. “We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits,” Mr. Trump told Axios during an interview that was released in part on Tuesday, making a false claim. “It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. And it has to end.” In fact, at least 30 other countries, including Canada, Mexico and many others in the Western Hemisphere, grant automatic birthright citizenship, according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that supports restricting immigration and whose work Mr. Trump’s advisers often cite. But Mr. Trump’s plan met with swift pushback from some even in his own party on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is retiring, said in an interview that the president “obviously” cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order. “You obviously cannot do that,” Ryan told WVLK, a radio station in Lexington, Ky. “I’m a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution, and I think in this case, the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.” Mr. Ryan compared the idea of doing so to Barack Obama’s 2012 action to grant work permits and deportation reprieves to some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, which Republicans, including Mr. Trump, vociferously protested as a naked abuse of presidential power. Doing away with birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants was an idea Mr. Trump pitched as a presidential candidate, but there is no clear indication that he would be able to do so unilaterally, and attempting to would be certain to prompt legal challenges. The consensus among legal scholars is that he cannot, but Mr. Trump and his allies are eager to test it in the Supreme Court. “We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether the language of the 14th Amendment — ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ — applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally,” Vice President Mike Pence told Politico in an interview on Tuesday, several hours after Mr. Trump’s comments were reported. It is likewise unknown how serious Mr. Trump is about taking the action. In recent days, with the approach of the midterm balloting in which Republican control of Congress is at risk, he has sought to appeal to voters by making other dramatic claims that appear to have no chance of materializing, such as imminent action to grant a 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. To accomplish the idea he floated on Tuesday, Mr. Trump would have to find a way around the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which states, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The amendment means that any child born in the United States is considered a citizen. Amendments to the Constitution cannot be overridden by presidential action — they can be changed or undone only by overwhelming majorities in Congress or the states, with a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or through a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of state legislatures. Some conservatives have long made the argument that the 14th Amendment was meant to apply only to citizens and legal permanent residents, not immigrants who are present in the country without authorization. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post this year, Michael Anton, a former spokesman for Mr. Trump’s National Security Council, said birthright citizenship was based on a misreading of the amendment, and of an 1898 Supreme Court ruling that he argued pertained only to the children of legal residents. “The notion that simply being born within the geographical limits of the United States automatically confers U.S. citizenship is an absurdity — historically, constitutionally, philosophically and practically,” Mr. Anton wrote in July. “An executive order could specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens.” Mr. Trump told Axios that while he initially believed he needed a constitutional amendment or action by Congress to make the change, the White House Counsel’s Office has advised him otherwise. “Now they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order,” Mr. Trump said. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification of the legal grounds the president’s lawyers have given him for validating such a move. His discussion of the idea comes after the administration announced it was streaming more than 5,000 active-duty troops to the southern border, part of an election-season rash of executive action Mr. Trump has undertaken as he works to energize his anti-immigrant base. It also follows action by the Trump administration to try to discourage legal immigrants from using public benefits through a new federal rule that would deny green card status to people who use social safety net services, like food assistance and Medicaid. The proposal provoked outrage among civil rights groups, a response that Mr. Trump’s advisers have argued privately is a central objective of many of the president’s most aggressive proposals on immigration and other matters. Jess Morales Rocketto, the chairwoman of Families Belong Together, an immigrant advocacy group, called the idea “ethnic cleansing.” Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the idea illegal and offensive. “Aside from being unconstitutional, such an executive order would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears and drive further polarization across the country at a moment that calls for the promotion of unity and inclusion,” Ms. Clarke said in a statement. “The letter and spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment places those born in this country on equal footing, and an executive order that strips away citizenship would create a permanent group of second-class citizens and invite litigation.” Some Republicans also rejected Mr. Trump’s suggestion, an indication of the political risks for the party that attend the president’s bid to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment in advance of next Tuesday’s voting. “The President is wrong to end #BirthrightCitizenship,” Bob Hugin, a Republican candidate for Senate in New Jersey, said in a Twitter post. “We’re a nation of immigrants made better by the diversity of its people, especially in NJ. We need compassionate comprehensive immigration reform now.” A 1898 Supreme Court decision held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese parents residing in the United States, was a citizen because of his birth on American soil. Mr. Anton argued in The Post that because his parents were legal residents, the ruling should not be read as an affirmation of the status of children of undocumented immigrants. But immigration advocates argue that scrapping the concept of birthright citizenship would do away with a vital principle, and would be counterproductive to the stated goals of those who, like Mr. Trump, rail routinely against illegal immigration. According to a study by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group, if citizenship were denied to every child with at least one unauthorized parent, the unauthorized population in the United States would reach 24 million by 2050 — more than double what it is now. Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University School of Law professor and former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the 14th Amendment’s application to the children of undocumented immigrants was a matter of pure common sense. “Like anyone else, native-born Americans, whoever their parents are, can be charged with crimes if they disobey U.S. law,” Mr. Legomsky said. “How would this be possible if the U.S. had no jurisdiction over them?”",The New York Times
2018,Presiding Over the Harvard Admissions Trial: A Judge Who Was Rejected From Harvard,"BOSTON — Harvard casts a large shadow over the Federal District Court in Boston, and not just because the college’s admissions system is on trial in one of the courtrooms here. Day after day, Harvard graduates fill the witness box and gallery at the trial of Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College. Among those testifying on Monday was Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation who graduated from Harvard in 1985 and received a law degree there in 1989. Taking the stand later was Rakesh Khurana, the dean of Harvard College, who received two graduate degrees from Harvard in 1998. Also involved in the case are those who tried but failed to get into Harvard, like the Asian-American plaintiffs who are accusing Harvard of running an unfair selection process that favors the offspring of alumni, especially those who make big donations to the school in Cambridge, Mass. And then there is the judge who will decide the case, who it turns out has a Harvard connection of her own. Judge Allison D. Burroughs, the daughter of a Harvard graduate, sought to be a Harvard graduate herself, but did not get in. Her rejection suddenly became an issue in the trial on Monday, when someone going by the name “Veritas in Diversitas” sent a mass email to the reporters covering the trial suggesting that Judge Burroughs was biased against Harvard because the college had not accepted her. “Federal Judge Hides Her Own Painful History of Harvard Rejection,” was the title of the email. [Emerging in the federal trial over Harvard’s admissions practices: insights into how to get in.] As soon as the court opened for business Monday morning, Judge Burroughs summoned the lawyers to the front of the room for a whispered sidebar on “an email that you all had shared.” The sidebar was off the record, but there was considerable debate, along with a few chuckles. Even before the email was sent, Judge Burroughs had disclosed in pretrial proceedings that she had applied to Harvard and been rejected. She instead went to Middlebury College, from where she has said she happily graduated in 1983. Her father, Warren Burroughs, was a member of Harvard’s Class of 1945, but graduated in 1947, according to Harvard records and news reports. It was common for World War II-era students to graduate late. He went on to work in the insurance business and died in 2014. Whether Judge Burroughs’s rejection, as the email writer said, was deeply painful to her was not something she was willing to address on Monday. Under questioning from reporters about the email, both sides in the trial were quick to say that they did not want Judge Burroughs to recuse herself. She has been working on the case for four years, since it was filed in November 2014, and a recusal would be a significant disruption. (The Harvard side is represented by a lawyer from, you guessed it, Harvard. The plaintiffs’ lead lawyer, Adam Mortara, said he got into Harvard Law School, but chose the University of Chicago instead.) Besides, finding a judge who did not go to Harvard would be a tall order. It turns out that nine of the 13 judges in the Boston courthouse went to Harvard, records show, not including three judges in Springfield and Worcester or the magistrate judges. In court on Monday, Mr. Kahlenberg, who was testifying for the plaintiffs, offered his analysis of how Harvard could use socioeconomic factors rather than race to achieve the diversity it seeks, a view Harvard heartily contests. Mr. Khurana countered that Harvard would find it impossible to create a class of such excellence if it did not include race as one of many factors. “We’re not trying to mirror the socioeconomic or income distribution of the United States,” he said. “What we’re trying to do is identify talent.” Judge Burroughs, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014, has been open about her efforts to make tough decisions fairly. “I spend a lot of time thinking about how to do it right — in terms of correctly applying law to facts, but also in making sure that I treat litigants and their lawyers with respect and in trying to ensure that people, win or lose, feel like they were heard and their views fairly considered,” she said in a 2016 article in the Boston Bar Journal. In perhaps her best-known decision, Judge Burroughs halted President Trump’s travel ban for seven days in 2017, turning Boston’s Logan International Airport into a refuge for immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. In the Harvard trial, she has asked piercing questions about unconscious bias, wondering if the university’s admissions officers might be unwittingly putting Asian-Americans at a disadvantage. The writer of the email responded to a reply email on Sunday by saying that he (or she) was busy with a work deadline and could not speak. The email echoed the motto written on blue T-shirts worn by several alumni supporting Harvard during the first few days of the trial. Their shirts said “Diversitas,” a play on Harvard’s motto “Veritas,” which means truth. But they said they had nothing to do with the email. “Oh gosh, no,” said Jeannie Park, one of the Harvard graduates. “It was absolutely not our group.”",The New York Times
2018,Pret A Manger Says a 2nd Customer Died of Allergic Reaction,"Pret A Manger has acknowledged that a second customer died after an allergic reaction to food sold at the popular British sandwich chain. The revelation of the death in December comes as Pret is under scrutiny after a 15-year-old girl, who was allergic to sesame seeds, died in 2016 after eating a sandwich that did not list sesame seeds among the ingredients. On Wednesday, after an inquest on that case, Pret said it would start affixing ingredient labels to its fresh products. In the latest announcement, Pret said it believed the second customer’s death had been caused by dairy protein found in a nondairy yogurt supplied by CoYo, a maker of vegan products in Britain. The customer, who was not identified, reportedly purchased a “super-veg rainbow flatbread” in Bath, England, last year. “We believe this resulted in the tragic death of a customer from an allergic reaction,” the company said. The company provided no further details on the customer’s identity. Pret said it had stopped selling related products as soon as it became aware of the death. After testing confirmed the presence of a dairy protein in the vegan yogurt, it alerted Britain’s Food Standards Agency. Pret, which has about 530 shops in Britain and in cities and airports around the world, said it had terminated its business with CoYo U.K. and was “in the process of taking legal action.” In February, CoYo announced a “precautionary product removal” of its nondairy yogurts because traces of milk were found. It also blamed a separate, unnamed company for the contaminated yogurt. “We have terminated our relationship with this third-party supplier to ensure that this never happens again,” the company said. A representative of CoYo could not be reached for comment on Sunday. An earlier version of the headline with this article misstated part of the name of the chain restaurant where a second customer has died from an allergic reaction.

2018,Pret A Manger Starts Labeling Food With Allergens,"Pret A Manger, the British sandwich chain that has become a mainstay of office lunches with the promise of freshly prepared food, will be adding information about allergens in its food after the death of a girl who ate a sandwich containing sesame seeds, an ingredient she was allergic to. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it would start affixing ingredient labels to its packaging in November. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, a 15-year-old girl with a sesame allergy, had picked up an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette at London’s Heathrow Airport in 2016, thinking that it would be fine to eat because it carried no mention of sesame seeds. But sesame seeds were baked into the dough. During her flight, she collapsed from cardiac arrest and was dead within two hours. At an inquest last month, a British court determined that the labeling on the sandwich had been inadequate. “There was no specific allergen information on the baguette packaging or on the food display cabinet, and Natasha was reassured by that,” the coroner, Sean Cummings, said. Pret A Manger had not broken the law, he said, but had not taken allergen monitoring seriously. The company had been warned of allergic reactions to its baguettes six times before, according to the inquest. Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, the girl’s parents, said in a statement that they welcomed the company’s decision and hoped it would quickly lead to better labeling at the chain. “Pret says it has recognized there is much more it can do, we agree,” the couple said. “We will be inviting them to meet with us to outline how we think they can contribute to genuinely meaningful change.” Pret started in 1986, promoting its sandwiches and soup to people eating on the go. It now has about 530 shops in cities including New York, Chicago and Hong Kong. In May, the chain was bought by the conglomerate JAB Holdings for nearly $2 billion. The stores have labels on the shelves pointing out that some of the products include allergens and encourage customers to ask staff for more information. Under British law, Pret is not required to label food items individually because they are put together on the premises rather than off-site. Regulations covering food labeling in the United States vary by location, but Pret said it already uses full ingredient labels in some of its stores there. Still, the company conceded on Wednesday that there was more that it could do and said that it would start putting allergen warning stickers on individual products and display additional warning signs in its shops. Pret also said it would put full ingredient information online and in shops over the coming weeks and make sure that complaints regarding allergy-related incidents are dealt with within 24 hours. “I hope this sets us on course to drive change in the industry and ensure customers with allergies are as protected and informed as possible,” Clive Schlee, the chief executive, said in a statement. “Nothing is more important to Pret right now.” The British government was also supportive of the move. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement that “following the tragic death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse there is a clear need to review food labeling.” The shift toward labeling each product’s ingredients would be a complex challenge for the company, but analysts said the company had no alternative. “It’s been a long time coming, especially for a chain like Pret, which is built entirely around the idea that they’re a more trustworthy, fresh-food chain,” said Morgane Richert, a senior food service analyst at GlobalData. “They want customers to trust them more than a standard quick-service restaurant.” Consumers are pushing companies like Pret to provide more information about their food at every step along the supply chain, analysts said. Walmart plans to begin using the blockchain to track its food supplies so that it can pinpoint contamination. “It’s a wake-up call for the food service market,” said Jeffrey Young, the chief executive of Allegra Strategies, a food service consultancy. “A lot of responsibility goes to the individual human being in a food service environment, compared to a factory, and that’s tough,” Mr. Young said, but ultimately it’s a “necessity.” And other chains are likely to follow suit, Ms. Richert said. “You have tags saying a sandwich is vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free. Why wouldn’t you have a tag that says it contains sesame seeds or peanuts?”",The New York Times
2018,Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Announce She’s Pregnant,"LONDON — Another royal baby is on the way. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, are expecting a child in the spring, Kensington Palace announced on Monday. The announcement comes five months after the royal couple, riding a wave of popularity both in Britain and abroad, married at Windsor Castle near London, a union watched by millions of people on screens around the world. Prince Harry, 34, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and Ms. Markle, 37, are widely seen as likable and approachable, and she brought elements to the royal family that would have been unthinkable not so long ago: She is American, a former actress, biracial, divorced and a self-described feminist. Their union has been hailed as giving the royals a more accessible, modern and inclusive image. [Read about the chances that the baby would be an American citizen.] The couple landed in Sydney on Monday morning to start a 16-day tour through Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. Speculation about Ms. Markle’s pregnancy was first fueled by the buttoned-up outfit she wore on Friday to the wedding of Princess Eugenie, a first cousin of Prince Harry’s. She was then photographed carrying purple binders hours before the announcement, leading some to suggest that she might have been trying to disguise physical signs of a pregnancy. Prince Harry said last year that the couple intended to have a child soon. “Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future,” he told BBC News in November, after they had announced their engagement. The child would be seventh in line to the British throne, after, in order, Charles, Prince of Wales, father of Prince Harry; Harry’s older brother, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge; the three young children of William and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge; and Harry, himself. But under current rules, the new royal baby would not be titled prince or princess. According to a 1917 decree by King George V, the great-grandchildren of the sovereign would not be called princes or princesses, with one exception, the eldest male descendant in the direct male line — in other words, Prince William’s first child, Prince George. Queen Elizabeth revised that rule in 2012, to give that title to all of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s children, so George’s siblings are Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Unless the queen makes a similar change on their behalf, any children of Prince Harry and Ms. Markle’s would be titled earl or lady. Even so, the new royal baby will be the subject of a media frenzy, judging by reactions to the wedding, and to Monday’s news. Shortly after the announcement of Ms. Markle’s pregnancy, Twitter was ablaze with excitement, much of it with a #RoyalBaby hashtag. “Meghan is pregnant this is not a drill we are going to have POC’s (Princes and Princesses of Colour) what a time to be ALIVE,” a Twitter user wrote. “So incredibly happy for Harry and Meghan! That baby will be both beautiful on the outside and inside,” added another. After the announcement of a vernal royal birth, the question “when is spring?” spiked in Google searches. The announcement also meant that Ms. Markle’s due date might coincide with Britain’s labors to leave the European Union: Brexit is scheduled for March 29. “Please let it be March 29th,” Simon McCoy, a BBC journalist wrote on Twitter. Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are in Australia in part for the Invictus Games, a sporting event for sick and injured military veterans that includes wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball. Harry founded the games in 2014, and the latest iteration starts on Saturday. The duke and duchess will also take part in dozens of other public events — 76 in all. They will visit a rural Australian town struggling with drought, go to the Sydney Opera House for a celebration of its 45th anniversary, pet a koala in a Sydney zoo and meet Indigenous Australian leaders on Fraser Island, off eastern Australia. The baby buzz could translate into even larger crowds than they had been expected to draw. A royal spokeswoman said that Doria Ragland, Ms. Markle’s mother, was “very happy about this lovely news, and she looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild.” The most recent British royal baby arrived this year, when the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince Louis. An earlier version of this article misstated the occasion of the celebration at the Sydney Opera House. It is the opera house’s 45th anniversary, not its 75th.",The New York Times
2018,Prince and President Escalate Battle Over Khashoggi Killing,"ISTANBUL — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey swept into Ankara’s wood-paneled Parliament on Tuesday to level his most direct attack yet against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, accusing his government of planning the “savage murder” and mutilation of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi. Hours later, Prince Mohammed bounded into the gilded conference hall of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh to a standing ovation from scores of oil executives, bankers and other businessmen who had risked association with scandal over the killing of Mr. Khashoggi for a chance to profit from the kingdom’s vast wealth. “More people, more money,” the crown prince told reporters, pronouncing the event a success despite the withdrawal of dozens of speakers and the pleas of many businessmen for him to spare them embarrassment by calling it off. Their competing stage shows on Tuesday were the latest salvos in an increasingly high-stakes battle that no longer appears to leave either one room for retreat, pitting against each other two American allies who have each aspired to be the leader of their region. In Washington, President Trump made his strongest criticism yet of his Saudi ally. He pronounced the latest official Saudi account of Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance — that he was strangled to death by accident during an attempt to persuade him to come home — “the worst cover-up ever.” He had deemed it “credible” just a few days before. In its first punitive response in the three weeks since the disappearance, the administration also said it would revoke the visas of 21 Saudis suspected of killing Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist. Mr. Erdogan, with his speech on Tuesday, has now committed himself to exploiting the international uproar over the killing to inflict as much damage as possible on the public image of the crown prince, who had marketed himself to the West as a bold reformer and pivotal ally. At the same time, Mr. Erdogan continued to hold in reserve his biggest gun: the release of an audio recording and other evidence Turkish officials claim to have of the assassination. With his own display of political muscle at the investor conference, Prince Mohammed flaunted his refusal to pull back in the face of the scandal, demonstrating that the lure of kingdom’s vast oil deposits and sovereign wealth fund could still compel executives to pay tribute despite the backlash. It hardly seemed to matter that there were empty rows of gilded chairs at the afternoon sessions. The Saudi royal court said it would announce $50 billion worth of deals from the conference, with companies from Hyundai to Halliburton. And in a pointed message to Washington, the Saudi media lavished special attention on a Russian fund manager close to President Vladimir Putin. “Saudi Arabia is a great partner for us,” the fund manager, Kirill Dmitriev, proclaimed. It was a tacit reminder to the world that, at 33 years old, the crown prince could remain among the powerful figures in the Middle East for decades no matter what evidence Turkey produces. As if to drive that home, he stopped in front of video cameras at a palace in Riyadh to express condolences over a carefully staged handshake with Mr. Khashoggi’s son, Salah. Salah Khashoggi, who has been barred from leaving the kingdom, looked pained. His father was a well-known critic of the crown prince and a growing number of current and former Western officials with experience in the kingdom have said that the crown prince almost certainly authorized the killing. His son appeared to have little choice about the handshake, which was broadcast over Saudi-owned media. The crown prince “has definitely established a climate of fear inside the kingdom, and the Khashoggi killing has only reinforced that,” said Bruce Riedel, a former American intelligence official specializing in Saudi Arabia. The investor conference took place in the same hotel that the prince used last year as a prison to detain about 200 businessmen and royals while he squeezed them to turn over billions of dollars he claimed had been obtained through unspecified corruption. But if the crown prince’s power appears unchallenged inside the kingdom, Mr. Erdogan also made clear Tuesday that he has no intention of backing off what appears to be an escalating campaign to discredit the crown prince in the eyes of much of the rest of the world. In his first public statements detailing the accusations about Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, Mr. Erdogan charged Tuesday that as soon as the diplomats in the consulate knew Mr. Khashoggi would be coming back for a document, one flew back to Riyadh, where “a road map started to be established.” Then a team of 15 Saudi agents had flown to Istanbul on Oct. 2 for an ambush. “It is clear that this savage murder did not happen instantly but was planned,” Mr. Erdogan said, directly challenging the Saudi account and demanding punishment “to the highest levels.” Other Turkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have already let out more lurid details said to come from confidential intelligence: that within minutes of Mr. Khashoggi’s arrival in the consulate the team had killed and dismembered him. Reports that the team included a top Saudi doctor specializing in autopsies who brought a bone saw to the consulate have given the crown prince, often known as M.B.S., a new nickname — Mr. Bone Saw. “The Saudis are under pressure that they can’t buy their way out of this time,” said Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official and scholar at the Wilson Center. “Neither their oil nor their money are going to be able to erase the stain, or silence the glee of their enemies, including Erdogan.” Mr. Erdogan’s speech on Tuesday seemed mainly aimed at an audience of two: King Salman, the crown prince’s aging father, and Mr. Trump. Mr. Erdogan at least twice singled out King Salman for praise and deference. “I do not doubt the sincerity of King Salman,” he said. The king is the only one in Saudi Arabia who might curb the power of the crown prince without an act of violence, and Mr. Erdogan appeared to seek to divide them. Without mentioning Prince Mohammed by name, Mr. Erdogan “distinguished between King Salman and all the other suspect people in Saudi Arabia,” said Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Mr. Erdogan and a senior official of his governing Justice and Development party. “He said he is asking for and he expects the king to address the demands for justice.” He also respectfully cited a recent phone call with Mr. Trump. “We have agreed to bring light to every aspect of this issue,” Mr. Erdogan said. Two people close to Mr. Erdogan, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss conversations with the president, said he believes persuading Mr. Trump to abandon Prince Mohammed would be a prerequisite to any attempt to constrain or remove him. Turkish officials have been feeding graphic leaks to the news media about Mr. Khashoggi’s killing in part to try to turn American public opinion and thus Mr. Trump against Prince Mohammed. Yet turning the White House against the prince appears unlikely, in part because the president’s son-in-law and Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, has invested deeply in Prince Mohammed as a pillar of the administration’s strategies to both contain Iran and secure Israel. Prince Mohammed had grinned through a photo session on Monday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and his visit appeared to convey the continued support of the White House, Mr. Trump’s subsequent comments notwithstanding. Mr. Erdogan understands this, the two people close to him said. But he has evidently calculated that the chance to weaken Prince Mohammed by tarring him with the Khashoggi killing is worth the risk of facing him as a hostile ruler of Saudi Arabia for the next 50 years.",The New York Times
2018,"Princess Eugenie Marries, and Britons Gripe About the Tax Bill","LONDON — What a difference a royal wedding makes. In May, a grandchild of the queen of England married a commoner in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle as thousands of well-wishers gathered in the town and the global news media provided breathless, wall-to-wall coverage. On Friday, five months after that wildly popular wedding — of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle — a much windier and less-celebrated royal ceremony took place at St. George’s Chapel: the marriage of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank. This time, a majority of Britons declared that they would not be tuning in, according to one opinion poll, and legions took to social media to gripe about the tax bill. The two weddings, though anchored in the same castle, had marked differences from the higher star power of the guests in May to the scaled-back media coverage of the nuptials on Friday. The union of Prince Harry, who is sixth in line to the British throne, and Ms. Markle, an American actress who is biracial, divorced and a self-described feminist, was seen as the dawn of a new era championing a more inclusive monarchy. Princess Eugenie, 28, is ninth in line to the British throne and an associate director of the Hauser and Wirth art galleries in London. She is the daughter of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; and Sarah Ferguson. Mr. Brooksbank, 32, is a brand ambassador for Casamigos tequila, which was co-founded by the actor George Clooney. “It was love at first sight,” Eugenie told the British broadcaster ITV about meeting Mr. Brooksbank while skiing. At first it appeared that love was not shared by the British public on Friday. While millions of people watched the royal wedding in May, according to the BBC, a t least 84 percent of Britons said they “probably” or “definitely” would not tune in, a government poll said this month. The BBC did not show Eugenie’s wedding in full, though ITV stepped into the void with live coverage of the entire service from St. George’s Chapel. But on Saturday, ITV said it had added roughly 2.1 million viewers during its extended morning program, according to The Associated Press, meaning that many Britons did tune in. Among the 850 guests on Friday were the models Naomi Campbell and Cara Delevingne (in a smart pantsuit and top hat); the singer Robbie Williams; the actor Demi Moore; the comedian and author Stephen Fry; and, of course, Queen Elizabeth; Prince Philip; the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge; and Harry and Ms. Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Princess Eugenie, who had surgery to correct scoliosis when she was 12, wore a dress designed by Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos that allowed her scar to show. “I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars, and I think it’s really special to stand up for that,” she told ITV before the wedding. The dean of Windsor, David Conner, led the vows. Princess Eugenie’s sister, Princess Beatrice, read an excerpt from Fitzgerald’s “Great Gatsby” that invoked a passage reminding her of her fiancé’s “rare” smile. For some, even that did not go down well. One journalist, Ned Donovan, wrote on Twitter: “I get the impression that the Princesses may not actually have read the Great Gatsby, seeing as they just read a passage about the smile of a conman about to massively defraud you.” Twitter was also rife with criticism about the cost of the affair. While the royal family paid for trappings such as the flowers, the dress and the party, significant security was required for the event because the couple decided to have a carriage procession through Windsor. That security was provided by the Thames Valley Police — and paid for with taxpayers’ money. The exact cost was not immediately released, but news reports estimated it at two million pounds, or about $2.6 million. “Princess Eugenie is getting married today,” Hasan Patel wrote on Twitter. “I hope she has a nice time knowing that millions of pounds of taxpayers money is being used for her special day while schoolchildren go hungry and rough sleepers are dying on the streets.” Others said the expense showed a tone-deafness at a time of austerity in Britain. “All the whilst there’s been a sharp increase in homelessness and food bank usage,” Shahil Parmar wrote on Twitter. “What a joke.” Almost 47,000 people signed a petition by Republic, a campaign group in favor of abolishing the British monarchy, to commit no public money to the wedding and to publish all taxpayer costs. “The Palace claims the wedding will be funded by the royal family, but royal funding blurs the lines between private income and public money,” Republic wrote in a statement. “So, whether it’s the cost of policing paid for directly by us, or costs of the wedding ceremony, paid for by the royals, the taxpayer still ends up paying.” But it wasn’t all acrimony on social media. Eugenie’s decision to show her scars drew praise. “It’s so good to see that Eugenie chose her wedding dress to reveal her scar from her scoliosis surgery,” a Twitter user named Harmony wrote. “I love the mindset that it’s a badge of honour showing what she’s been through and encouraging others to do the same and not to be ashamed of surgery scars.” The event also had moments of levity. As the ceremony approached, the royal Twitter account managed to misspell the groom’s name as “Jacksbrook.” On Friday, a page boy took a tumble. The wind destabilized colorful fascinators: Many held on for dear life as gusts whipped dresses and jackets and sent at least one hat dancing down the walkway. And the BBC briefly ran a subtitle that referred to Princess Eugenie’s “beautiful breasts” rather than her “beautiful dress” as she walked up the stairs to the chapel. The British broadcaster blamed the failure of its voice recognition system, The A.P. said. After Andrea Bocelli’s soaring rendition of “Ave Maria,” the couple were pronounced husband and wife, and the newlyweds set off for their ride through the streets of Windsor.",The New York Times
2018,Private Businesses Built Modern China. Now the Government Is Pushing Back.,"The New New World HONG KONG — The comments were couched in careful language, but the warning about China’s direction was clear. China grew to prosperity in part by embracing market forces, said Wu Jinglian, the 88-year-old dean of pro-market Chinese economists, at a forum last month. Then he turned to the top politician in the room, Liu He, China’s economic czar, and said “unharmonious voices” were now condemning private enterprise. “The phenomenon,” Mr. Wu said, “is worth noting.” Mr. Wu gave rare official voice to a growing worry among Chinese entrepreneurs, economists and even some government officials: China may be stepping back from the free-market, pro-business policies that transformed it into the world’s No. 2 economy. For 40 years, China has swung between authoritarian Communist control and a freewheeling capitalism where almost anything could happen — and some see the pendulum swinging back toward the government. State-controlled companies increasingly account for growth in industrial production and profits, areas where private businesses once led. China has stepped up regulation of online commerce, real estate and video games. Companies could face higher taxes and employee benefit costs. Some intellectuals are calling for private enterprises to be abolished entirely. Dissenters in China these days must walk a careful line. But a sense of urgency — fueled in part by China’s slowing growth and rising pressures from President Trump’s trade war — has driven a growing number of officials and economists to speak out on the government’s changing stance on private business. Private enterprises are plagued by concerns and “dissatisfaction,” said Ma Jiantang, the top party official at the Development Research Center, a high-level government think tank, at the same forum, according to a transcript. “If a trend forms and no one dares to criticize it,” wrote Hu Deping, a retired minister, “the consequences will be terrible.” The debate has gone all the way to the top. On Thursday, President Xi Jinping, the country’s leader, sought to reassure private entrepreneurs that Beijing would still support them. But he also offered a full-throated defense of the country’s big state-controlled companies, which many economists believe crowd out private businesses. “Such statements as ‘there should be no state-owned enterprises’ and ‘we should have smaller-scale state-owned enterprises’ are wrong and slanted,” Mr. Xi said during a visit to a facility owned by China National Petroleum Corporation, a major state-controlled oil company. [Discuss China’s role in the world with New York Times journalists in a new Facebook group here.] China’s leadership turned to entrepreneurs in the late 1970s, after the government had led the economy to the brink of collapse. Officials gave them special economic zones where they could open factories with fewer government rules and attract foreign investors. The experiment was an unparalleled success. When extended to the rest of the country, it created a growth machine that helped make China second only to the United States in terms of economic heft. Today, the private sector contributes nearly two-thirds of the country’s growth and nine-tenths of new jobs, according to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, an official business group. So pressures on private businesses could create serious ripples. “The private sector is experiencing great difficulties right now,” wrote Mr. Hu, the retired minister, who as the son of a former top Communist Party leader is often a voice for reform in China, in an essay posted online last Thursday. “We should try our best not to replicate the nationalization of private enterprise in the 1950s and the state capitalism.” The Chinese president, who has sought greater party control over the military, the media and civil society, is now focusing on business. The government is considering taking direct stakes in the country’s big internet companies. Regulators have stepped up existing requirements that businesses, even foreign ones, give Communist Party committees a greater role in management. Leftist scholars, bloggers and government officials are providing theoretical and practical support. In January, Zhou Xincheng, a professor of Marxism at Renmin University in Beijing, declared that private ownership should be eliminated. Last month, Wu Xiaoping, then an unknown blogger, wrote that the private sector should be ended now that it had accomplished its historic mission of achieving growth. Mr. Wu’s blog went viral. Also last month, Qiu Xiaoping, a vice minister of human resources and social security, urged “democratic management” of private enterprises, saying that they should be jointly run by business owners and their employees. Some of the government’s efforts stem from necessity. Beijing must find ways to pay for increasing ambitious social programs like universal health care. It is also trying to curb problems caused by business run amok, like pollution and poor treatment of workers, as well as years of companies dodging taxes. But entrepreneurs say the pace of change in Chinese taxes — already among the world’s highest — gives them little time to prepare. For example, next year China will step up efforts to collect social-benefit payments and shift the way they are calculated, resulting in higher costs. Stricter social security tax collections could erode China’s corporate profits by 2.5 percent, according to Lu Ting, an economist at Nomura Securities in Hong Kong. That could particularly hurt smaller companies, which tend to be privately owned and often have thin profit margins. Chinese officials have promised to cut overall taxes, but the details have been scant. Beijing’s efforts to wean the economy from its dependence on borrowing have made it harder and more expensive for many private businesses to get money. At the same time, the state-owned enterprises have little problem getting new loans. Even Li Keqiang, China’s premier, recently acknowledged what he called the “hidden line” between public and private access to bank loans. Some struggling entrepreneurs are doing what was once considered unthinkable: selling out to the state. So far this year, 46 private companies have agreed to sell shares to state-controlled firms, with more than half selling controlling stakes, according to the Shanghai Securities News, an official government newspaper. While the number is small considering the vast Chinese economy, it reverses a two-decade trend of state companies selling shares to private entrepreneurs. One was the Changchun Sinoenergy Corporation, an oil and gas company. Its controlling shareholders agreed to sell their stakes to a company run by the government of Hunan Province after a loan was called. The government has pledged to inject nearly $150 million into the company. China has also taken steps to gain greater control over its technology sector, which flourished largely free from government influence. Approvals of new video game titles have been frozen since a shift in regulation that has given the Communist Party’s propaganda department a direct role, an unusual degree of power over what had been a government process. Tencent, China’s video game giant and one of the world’s largest technology companies, has lost nearly one-third of its market value. Tencent declined to comment. The authorities have also tightened rules governing online commerce. A new law requires those who run online stores to register with the government and pay taxes. That could hit Alibaba Group, also one of the world’s largest internet companies, because it runs an online bazaar, called Taobao, where merchants big and small have opened thousands of digital stores. In a statement, Alibaba said it hoped the introduction of the new law would bring positive development to the industry. Against this backdrop, state-owned companies are having a good year. In the industrial sector, state-owned companies saw their profits grow three times as fast as those in the private sector in the first seven months of the year, according to government data. That is in part because government efforts to cut back on overcapacity and pollution have fallen largely on private factories. Private entrepreneurs are loath to speak out for fear of attracting official condemnation. But signs of distress aren’t hard to find. Last month, Chen Shouhong, the founder of an investment research firm, asked a group of executive M.B.A. students — many of whom already owned publicly listed companies — to choose between panic and anxiety to describe how they feel about the economy. An overwhelming majority chose panic, according to a transcript. Mr. Chen declined to be interviewed. Optimists point to expressions of concern from China’s top leadership as an indicator that the government will give businesses more room. Others believe the tougher environment will stay. Xiao Han, an associate law professor in Beijing, cited one of Aesop's fables, of a man trying and failing to stop a donkey from going over a cliff. “Before long,” Mr. Xiao said, “we’ll probably find a body of a China donkey under the cliff.” OpinionYasheng Huang",The New York Times
2018,Private Equity’s Broadband Rush Is Riskier Than It Looks,"Breakingviews Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Buyout groups are building broadband networks across Europe, attracted by stable, healthy returns — but the numbers get tricky if bigger operators choose to compete. The British fiber infrastructure provider CityFibre is the latest broadband company to receive backing from a big financial sponsor. On Tuesday it announced a 2.5 billion British pounds, or $3.3 billion, deal with a Goldman Sachs fund and the private equity group Antin to connect up to 5 million homes to a fiber network. Deutsche Glasfaser, owned by KKR, is doing something similar in smaller German towns. So is Macquarie Group’s TDC Group in Denmark. The returns look good if consumers choose to switch from the copper networks run by incumbent operators like BT Group. Assume that a new player like CityFibre spends £550 per home and builds half a million connections a year. Next, assume that 40 percent of households take up the service and CityFibre charges £14 per customer, while making a margin of 70 percent on its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. In six years the operator would have 3 million lines, £202 million of revenue, and £141 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The total cost of building the network would be £1.65 billion, although perhaps 60 percent of that could be funded by debt, reducing the required equity to £660 million pounds. If the operator could sell the business at an infrastructure-like multiple of 15 times its earnings, the business could be sold for £2.1 billion, and the equity would have nearly doubled to £1.1 billion. That is equivalent to an internal rate of return of around 16 percent. It sounds easy. But there are a couple of snags. Competitors may invest in the same regions, leading to a lower uptake and more mediocre returns. That’s why some funds are focusing on small towns, where they hope to build a monopoly. Incumbent operators like BT may also have an interest in preserving a national position, resulting in excess capacity. Consumers also need to play ball. Existing copper networks may be good enough for many households’ needs, which might make customers reluctant to switch. Over time that will change, as demand for data should skyrocket when everyday objects from fridges to cars are connected to the internet. But private equity may have a longer wait than expected before its investment pays off.",The New York Times
2018,"Priyanka Chopra Is a Tech Investor, Too","In one of her first acts as a start-up investor, the actor Priyanka Chopra recently toured the San Francisco home of her new portfolio company, a coding education company called Holberton School. The campus resembles a WeWork more than a school, with open-plan rows of desks, decorative neon lights and meeting rooms named after famous people. The school uses projects and group learning, instead of more traditional courses, to teach software development. “You just hang out and you’re learning,” Ms. Chopra said. “It’s amazing.” Ms. Chopra, 36, has been doing a lot of hanging out and learning in technology circles lately. In between presenting at the Emmys, sitting in the front row at New York Fashion Week, celebrating the birthday of her fiancé, Nick Jonas, in Texas, and darting to her native India to act in a movie, she has squeezed in meetings with start-up founders and lined up future investments. “Geeks are taking over the world,” Ms. Chopra said. “If they haven’t already,” she quickly added. There’s no shortage of celebrities investing in tech start-ups. So far, deals from male actors, athletes and musical artists have garnered much more attention than those from famous women. Ashton Kutcher is a regular at tech conferences; Carmelo Anthony and Nas have their own funds; Leonardo DiCaprio has been an adviser to at least three venture firms. Tyra Banks, Beyoncé and Demi Lovato have participated in start-up deals. But few women have built robust portfolios. Ms. Chopra said she did not yet know how many deals she would do or how much money she would invest, but she does plan on building a portfolio. On Wednesday she announced her second investment, in Bumble, a dating and social media app founded by Whitney Wolfe Herd, one of the most prominent start-up founders in tech. Ms. Chopra plans to help promote Bumble’s launch in India in the coming months. Ms. Chopra was introduced to tech investing by her manager, Anjula Acharia, a founder and angel investor who spent time as an entrepreneur-in-residence and partner at Trinity Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm. Ms. Acharia has worked with Ms. Chopra since 2010. Ms. Acharia was the first investor in ClassPass, a fitness booking start-up; she made a return on the company’s most recent round of funding. She has also invested in Bulletproof Coffee, Health-Ade Kombucha and The Muse. She said Jimmy Iovine, a mentor who backed her entertainment start-up, DesiHits, had taught her how to anticipate cultural trends. Ms. Acharia, who has straddled Hollywood and Silicon Valley, said that, as an Indian woman, she was a rarity in both worlds. On weekends, at the Hollywood parties she has frequented with Ms. Chopra, Ms. Acharia noticed they were often the only South Asians in attendance. Then, on weekday meetings with entrepreneurs and partners at Trinity Ventures, she was often the only woman. “I was always a minority,” she said. With their involvement in Holberton, Ms. Acharia and Ms. Chopra are making an effort to help change the tech industry’s gender disparity. After the musical performer Ne-Yo invested in Holberton and began to promote the school to his fans, applications from underrepresented minorities increased. Now, two-thirds of Holberton’s students are people of color, and 30 percent are women. Ms. Chopra plans to promote the school to her fans as well. “If one day, because of Priyanka, it became 100 percent women, I’d be cool with that,” Ms. Acharia said. Founded in 2015, Holberton teaches students to code without charge, then charges 17 percent of their paycheck for three and a half years after they graduate. All of its graduates have found jobs. Ms. Chopra’s investment is part of an $8.2 million round of funding for Holberton that closed in April. She will join the company’s board of advisers. Ms. Chopra emphasized her support for Holberton’s mission to educate people from underprivileged backgrounds. Her investments will skew heavily toward companies with an element of social impact, and companies founded by women. “I don’t want to just be one of those people who’s like, ‘Yeah, I want to be on the tech bandwagon — how are they making so much money,’” she said, surveying the Holberton work space in a cream pantsuit and snakeskin stilettos. “It’s not about that.” Ms. Chopra has worked with Unicef to advocate for children since 2006, focused mostly on developing nations. But a dinner conversation with Ms. Acharia around the time of the 2016 election turned to education in America. That led Ms. Acharia to introduce Ms. Chopra to the Holberton School’s founders. “I think Holberton was the gateway drug for Priyanka,” Ms. Acharia said. Mr. Kutcher’s venture firm, Sound Ventures, is often cited as the most successful example of a celebrity’s investing in tech start-ups. Mr. Kutcher’s investments, made while he was working alongside talent manager Guy Oseary, include several of this tech wave’s most successful start-ups, like Airbnb, Uber and Spotify, as well as hot up-and-comers like Bird and Casper. At a recent conference, Mr. Kutcher was asked to offer advice to the scores of celebrities and athletes joining the tech investing fray. He said he dedicated a lot of time to becoming a credible venture capitalist, including attending every Y Combinator demo day for the past decade. “If you want to have a job, you’ve got to do the work,” he said. “It takes time, and a ton of mistakes.” Ms. Chopra said she found Mr. Kutcher’s investment approach inspiring. “I’m extremely open to listening, learning and absolutely dedicating a part of my life to this,” she said. Ms. Acharia plans to keep presenting her with new investment ideas. “Maybe we’re the new Ashton and Guy,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Pro-Kavanaugh Women,"letter A reader responds to an Op-Ed that called white women who supported Brett Kavanaugh “gender traitors.” To the Editor: Re “White Women, Come Get Your People” (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Oct. 6): Alexis Grenell’s conviction that white women who supported Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination did so to maintain their racial privileges is laced with misogyny. Her contempt for women she accuses of acting viscerally to preserve a “blood pact” with Republican men blinds her to the possibility that politically conservative women are capable of rational, independent thought. So are liberal women who resist categorically assuming that all allegations of abuse leveled by a woman against a man are entirely accurate or true. Speaking as one of these women, I don’t believe that “being falsely accused of rape is almost as bad as being raped” (except when it leads to lynching or imprisonment), but I do believe it’s bad enough. Personally I tend to doubt that Justice Kavanaugh was falsely accused but opposed his nomination for reasons having little to do with Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation. Perhaps some women who supported Justice Kavanaugh shared my doubts but decided they were outweighed by political preferences they shared with him. Ms. Grenell will never know, since she seems unwilling to consider their views with an open mind.

2018,Profundity,"daily crossword column Joon Pahk just wants to teach the world to sign. THURSDAY PUZZLE — Joon Pahk returns after a three-year absence from the Times puzzle with a deeply philosophical, trenchant grid that will move you to tears, or at least to call your loved ones and reconnect, because life is just so, so short … Kidding! Today’s solve is pretty effervescent, really, and a refreshing pause for a Thursday. You still might want to share it with a friend. Just make sure to obey your thirst, O.K.? By the time Thursday rolls around, expect those unfamiliar names. I didn’t know NANCE or NINA, and although I remember “Beasts of the Southern Wild” I forgot ANNIE. 15A: Some slang, written down, looks wrong to me even when it’s right. It doesn’t have to be modern (copacetic is a personal example and that’s old), but the word clued here by “Yay!” enters in the grid as WOOT and looks weird. I think the origin here is old-school texting and the word might have looked more charming with a combination of o’s and zeros, wo0t, looking a bit like Bill the Cat, who might also not really be modern anymore. In related news, there’s also a YOLO sighting in this grid, appropriately clued. 20A: It would have helped if I hadn’t put Netanyahu’s nickname at 3D in as “Bebe,” wouldn’t it? I had Dave “Steeb” here and wondered why I’d never seen or remembered such a name, and only figured out my mistake when I went looking for him on xwordinfo.com. We’re talking about Dave STIEB, who shows up every five years or so. It’s October and everyone’s getting into their World Series mode (you may know, the one where your team is playing golf or whatever so you’ve got to find some other bunch you can root for while still being somewhat loyal). So take a look at this excellent slider. 53A: It feels like yachting season in the puzzles lately, although it could just be me. This ship, AMERICA, beat 14 British yachts in a race around the Isle of Wight. 9D: How southern can we get on this planet? There’s a pole you have to get to, in the ANTARCTIC. 48D: I currently have a gorgeous, glossy mass of the sweet variety of this herb — in this case, Genovese BASIL — waiting to get tortured into pesto, assuming the frost doesn’t get it first. We have a while though. The sacred variety, which also goes by the name tulsi, has medicinal value in many cultures. Mr. Pahk has clued five examples of a ubiquitous item in today’s grid, at 17A, 23A, 32A, 43A and 48A, and then shaken them up to make things a little bit harder to swallow. At 17A, the most palatable option by far for what “might pop out of a kid’s mouth” has to be BUBBLE GUM. At 48A, the punniest of the bunch, a “swinger’s club” is a BASEBALL BAT. The “heavy metal band” at 23A? I was this close to “Jethro Tulle” at first (although someone has to have done a mash-up with rock bands and fabrics by now, right?) but soon settled on the correct JUDAS PRIEST. And so on — the designer at 43A was in my distant memory, and I got 32A mainly on the crosses. The revealer at 60A was necessary for my solve, at least — I’d have never gotten that last bit without it, and that last bit was the whole trick. What’s an “ingredient in some cocktails?” — It’s a SODA MIXER. What happens when you mix the last word of each of the theme answers up? You can figure that out. I did learn today that the hidden name in 48A, Tab, is not actually short for “totally artificial beverage,” which I’d always thought to be true. Some people find it truly addictive.

2018,Progressives Grudgingly Offer Ballot Line to Gov. Cuomo After Backing Cynthia Nixon,"For many of New York’s most progressive liberals, Cynthia Nixon was an enticing alternative to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democratic moderate for much of his two terms in office. Still, it was something of a risk for the Working Families Party to endorse Ms. Nixon over the governor, who has been known to hold a grudge. That risk became clear when Mr. Cuomo trounced Ms. Nixon in the Democratic primary last month, leaving the W.F.P. with a difficult choice: Keep Ms. Nixon, the actress and education advocate, atop its ticket in November, or ask Mr. Cuomo to take the party’s line. On Wednesday night, her truest supporters seemingly conceded to the inevitable, as the Working Families Party grudgingly opted to endorse Mr. Cuomo for re-election in November. The move potentially gives Mr. Cuomo, who is seeking a third term, a valuable perch from which to receive votes in the general election against the Republican candidate, Marcus Molinaro, and could help the W.F.P. assure its own survival as a viable third party in the state. Under state law, any party that fails to get 50,000 votes in an election for governor loses its place on the ballot until the next election for governor, effectively ending its influence in elections for four years. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Cuomo — who has had a fraught relationship with the Working Families Party — would accept the ballot line, and the W.F.P. set a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday for the governor to accept the offer. Mr. Cuomo’s campaign declined to comment. Major-party candidates in New York commonly appear on as many ballot lines as possible in order to maximize their tally on Election Day. Under state law, candidates in New York are able to collect votes on multiple party lines, which are counted cumulatively. Mr. Cuomo, 60, a lifelong Democrat, is expected to appear on at least one other minor party line — that of the Independence Party — in November. Despite the move to endorse Mr. Cuomo, there was still open criticism of him and his sometimes heavy-handed tactics, with battle lines sharply drawn over political purity (as represented by Ms. Nixon) versus pragmatism (as represented by Mr. Cuomo). Ms. Nixon, the actress and education advocate, had no intention of campaigning, and indicated on Wednesday through party leaders that she did not want to remain atop its ticket in November. To many, Mr. Cuomo, who ran on the party’s line in 2014, was a more logical choice. But such a calculation came with enormous political baggage: In April, when the party rejected Mr. Cuomo in favor of Ms. Nixon, two major labor unions, both of which were financial supporters of the party, said they would leave the W.F.P., a move cheered by Mr. Cuomo. In internal discussions before Wednesday’s vote, some W.F.P. members said that Mr. Cuomo, who has backed progressive causes like increases in minimum wage, same-sex marriage and paid family leave, was an obvious choice. “Although he will not support all our issues, he will support many and will be able to accomplish more than Cynthia or any other candidate, particularly with continued pressure from the left,” said Paul Merkelson, a committee member from Long Island, in an email to other members. “We need to focus on turning the State Senate.” Indeed, even before Wednesday’s vote, party leaders had been casting their 2018 campaign as a success story, noting that a number of insurgent Democrats won their primaries, including six races against former members of the Independent Democratic Conference, the defunct group which long collaborated with Republicans in Albany’s upper chamber, and defeating a Brooklyn incumbent, Martin Dilan, who was considered too closely tied to corporate interests for some members. “W.F.P. members have a lot to be proud of already this year,” said Bill Lipton, the party’s state director. “We defeated the I.D.C. We backed seven new progressive champions who are poised to win State Senate seats. And we took a bold stand against the big-money wing of the Democratic Party. We’ve already shifted the balance of power in Albany.” Mr. Cuomo’s long and somewhat tortured history with the W.F.P., which was built by labor groups and progressive activists, included a similarly tense endorsement in 2014; he received the party’s line only after promising to unify the party and work to end the I.D.C.’s relationship with the Republicans. That did not happen until earlier this year — after Ms. Nixon announced her candidacy — something that her supporters dubbed “the Cynthia effect,” though Cuomo administration officials note that such a reconciliation was in the works for months before. “The Andrew Cuomo of 2018 would be unrecognizable to the Andrew Cuomo of 2010,” Mr. Lipton said on Wednesday night, touting the party’s success in supporting Ms. Nixon, even in defeat. New York’s complex election laws limit the ways that candidates can be removed from the ballot; in Ms. Nixon’s case, if Mr. Cuomo accepts the W.F.P. line, she will vacate the governor line and become the party’s candidate for her Assembly district. Party officials said Ms. Nixon would not campaign for that seat, which is held by a Democrat, Deborah Glick. While Mr. Cuomo was endorsed, many of those attending the meeting in Lower Manhattan said their hand had been forced by the current political climate. “Our choices are between Trump Republicans and corporate Democrats,” said Jonathan Westin, the executive director of New York Communities for Change, a group which works for policies that help low-income people. He called it “as terrible a choice as it is.” Mr. Cuomo is favored to win re-election; in 2014, he received more than 125,000 votes on the W.F.P. line while cruising to victory over Rob Astorino. “I cannot afford to vote for him,” said Norman Frazier, a W.F.P. member who urged members to “swallow the bullet” and support Mr. Cuomo. “And I cannot afford not to.” Lining up at opposing microphones across the room, few if any attendees on Wednesday spoke positively of the two-term governor. And many anticipated that the would face consequences for initially rebuffing him. Andrew Falk, a state committee member, said that if anyone didn’t believe Mr. Cuomo would seek to undermine the W.F.P., “I have a bridge collapsing on top of another bridge to sell you.”",The New York Times
2018,Project Baseline Aims to Ward Off Illness Before We Get Sick,"Researchers are recruiting 10,000 volunteers to discover the earliest warning signs of cancer, heart disease and other killers. One of the sobering facts about cancer treatment is that it often begins when it is already too late: Studies show that an alarming number of treatable cancers are diagnosed in the advanced stages of disease. That has long bothered Dr. Sam Gambhir, a top cancer researcher at Stanford University who lost his teenage son to brain cancer in 2015. Dr. Gambhir wondered if there were some surefire way to detect cancer long before people got sick. “In the cancer field we often find problems long after people have symptoms,” he said. “We rarely find things early.” Now Dr. Gambhir is leading a large study that seeks to better understand the transition from normal health to disease. The study, called Project Baseline, could lead to the identification of new markers in the blood, stool or urine of healthy people that help predict cancer, cardiovascular disease and other leading killers of Americans. It is a joint effort between Stanford and Duke Universities and Verily, a life sciences company owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Researchers are recruiting 10,000 adults across the United States who will be examined in extreme detail and followed intensively for at least four years. Many of the people joining the study are healthy adults, which differs from traditional medical trials that focus largely on people who are already ill. Another key difference is that the researchers are collecting a staggering amount of medical data on their subjects: analyzing their microbiomes, sequencing their genomes, subjecting them to a variety of scans and assessing their cognitive health. They are also equipping volunteers with new wearable technology from Verily that records their nightly sleep patterns and tracks their heart rhythms and physical activity. In another unusual move, the Project Baseline investigators are sharing the research results with their subjects, everything from how much plaque or calcium they find in their arteries to which bacterial strains inhabit their guts. Some experts worry, however, that providing such detailed medical data to healthy adults could lead to new problems. Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of genomics at the Scripps Research Institute in California, cautioned that the sheer amount of testing, scans and other “deep interrogations” could produce incidental findings that cause unnecessary anxiety. “Sometimes it leads to unwarranted further testing that could even be harmful,” he said. Dr. Topol is involved in a similar study, called All of Us and financed by the National Institutes of Health, which is building a “biobank” of health information collected from a million Americans. The researchers intend to return genetic data and some other results to participants but are figuring out the best way to do that. “This is the new challenge in a democratized world of medical research,” Dr. Topol said. “I’m really in favor of it, but it sets up this new issue of dealing with unexpected results that are difficult to interpret.” The Project Baseline researchers are learning this firsthand. They say they have discovered and promptly alerted participants to potentially lethal conditions that might otherwise have gone unnoticed, like cancer and aortic aneurysms, so they can seek appropriate medical care. But some of the participants have also been frightened by fairly innocuous findings, like chest X-rays that reveal small, usually benign nodules in their lungs that they may look up on the internet and think are cancerous, said Dr. Charlene Wong, a Project Baseline investigator. “For most of our participants, it will not be cancer. But we’re still in the process of working with participants to find out if we can return that data in the right way so that we minimize the anxiety it can cause,” she said. Dr. Ken Mahaffey, a Project Baseline investigator and cardiologist at Stanford, said that he and his colleagues have “a responsibility, socially, morally and ethically, to get systems in place so we can share the results with participants in ways that they can understand them and then help them engage with their own physicians and clinical providers.” Despite the anxiety it can cause, many people welcome such data. Studies like Project Baseline are especially appealing to the so-called Quantified Self movement, the growing community of people who track their every biometric with smartphone apps, high-tech gadgets and direct-to-consumer health tests. Some 2,000 people have enrolled in Project Baseline so far, and thousands more have signed up in a registry of potential volunteers who may be called on as the project expands to additional medical centers. While there have been plenty of longitudinal studies in the past, many of the largest and most important were not very diverse. The landmark Framingham heart study that began in 1948, for example, focused mostly on white adults. Dr. Svati Shah, an associate professor of medicine at Duke, said Project Baseline is recruiting many people who are black, Hispanic, Asian and other ethnicities so the study can shed light on differences in disease risk factors among people of different backgrounds. That includes people like Rosa Gonzalez, 57, a nurse who lives in Concord, N.C. Ms. Gonzalez, who is Mexican-American, joined the study earlier this year and has encouraged at least a dozen Latino friends and acquaintances to join it as well. “Other studies present data and talk about Latinos, but they don’t have Latinos in the study,” she said. “I’m trying to set an example so other Latinos see that it’s good to take part so that we can have data that shows how we’re the same or different.” Dr. Gambhir said the idea for Project Baseline was hatched in 2013, when Google executives approached him and said they wanted to do a landmark study on human health. Dr. Gambhir proposed a study to find early markers of cancer in people who are otherwise healthy. “We have always thought that if we learn more about what your body is doing before you become ill, then we would have a much better chance of ideally preventing or at least detecting things early,” he said. Google liked the idea but suggested broadening the scope to include other diseases. Verily declined to say how much it is spending on Project Baseline. But the company is investing in several areas of health care, including the development of contact lenses and miniature sensors that monitor blood sugar levels so patients with diabetes can better manage their disease. In addition to sharing results with study volunteers, Project Baseline is hosting events and webinars in which study participants can ask the researchers questions and give them suggestions. “This isn’t research that’s happening in a black box,” said Dr. Jessica Mega, Verily’s chief medical officer. “People on the ground are part of this movement.” Wondering what you should be wondering about in terms of your health?

2018,Prosecutors’ Plan for El Chapo: Tie Him to 33 Killings,"Even given the history of Mexico’s bloody drug wars, it was startling this month when federal prosecutors said they planned to offer evidence that Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the longtime leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, had taken part in no less than 33 murders. That number was high enough that on Tuesday the judge presiding over his trial in Brooklyn called it “way too much” and “out of control.” Apparently exasperated at the prospect of testimony about so many slayings, the judge, Brian M. Cogan, told the government that it hardly needed to detail every murder that Mr. Guzmán, who is known as El Chapo, is suspected of committing to make its point that he used violence to run his operation. Judge Cogan also warned the prosecution that if its presentation got too gory, he might cut it short. “This is a drug conspiracy case that involves murders,” Judge Cogan said at a hearing in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. “I’m not going to let you try a murder conspiracy case that happens to involve drugs. “Take your best shot and cut the rest,” he added. Among the victims the jury will likely hear about is Israel Rincón Martínez, a member of a rival cartel who was targeted in 2010, court papers say, after killing the son of one of Mr. Guzmán’s closest allies. Prosecutors are also expected to describe the execution of Francisco Aceves Urías, a Guzmán gunman known as Barbarino, who was slain in 2015 in the parking lot of restaurant in Culiacán, Mexico. Brutal as they are, the 33 killings Mr. Guzmán stands accused of do not reflect the full scope of the bloodshed that prosecutors plan to introduce at his trial, which starts on Monday with jury selection. They are also poised to describe how the defendant killed — or ordered the deaths of — an untold number of law enforcement officers and people who betrayed him. Everything about the Guzmán case has been supersized. Though the defendant’s nickname means “Shorty” in Spanish, he is a towering figure described in court papers as the greatest criminal of the 21st century. Hundreds of thousands of photographs and documents are likely to be introduced at his trial. At least 16 cooperating witnesses — mostly former underlings and rivals — are expected to appear on the witness stand and testify against him. [Who will testify against El Chapo at trial?] Facing this onslaught, Mr. Guzmán’s lawyers have spent the last few weeks complaining to Judge Cogan that there is no way for them to digest the pile of evidence arrayed against their client and successfully defend him. Earlier this month, they filed a motion accusing the government of inundating them with 117,000 audio recordings and 14,000 new pages of documents. To show how buried in paperwork they were, the lawyers brought the documents to court Tuesday morning and lined them up in 23 white plastic binders, stacked, one next to the other, on a table. But Judge Cogan refused their request to delay the trial again. (It has already been adjourned two times.) He also bemoaned that the defense and prosecution seemed to be in state of high anxiety, peppering him with last-minute requests and pestering him with “panicked” phone calls, sometimes on weekends. He asked both sides to settle down and implored them to lessen the tension. “I don’t think litigating by frenzy and hysteria is an appropriate way to approach this case,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Protect New Mothers at Work,"letter An advocacy group supports new and improved legislation. To the Editor: Re “Pregnant Workers Seek Respite and Are Denied, at a Cruel Cost” (front page, Oct. 22): The Pregnancy Discrimination Act prohibits firing someone for being pregnant, but doesn’t require the employer to hold a woman’s job open while she heals from giving birth. That’s why we need to update the Pregnancy Discrimination Act by passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. But we also need to supplement it with the Healthy Families Act, legislation to guarantee that everyone can earn paid sick days, and the Family Act, a bill to establish a paid family and medical leave fund. Pregnant workers need to be able to go to regular prenatal visits without fear of losing their pay or their jobs. And they need to know that they can recover from childbirth and that they and their partners can also have time to bond with a new child without facing financial disaster as a result.

2018,Protective Sportswear,"daily crossword column Kathy Wienberg supports her team. TUESDAY PUZZLE — This may come as a surprise, but I solve the puzzles pretty much the same way you do. I am not told what the contents of a given puzzle are before I solve, so my “aha!” moments are very much like your “aha!” moments, just a few days ahead of schedule. The reason I bring this up is that I have gone on record regarding what I see as a bit of an imbalance in the category of support undergarments in the crossword. The entry BRA has appeared 297 times in the New York Times Crossword, whereas the entry JOCK STRAP has appeared only once, back in 2010. (Thank you, Trip Payne: You do the Lord’s work.) It’s the kind of thing that might make those who wear bras self-conscious, and we have been waiting ever since for some sort of parity in the skivvies department, so to speak. “Everything comes to those who wait,” my mother used to say, and how right she was. Today, we bear witness to a debut revealer that at least dips a toe once again into mentioning men’s unmentionables. That was some “aha!” moment. As an added bonus, our constructor, Kathy Wienberg, applied it to sports, which was just brilliant: It’s the only arena I can think of — when I am thinking about men’s support undergarments, that is, which is not often — where such a device might be necessary. Welcome back, Ms. Wienberg. You are my new hero. 20A: Hi, kids! Before the advent of computers and other handy electronic devices, business letters (ask your folks; they were like emails, but on paper) were dictated verbally to stenographers, who wrote really quickly in shorthand and then transcribed the letter in full to send to the recipient via what we now call snail mail. There were special pads of paper on which they would write, and those were called STENO pads. 30A: Never mock the NENE, and do not ask why you should know it. If I didn’t know my obscure crossword birds, I would not have gotten the last letter in CROSSE at 13D. Of course, now that I look at it again, CROSSE makes perfect sense if you know about the sport of lacrosse. But when I was solving, I got it because I knew NENE.

An ION has a charge. 46D: “Slide presentation” gives me PowerPoint nightmares about sitting through endless business meetings, but today the clue hints at microbiology and an AMOEBA presented on a slide. The ends of four theme entries are the names of trophies, or cups, given to teams who excel in different sports. For example, at 17A, the answer to “Kid-lit character who travels via envelope” is FLAT STANLEY, and the STANLEY Cup is the trophy awarded annually to the winner of the National Hockey League playoff.

I’m happy to say that they are fully funded as of this writing, but if you’d like to get your hands on some great puzzles and help them make this a long-term project, take a look at their Kickstarter and get in on the ground floor. After I couldn’t find the revealer (ATHLETIC CUP) ever appearing in any crossword, I wanted to use the “holy grail” awarded in hockey, tennis, golf and Ping-Pong … oops, I mean soccer. When researching cups, I learned that there is a Table Tennis World Cup. (Perhaps that was a factor in this puzzle’s acceptance. Only Will knows if it refers to Ping-Pong or soccer.) It wasn’t difficult getting phrases containing DAVIS, RYDER and WORLD. I was stuck on STANLEY until I remembered a book I read to my kindergarten classes … FLAT STANLEY. That resulted in the 11-10-11-10-11 theme entry length. Hope solvers don’t mind the high three-letter word count that this layout creates. This week, my husband and I are moving to Asheville, N.C.

2018,Proud Boys Fight at G.O.P. Club Spurs Calls for Inquiry; Cuomo Blames Trump,"A brawl outside a Republican club in Manhattan involving a far-right group and anti-fascist activists spurred calls over the weekend for an investigation into the violence and whether the police handled it properly. Some Democratic politicians, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, also criticized the club for inviting the founder of the far-right group, the Proud Boys. Mr. Cuomo said he has asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into the violence that accompanied Friday’s appearance at the Metropolitan Republican Club by Gavin McInnes, a right-wing provocateur. He also assigned a State Police hate crimes unit to assist with the New York Police Department’s investigation of the fighting, which he linked to President Trump. But state Republican Party leaders accused Democrats of trying to exploit the violence for political gain. “We’re the victims here,” Deborah Coughlin, president of the Metropolitan Republican Club, said on Sunday, striking an incredulous tone after Mr. Cuomo’s remarks. The group’s building on 83rd Street on the Upper East Side had been targeted hours ahead of Mr. McInnes’s appearance by vandals who left a note that declared the attack “merely a beginning.” Mr. Cuomo, earlier Sunday, placed responsibility on the president. “Once you unleash hate and division and you demonize differences, you lose control of it. You can’t target it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It’s lighting a match in a field of dry grass. The wind takes it and it just takes off.” He also criticized the Republican club for inviting Mr. McInnes, who performed a re-enactment of the murder of a Japanese socialist. Ms. Coughlin said Mr. McInnes had been invited to return to the club after an appearance there more than a year ago. But she went to the police on Thursday evening after receiving a string of increasingly hostile phone calls from people demanding the event be canceled, she said. Videos show a heavy police presence as Mr. McInnes left the event. Dozens of counterprotesters gathered behind a police barricade across the street. Mr. McInnes said someone lobbed a bottle of urine at him, and he is later seen on video getting out of a car and drawing a sword from its sheath above his head before the police forced him back inside. Three counterprotesters were arrested and charged with assault after police officers leaving the event saw a fight that broke out several blocks away from the club, the police said, and on Sunday investigators were seeking three men for questioning in connection with the incident. The counterprotesters’ lawyer, Moira Moltzer-Cohen, said they would fight the charges. “We dispute these allegations, and I will be very surprised if the allegations do not fall apart,” she said. The police drew criticism on social media for their handling of the violence after no one associated with the Proud Boys was arrested. Letitia James, the city’s public advocate and the Democrat favored to become the next attorney general, called on the Manhattan district attorney to pursue hate crimes charges. [Read more about the clashes and the arrests.] Mr. McInnes’s group, the Proud Boys, is a self-proclaimed fraternity of “western chauvinists,” which the Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed a hate group. Ed Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party, said Democrats, including the governor, failed to immediately speak out after vandals targeted the club about 2 a.m. Friday, ahead of Mr. McInnes’s evening visit. The vandals, dressed in black, spray painted anti-fascist graffiti on the doors, glued the locks with caulk and threw bricks through the windows before darting off into the night, according to the police and Mr. Cox. “The governor does not condemn it, the governor does not say anything,” Mr. Cox said. “But then when there is later violence, he then says that it’s all Donald Trump’s fault. What kind of governor is that?” The governor acknowledged the vandalism on Sunday and expressed support for the police investigation into the incident. Geoff Berman, the executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, had condemned the vandalism as “repugnant” on Friday afternoon before Mr. McInnes’s visit. The bedlam outside the club embodied the violence between far-right groups and anti-fascist demonstrators that has been playing out across the United States. Last year, a woman died after a motorist drove through a crowd of counterprotesters at the Unite the Right rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. Members and associates of the Proud Boys have been implicated in violence since its inception. A day after the brawl in Manhattan, members participated in a march in Portland, Ore., that ended with clashes with anti-fascist counterprotesters. Video circulating on social media after the brawl on Friday night showed several people who appeared to have been involved in the fighting walking away without being arrested. The police, responding to criticism on Saturday, described what happened in a statement and said investigators were reviewing surveillance video to determine if other crimes occurred.",The New York Times
2018,Proud Boys Founder: How He Went From Brooklyn Hipster to Far-Right Provocateur,"For an hour or so, he railed about socialism and political correctness to an audience of New York establishment Republicans. As he often does, he took ugly swipes at Ivy Leaguers, left-wing snobs and lesbians with “geriatric crew cuts.” Then, when his speech was over, Gavin McInnes stepped outside of the Metropolitan Republican Club, protected by the police. Just before a brawl broke out between his allies and a crowd of shouting protesters, he waved a plastic sword in the air, slipped into a car and sped away. There was an uproar this weekend when anti-fascist demonstrators clashed with members of the far-right group Proud Boys, reprising on the streets of New York City the kind of violent rumbles that occurred across the country last year in places like New Orleans and Berkeley, Calif. But at the center of the fray on Friday night was Mr. McInnes, the founder of the Proud Boys and a former Brooklyn hipster turned far-right provocateur. With his egghead glasses, pocket-protector and heavy-drinking, angry-nerd aesthetic, Mr. McInnes has in recent years set himself apart from the current crop of professionally outraged right-wing pundits, not only for being able to spout aggressive rhetoric, but also for being willing to get physical at times. His obsessions seem to be more cultural than political. Mr. McInnes, a fiscal conservative and libertarian, calls himself a champion of Western values and reserves a burning ire for the political correctness of people on the left whom he describes as busybodies who have lost their sense of humor. “This movement is normal people trying to live their lives getting attacked by mentally ill lunatics,” he said. But his views are darker when it comes to gender roles and immigration. Mr. McInnes admits that he may be Islamaphobic (“It’s seen as xenophobic to be worried about Islam, but they appear to disproportionately allow intolerance to blossom in their communities,” he said.) He also acknowledged being something of a sexist. (“I’m an Archie Bunker sexist,” he said. “I don’t like Gloria Steinem, but I’d take a bullet for Edith.”) Though he has repudiated racism and anti-Semitism in some of his writings and speeches, he has also made statements that have openly denigrated nonwhite cultures. Last year, he wrote of white men: “We brought roads and infrastructure to India and they are still using them as toilets. Our criminals built nice roads in Australia but Aboriginals keep using them as a bed.” His critics say rhetoric like this echoes strands of white-nationalist philosophy, and that some of his followers have crossed the line at times. “Their disavowals of bigotry are belied by their actions,” the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization that tracks extremist groups, wrote in an online memo labeling the Proud Boys as a hate group. “Rank-and-file Proud Boys and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists. They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric.” Daryle Lamont Jenkins, the founder of One People Project, an anti-racist organization, said Mr. McInnes has been allowed to tread a fine line, appearing as a political commentator on mainstream outlets like Fox News while being the founder of a group involved in violent clashes. “They’ve utilized subterfuge and lies to keep that hate group tag from being applied to them,” Mr. Jenkins said. “Every time their members are seen doing things they’re not supposed to be doing, like showing up at Unite the Right, they claim that person left the Proud Boys.” On television and on frequent speaking tours, Mr. McInnes, who is 48, can often sound like a younger and more foul-mouthed President Trump, bashing feminists, mocking Black Lives Matter and deriding deep-state plotters. And like the president, he tends to publicly disavow all violence while winkingly insisting that he — and the Proud Boys — will never back down during a scrape. “We don’t start fights,” he wrote in an article last year, “but we will finish them.” In an interview this week, Mr. McInnes said he gave his speech this weekend after he called officials at the Metropolitan Republican Club and asked for permission to appear there. He arrived at the club’s headquarters on East 83rd Street on Friday night with a small contingent of Proud Boys who he said were there to “do security.” Deborah Coughlin, the president of the club, said that she welcomed Mr. McInnes because there had been no trouble when he spoke at the club last year. Ms. Coughlin explained that the club considered Mr. McInnes’ political views to be on the spectrum of conservative “civil discourse.” She also noted that during the event, his followers were quiet and respectful. But according to the police, skirmishes erupted as soon as the evening’s program ended and Mr. McInnes’s supporters confronted a group of masked left-wing protesters that had left the event and walked down Lexington Avenue to catch them. The opposing forces came face-to-face on East 82nd Street, yelling at each other as they met. A protester hurled a plastic bottle at the Proud Boys, and that, the police said, was when the punches started flying. It was not the first time that the city’s anarchists and anti-fascists have clashed with Mr. McInnes and the Proud Boys, who have often served as a private fight club ready to protect him. In February 2017, the Proud Boys were present when anti-fascists swarmed their leader as he showed up at New York University to speak to the College Republicans there. Mr. McInnes claimed that he was doused with pepper spray during the brawl that unfolded on the Greenwich Village campus. Eleven people were eventually arrested. Born in England and raised in Canada, Mr. McInnes has been a controversial figure in the news media for nearly 20 years. In 1994, after emerging from the punk-rock music scene, he co-founded Vice, the Montreal-based hipster magazine that later moved to Brooklyn and delighted audiences from the start with its graphic articles on subjects such as drug-abusing models and decomposing pigeons. While working for the magazine, he moved to Brooklyn, taking up residence in a Williamsburg apartment. He now resides in the suburbs. After leaving Vice in 2008 because of creative differences with his partners, Mr. McInnes went on to write a series of books, like “How to Piss in Public,” and articles for right-wing websites, like Taki’s Magazine and VDARE. Even in his earliest work, Mr. McInnes often took an adolescent pleasure in offending liberals, women, “beta male culture” and transgender people, writing in a voice inflected with a crass, contrarian bigotry that left him just enough room to declare it all a joke. In 2016, Mr. McInnes founded the first official chapter of the Proud Boys in New York after, he said, he realized that fans of his former television program, “The Gavin McInnes Show,” liked to spend time in his studio, drinking beer with him and telling private jokes. He has described the group, which has since spread to dozens of cities and to countries, like Australia and Japan, as an ordinary men’s club, like the Shriners or the Elks. It serves as a sort of safe space for him and what he calls his fellow “Western chauvinists.” In its guise as a fraternal organization, the Proud Boys get together in New York and other cities once a month at beery meet-ups that can draw as many as a few hundred participants. Women are not allowed at the group’s formal gatherings (though they are permitted at the “warm up” sessions, Mr. McInnes has written). As a character-building exercise, the Proud Boys forbid both masturbation and the watching of pornography. The group’s initiation rituals include reciting the names of five breakfast cereals while being slugged by other members. The monthly meet-ups are largely “social events where people have fun and laugh and drink and share stories about their kids and businesses and stuff like that,” said Pawl Bazile, the editor of Proud Boy magazine. “It’s a celebration of the West, of America and of freedom and liberty.” But in the last two years, members of the group have also had a second preoccupation, taking part in a string of violent street fights with their anti-fascist rivals in cities like Berkeley, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. Sometimes accompanied by skinheads, neo-Nazis, modern-day Confederates and outfits like the Oath Keepers, an association of law-enforcement officers and military veterans, the Proud Boys have scuffled with the left at May Day rallies, so-called free-speech protests and at marches in support of President Trump. While the Proud Boys accept minority members, they have at times joined forces with overtly racist organizations. Jason Kessler, who once attended Proud Boy meetings in Virginia, organized the violent rallies in Charlottesville, Va., last year that attracted neo-Nazi groups. One former Proud Boy, Rich Black, was among the planners of two violent rallies in Berkeley in 2017 that were attended by white supremacist groups. Mr. McInnes did not go to Charlottesville and explicitly forbade the Proud Boys from attending. “To be clear, all white nationalists/anti-Semites are banned from Proud Boys even if they never bring up said topics,” he wrote in an article shortly after the violence in Virginia. And yet, among those who attended his event on Friday night were a few alleged members of a local skinhead group, the 211 Boot Boys, and the founder of a record label called United Riot that releases albums from local skinhead punk bands. United Riot organized a fund-raiser last year for Andrew Kuklis, a Long Island member of the 211 Boot Boys who was arrested in January 2017 on firearms charges. In a text message on Monday, Mr. McInnes denied he had connections with the 211 Boot Boys, saying, “I don’t represent them and I have no idea who they all are and what they stand for.” He also said on Monday on his show “Get Off My Lawn,” on the CRTV streaming network, that he could not understand why the Proud Boys had been blamed for the rioting last week when Antifa had started the conflict, placing threatening phone calls to the Metropolitan Republican Club and vandalizing its property. “Article after article has this narrative where they took a fight that happened for maybe five seconds, and they ignored the previous three days of extremist, leftist violence,” he said. Mr. McInnes’s confusion did little to win over Republicans like William F. B. O’Reilly, who was president of the club from 1998 to 2002. “The Republican brand doesn’t need this,” Mr. O’Reilly said of Mr. McInnes and the Proud Boys. “It’s already got enough problems.” He added, “There was no reason to invite that ilk to the Silk Stocking district in New York.”",The New York Times
2018,Psychedelic Mushrooms Are Closer to Medicinal Use (It’s Not Just Your Imagination),"Researchers from Johns Hopkins University have recommended that psilocybin, the active compound in hallucinogenic mushrooms, be reclassified for medical use, potentially paving the way for the psychedelic drug to one day treat depression and anxiety and help people stop smoking. The suggestion to reclassify psilocybin from a Schedule I drug, with no known medical benefit, to a Schedule IV drug, which is akin to prescription sleeping pills, was part of a review to assess the safety and abuse of medically administered psilocybin. Before the Food and Drug Administration can be petitioned to reclassify the drug, though, it has to clear extensive study and trials, which can take more than five years, the researchers wrote. The analysis was published in the October print issue of Neuropharmacology, a medical journal focused on neuroscience. The study comes as many Americans shift their attitudes toward the use of some illegal drugs. The widespread legalization of marijuana has helped demystify drug use, with many people now recognizing the medicinal benefits for those with anxiety, arthritis and other physical ailments. Psychedelics, like LSD and psilocybin, are illegal and not approved for medical or recreational use. But in recent years scientists and consumers have begun rethinking their use to combat depression and anxiety. “We are seeing a demographic shift, particularly among women,” said Matthew Johnson, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins and one of the study’s authors. Among the research he has conducted, he said, “we’ve had more females in our studies.” Microdosing, or the use of psychedelics in small, managed doses, has become a popular way to try to increase productivity and creative thinking, particularly among the technorati in Silicon Valley. It’s even a plot point in the CBS show “The Good Fight.” Dr. Johnson said that in 2005, he volunteered to work in the “bad trip” tent at Burning Man, the festival in the Nevada desert known for rampant drug use. For decades, though, researchers have shunned the study of psychedelics. “In the 1960s, they were on the cutting edge of neuroscience research and understanding how the brain worked,” Dr. Johnson said. “But then it got out of the lab.” Research stopped, in part, because the use of mind-altering drugs like LSD and mushrooms became a hallmark of hippie counterculture. The researchers who conducted the new study included Roland R. Griffiths, a professor in the departments of psychiatry and neurosciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who is one of the most prominent researchers on the behavioral and subjective effects of mood-altering drugs. The researchers reviewed data going back to the 1940s. Dr. Johnson said that the F.D.A. had approved a number of trials of psilocybin. If its use is approved for patients, he said, “I see this as a new era in medicine.” He added, “The data suggests that psychedelics are powerful behavioral agents.” In legal studies, he said, participants are given a capsule with synthetic psilocybin. (They are not given mushrooms to eat, which is how the drug is most often ingested.) He warned, though, that psilocybin is not a panacea for everyone. In their analysis, the researchers called for strict controls on its use. There are areas of risk, too, for patients with psychotic disorders and anyone who takes high doses of the drug.",The New York Times
2018,Public Resources Belong to Us All. But Who Decides What to Do With Them?,"Letter 76 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email. Here’s where to find all our Oceania coverage. ______ When should public resources be used for a particular interest group? Who gets to choose and how can decisions for the few be countered by the many? Questions like these rose to a shout in Australia this week, from culture to science to academia. It’s always risky to connect such disparate subjects — each has its own context. But as I write from cold, quiet Canberra, I think it’s worth recognizing that a number of recent public debates have all included something vital for democracy: a moment of grass-roots awakening. At a time when apathy is on the rise, this was a week of engagement and lively argument about national and international affairs. Let’s go through a few examples and why they stood out. • Whose House? Our House The fight over whether the sails of the Opera House should be used to advertise for the Everest horse race brought out thousands of protesters who insisted that Australia’s most famous building not be used as a billboard for gambling. We had a reporter in the crowd. Here’s her piece, which aims to put the dispute into context, noting that for some, it was the equivalent of putting a gambling ad on Stonehenge or the Statue of Liberty. → What I found interesting: The fact that a brief light show quickly took on momentous meaning, tapping into frustrations that may shape the next federal election: When, many asked, will Sydney and Australia stop taking their cues from the conservative old guard? • The Uni Wars Commence Australia’s universities are increasingly dependent on fee-paying foreign students with the largest share of them coming from China. This week, a divide on how to handle that became more apparent. Peter Varghese, the chancellor of the University of Queensland, and the former head of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, gave a much-discussed speech arguing that the country’s institutions of higher learning needed to reduce their reliance on Chinese students. He suggested drawing from other countries and even setting aside revenue for a day when Chinese students stopped flooding Australian campuses, because of university growth within China, or a Chinese blockade caused by rising tensions. (He also called for more government support.) “What lies ahead looks more complicated at best and gloomy at worst,” he said. → What I found interesting: Mr. Varghese appears to be a bold outlier in the Australian university world. In China this week, a group of vice chancellors from Australia’s eight largest universities told Chinese officials that there was no reason to worry or slow enrollments. Their message: Keep the money (and students) coming. • The Reef as Resource It’s not every day that the United Nations scientific panel on climate change comes out and declares that the only way to avoid catastrophe is by transforming the world economy within just a few years. It’s also not every day that the Australian government rushes to dismiss such findings, doubling down on coal and rejecting calls for the world to shift away from it by 2050, despite dire warnings for the Great Barrier Reef and other ocean ecosystems. → What I found interesting: The government’s stance notwithstanding, the United Nations report stirred a lot of discussion about the tough choices climate change will require. And though it’s a global issue, climate and the power of the coal industry is increasingly becoming local: Malcolm Turnbull’s son, Alex, and a renowned coral reef scientist, Terry Hughes, are both campaigning on the issue in the Wentworth by-election. Of course, it’s not clear that any of these responses will change Australian politics anytime soon. The Opera House still showed its Everest ad; universities are continuing with the status quo; Australia is no closer to creating a coherent climate policy. But efforts to shake up Australia are on the rise — or at least they were this week. Tell me where you think it’s all heading by email (nytaustralia@nytimes.com) or by commenting in our NYT Australia Facebook group. Also, thanks to everyone who volunteered to join our reader dinners in Sydney this week. Sorry we don’t have room for you all but I’ll share some of the discussion in next week’s newsletter to get a better sense of whether what we hear resonates. Now for our stories of the world, good and bad, happy and sad. ______ Scholars tend to discuss geopolitics from high above, gaming out strategy and long-term goals. But global power is also human. And it’s more cruel than kind. The case of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who disappeared in Turkey and may have been killed in the Saudi consulate, is emerging as a shocking and prominent example. Meng Hongwei, the president of Interpol, is another. This week he went from China’s shining example of international leadership to a mysterious mark of Chinese politics after officials detained him on corruption charges. So, too, has global conflict burst into view for a Chinese intelligence official, who was recently arrested in Belgium and brought to the United States to face economic espionage charges — a dramatic escalation of the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on Chinese spying. ______ What else do we have for you this week, besides that Opera House story I mentioned? How about a profile of Mason Cox, the big Texan footy star! You asked us to tell the world about him. We delivered. As promised, we also have another big thoughtful feature from rural Australia, this one about a pastor in Wee Waa trying to hold together a community and a church in the middle of the drought. And it’s not just the Great Barrier Reef that’s threatened by climate change. Here’s a batch of other ocean ecosystems in Australia that are in serious trouble. ______ Start with our review of “A Star Is Born,” then read our critic’s take on how Bradley Cooper, in his directorial debut, managed to reimagine the Hollywood classic. “The more I consider how Cooper depicts the ebbs and flows of their relationship, the more I find this latest version intriguing in the way it complicates an already complicated narrative,” Aisha Harris writes. “If it maintains some of the more questionable aspects of the original story, it also tries to push against them for a modern audience.” ______ This week’s Smarter Living newsletter goes out to all of us who want to believe we’re about to hit it big. “A study published in Nature found that about 90 percent of people will experience a ‘hot streak’ in their career, which is that span of a few years when a person’s greatest, most effective work is produced. And — here’s the good part — your hot streak can appear at any point in your working life, meaning that it’s never too late (or too early) to hit your peak.” ______ What does is mean to be 18? Is it a major transition, a blip, a breakthrough? The New York Times wanted to understand what it meant for girls turning 18 in 2018 around the world so we enlisted young female photographers to profile them for a boldly designed interactive feature called #ThisIs18 — through girls’ eyes. There are fascinating young women from all over here, including Australia. Check it out and join the fun.

2018,"Pull Up a Seat. Two Plays, Dinner and Western History Are Served.","For the first time in more than a dozen plays, Samuel D. Hunter has left Idaho altogether. By about a half mile. “Lewiston/Clarkston,” easily the most ambitious staging of Mr. Hunter’s work to date, has the hallmarks that have made him one of the most acclaimed playwrights of his era: fine-grained distillations of forgiveness and faith, an eagerness to engage with people on all sides of the country’s economic and religious divides. But this time the entire second half of the evening — an immersive diptych presented by Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, complete with a communal meal — takes place just across the Idaho-Washington border, which is delineated by the Snake River. Not to worry, according to Chris, one of the three “Clarkston” characters. “The bridge is just like a three-minute drive down there,” he counsels Jake, a fellow Costco employee — and a distant relative of William Clark, half of the 1804 Lewis and Clark expedition that provided these two cities with their names. A total of 51 Rattlestick audience members are currently making their own pilgrimage over the course of “Lewiston/Clarkston,” which opens Oct. 25. While Mr. Hunter had always conceived of a combined evening, both “Lewiston” (which similarly features some of Meriwether Lewis’s relatives) and “Clarkston” received individual regional stagings in 2016. “I needed to treat them as two separate things and get each of them on their feet first,” he said. And when Daniella Topol, who took over as artistic director of Rattlestick two years ago, approached Mr. Hunter about tackling something larger, they decided to gut the Rattlestick space and essentially turn it into two different theaters. “We’re always intimate,” Ms. Topol said of Rattlestick, which presented Mr. Hunter’s “The Few” in 2014. “But we’re going into radical intimacy here.” The first half of the evening — “Lewiston,” a melancholy family reunion set at a bedraggled roadside fireworks stand — operates within a small space even by Mr. Hunter’s miniaturist standards. “The whole thing is just 38 feet by 12 feet, which is ridiculous,” said the “Lewiston/Clarkston” director, Davis McCallum. A moving wall separates that space from a prearranged dining area. Through a series of traffic-control measures — barbecue chicken (or tofu) and coleslaw over here, coffee and dessert over there — the “Lewiston” space as well as the original dining area are converted mid-meal into a larger playing area for “Clarkston,” set in and around a Costco. “This is basically two-thirds of our season,” Ms. Topol said of the production, which has a considerably longer run than a typical Rattlestick show, in part because of the smaller seating capacity. The cast includes Noah Robbins (“Forever”) and Leah Karpel, a veteran of several plays by Mr. Hunter. Both “Lewiston” and “Clarkston” talk obliquely about Lewis, Clark and their expedition, but Mr. Hunter said they use this tight focus to raise far broader ideas. “As individual plays, they’re each very small and delicate and kind of quiet,” he said. “But here they turn into two points on a map that calibrate one another and make the themes wider. It becomes more like a question and a response.” Mr. McCallum describes that central question as one that hinges on American self-definition, both in the 19th century and today. “What are the things we put our faith in as Americans?” he said. “What are the mythologies we invest in?” While the creators considered letting audiences see the plays over multiple days or just see one, as with “Angels in America” and “The Norman Conquests,” they decided to consistently begin with “Lewiston” and segue to “Clarkston.” And although people are assigned seats to “Lewiston,” the hope is that mealtime conversations will spill into a looser, less regimented seating arrangement for the second half. (Theaters will have the option in the future of producing either or both of the plays. First up is Boise Contemporary Theater, which will present the two works in repertory in February.) “You’re not just sitting in the dark for 90 minutes in this receptive mood,” Mr. Hunter said. “We all sit together and eat together and go through this together. In this moment in American history, where we’re all treading very lightly on very thin ice, I think that can be very helpful.” Mr. Hunter, a native of Moscow, Idaho, has said repeatedly that his works — which have chronicled a morbidly obese writing instructor (“The Whale”), a newspaper for truckers (“The Few”) and a group of young missionaries (“The Harvest”) — dovetail in terms of tone as well as the Idaho setting. But with “Lewiston/Clarkston,” these affinities come into starker relief: Tiny references to one of the two plays bleed into the other, and the two works end on the same day. “I’m trying not to make it too tricksy,” Mr. Hunter said. “But I do think these plays speak to one another in quiet ways.” One such overlap involves the actor Heidi Armbruster, who plays a troubled mother in “Clarkston” (a role she created at the Dallas Theater Center in 2015) and also recorded the audio for an unseen family member in “Lewiston.” “Both plays talk a lot about the thrill and the promise of the American dream versus the reality of it,” Ms. Armbruster said. “And even though that can be kind of dark, Sam’s plays are fueled by this sort of revolutionary kindness.” Promotional materials push the idea of the evening broaching the “end of the American experiment,” an idea posed at times by the mainstays of these two towns and at times by the coastal youngsters who have just arrived. (One character has fled an urban farm in Seattle, the other a Vermont education in post-colonial gender studies.) As one character says in “Clarkston,” “It’s a terrible time to be alive. There’s just nothing left to discover.” Surely this sentiment isn’t shared by its author, who is just now creeping beyond the self-imposed boundaries that have earned him an Obie Award and a MacArthur “genius grant”? Or by Rattlestick, which has gutted its space to incorporate Mr. Hunter’s snug yet capacious vision? Mr. Hunter’s response was framed a bit by his new responsibilities: He and his husband, the dramaturge John Baker, became parents this year. In fact, he had come to that day’s rehearsals directly from a frantic — and ultimately innocuous — early-morning trip to the pediatrician. “My daughter is likely — hopefully — going to live to see the year 2100,” Mr. Hunter said. “I now feel like I don’t have the luxury of being pessimistic.” And so several of the “Lewiston/Clarkston” characters as well as their creator find themselves exploring newer, larger, hopefully brighter possibilities — one half mile at a time.",The New York Times
2018,Push It: 5 Style Challenges,"Browsing Shop a little more creatively this fall. The shows are over, the trends declared: For spring 2019, we’re talking crochet, tie-dye, bike shorts galore. But beyond the obvious themes from the collections, there were plenty of smaller moments that served up sartorial inspiration, thanks to pieces that left us wondering, “Hey, how do we pull that off in real life?” Here, five such moments that nudge us to think past the big trends and shop a little more creatively. The Inspiration: Raf Simons’s “Jaws” tees weren’t the only throwback at Calvin Klein. Kaia Gerber walked the runway in the ultimate nostalgia item: a graduation cap. The Translation: Donning an actual mortarboard isn’t for the faint of heart, but why not riff on its back-to-school vibe with a different item? A patch-covered backpack or varsity jacket will lend your outfit just the right amount of high school swagger. Miu Miu mini backpack, $1,690 at Saks Fifth Avenue, saksfifthavenue.com; Opening Ceremony wool-blend varsity jacket, $395 at Saks Fifth Avenue; saksfifthavenue.com. The Inspiration: At Chanel, more was a lot more — at least when it comes to purses — as models bounded through the Grand Palais with twin bags slung around their shoulders. The Translation: Forget bankrupting yourself with two identical handbags. Instead, approximate the look with one carefully chosen purchase that smacks of carbon-copy coolness (a two-tier purse, a double buckle belt). Malibu Skye faux leather belt bag, $58 at nordstrom.com; Maison Margiela perforated leather double belt, $575 at farfetch.com. The Inspiration: A high-voltage, thigh-high boot paired with a demure oxford (in clashing colors and patterns, no less). What else would you expect from the irrepressible conceptualist Thom Browne? The Translation: If it seems a little too radical for real life, try a subtler version of mismatching, one that will jolt some energy into your current accessories without overpowering the rest of your outfit. Jacquemus sling-backs with mismatched wooden heels, $665 at ssense.com; Isabel Marant hoop earrings with one charm, $268 at luisaviaroma.com. The Inspiration: A sweater tied over an overcoat? It’s a move that defies logic (and restricts range of motion). But, practicality be damned, it’s definitely cool, in the textbook Galliano-Margiela fashion. The Translation: Reach for an already layered piece that’s slightly confusing in the best way possible — wait, which one went on first? — but, unlike the Margiela, lets you move your limbs. Sandy Liang cotton-canvas pants with contrast skirt, $550 at net-a-porter.com; Junya Watanabe layered wool and satin dress, $2,120 at net-a-porter.com. The Inspiration: Sometimes precious little (really, just some suede strings, plus a few beads) can add surprising depth to an outfit. That was the clever detail at Ferragamo. The Translation: For a look less reminiscent of “Waterworld,” opt for a netted bag or latticed skirt that is every bit as texturally interesting. Rachel Comey embellished net skirt, $1,975 at modaoperandi.com; Zara beaded mesh bag, $89.90 at Zara, zara.com.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Putting Profits Over People,"letter Shareholder value began taking precedence over employee loyalty and well-being in the 1980s, a reader writes. To the Editor: Re “In Its Heyday, Sears Spread the Wealth. Companies Today Don’t” (front page, Oct. 24): When I began teaching management to M.B.A. students in 1971, a major company goal was customer satisfaction through outstanding employee performance. Great emphasis was placed on employee motivation, performance and loyalty to the company to maximize customer satisfaction. Frederick Herzberg’s theory of “job enrichment” and Abraham Maslow’s “self-actualization” were introduced to students as methods to add meaning and challenge to jobs and to stress employment achievement. Then in the mid-1980s the emphasis shifted to shareholder value, and many employers began to view employees as commodities to be bought and sold. The profits and stock prices in quarterly and annual reports became the holy grail of organizational effectiveness. Pensions disappeared, employee loyalty declined, and the result has been an unfortunate decline of the American employee. James G. GoodaleHouston",The New York Times
2018,Pérez Art Museum Miami Recalls Pink Islands,"MIAMI — It might have been the first time a traffic jam in South Florida ended in smiles. On the afternoon of May 7, 1983, cars began to slow down on the causeways that sail over Biscayne Bay and connect Miami Beach with the mainland. Many motorists stopped altogether, hopping out onto the road for a better look at the surreal sight in the bay: 11 small, uninhabited islands were newly surrounded by 6.5 million square feet of pink woven polypropylene fabric, each looking like a 200-foot-wide, pastel-colored lily pad, shimmering in the tropical sunlight. This cultural moment is now receiving a deep dive at the Pérez Art Museum Miami with “Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Surrounded Islands, Biscayne Bay, Greater Miami, Florida, 1980-1983/A Documentary Exhibition,” an exhaustive chronicle of the project from conception through legal hurdles to the nuts and bolts of its waterborne installation. The show celebrates not only the 35th anniversary of “Surrounded Islands” — a spectacle with an oddly matter-of-fact title by the Bulgarian-born and New York City-based artist Christo and his artistic partner and wife, Jeanne-Claude — but also the de facto 35th anniversary of the museum itself. The institution’s earliest precursor, the Center for the Fine Arts, opened its doors in January 1984, basking in the afterglow of “Surrounded Islands” and hoping to appeal to a mass audience that was primed for fresh thinking about avant-garde artwork. That connection was particularly resonant for René Morales, a curator at the Pérez, who adapted the show from a European iteration. He had witnessed “Surrounded Islands” firsthand as an 8-year-old, having arrived in Miami from Cuba with his family three years earlier. “What I remember more than the project itself is the look on my father’s face,” Mr. Morales recalled of their trip to a spot above it. “This look of excitement and wonder! Throughout my career, I’ve always thought back on that as what I want to do with my work. I love the idea of helping artists create that same sense of wonder in an audience.” “What’s so inspiring, not just for a curator here in Miami, but for any museum worker anywhere,” Mr. Morales continued, “is this idea of attaining an art form that is able to speak directly to people across the full gamut of society without the need of an institutional framework around it.” Even better, he added, is that “this isn’t taking place out in the middle of nowhere, where you have to make a journey, and only the art cognoscenti know about it. This is smack in the middle of the city.” Still, while “Surrounded Islands” may be widely celebrated today as a transcendent experience — and a celebratory turning point for a city then reeling from a vast crime wave, recurring racial violence and endemic civic corruption — support for it was anything but universal in May 1983. Over the preceding months, interest in Christo’s project had reached a fever pitch, spiked by exhaustive media coverage and even an anti-Christo performance artist who grabbed headlines. It seemed as if everyone in Miami had an opinion on it, from supporters wearing “I Dig Pink” T-shirts and “Go for It Christo” buttons to ecologists who filed lawsuits, fearing damage to the bay and its marine life. The author and conservationist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, a driving force behind the Florida environmental movement, dismissed “Surrounded Islands” as “perfectly ridiculous,” adding, “I can’t imagine why anyone would want to go see these things.” And even some in the art world remained dubious. Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in an appearance on the ABC News program “Nightline,” said with a sneer that Christo’s handiwork was “to true art as an oil slick is to the Sistine ceiling.” But once “Surrounded Islands” became a reality, with pelicans arcing overhead, manatees mating underneath, and spellbound onlookers circling by land, sea and air for its two-week duration, even the most strident critics came around. Bill Cosford, an arts columnist for The Miami Herald who had previously written a string of blistering attacks on the project as “aesthetically offensive,” promptly published a heartfelt mea culpa on behalf of his fellow skeptics: “We wised up, like foxhole atheists, once the thing was in place.” Christo himself remains hesitant to dissect the ultimate meaning of his “Surrounded Islands,” even 35 years later. “Jeanne-Claude would say we are simply borrowing a public space to create a gentle disturbance,” he mused in a recent telephone interview about his partner, who died in 2009. “Everything inherent in that space becomes a work of art. We did not invent ecology in Biscayne Bay. We didn’t create the politics around it.” But all of that, he continued, was as much a part of the artwork as the pink fabric. Even the people opposing his project were still thinking about art — even, or especially, if they had never previously given much thought to the nature of it. “That is why we never do commissions,” he said, “we always do projects where the energy is created by the process of getting permission. There are no grants, no foundations, no government funding.” The entire $3.1 million budget for “Surrounded Islands” came from Christo himself, via the sale of his preparatory sketches and models. Today, it might be tempting to see “Surrounded Islands” as not only ground zero for the expansion of Miami’s contemporary art scene, but also as the template for the annual Art Basel Miami Beach fair, which has enormous local popularity. Over-the-top events that take over and temporarily transform the entire city, appealing to dazzled throngs who rarely set foot inside a museum the rest of the year, they seem to share DNA. And despite their populist appeal, both are events powered solely by the art market’s rarefied sliver of wealthy collectors. Yet Mr. Morales bristled at such a comparison, noting that much of the frenzied activity around Art Basel was organized by those who parachute into town without any connection to Miami’s homegrown art milieu. “The art community didn’t get plopped down here by aliens,” he said. “It’s a deeply rooted part of our city and it has evolved over decades. It didn’t just land on a spaceship called Basel.” Indeed, years before Christo’s arrival, Miami was home to a creatively thriving crew of artists, including the sculptor Robert Thiele and the painter Salvatore La Rosa, both selected for the 1975 Whitney Biennial; the painter Robert Huff, whose sprawling murals, including one inside the Miami airport, often stopped intrigued travelers short; and the painter Lynne Golub Gelfman, now receiving a long-overdue solo show at the Pérez. Instead, Mr. Morales argued, the real lesson from “Surrounded Islands” should be to forget about the art market altogether and focus on how two single individuals — Christo and Jeanne-Claude — were able to capture the imagination of an entire city. “It’s so much about showing the potential of freeing oneself from pre-existing parameters like, ‘If it doesn’t make money, then why do it?’” he said. “If you can free yourself from that kind of mental stoppage, look at what great things can happen!”",The New York Times
2018,"Quake Hits Indonesia, and Deaths Are Reported","At least three people died when a 6.0-magnitude earthquake shook the East Java and Bali regions of Indonesia on Thursday morning, a government spokesman said. The epicenter was about 25 miles northeast of Sumberanyar at a depth of about six miles, the United States Geological Service reported. The quake comes just two weeks after Sulawesi, in eastern Indonesia, suffered a 7.5-magnitude earthquake followed by a tsunami. More than 2,000 people have been confirmed killed by the natural disasters. Many more are believed to have died, been buried under soil, swept away by waves or trapped in a tangle of crushed buildings that will take months, if not years, to clear. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster management agency, wrote on Twitter that no tsunami was expected from the latest quake. The agency said Thursday’s quake was felt for up to five seconds in some areas, toppling some houses. The initial victims were trapped in their homes, it said.",The New York Times
2018,Quaker Bets Oat Milk Is More Than Just a Passing Fad,"These days, a trip to the grocery store to pick up milk can be a daunting task. Not only are there new spins on traditional cow’s milk — ultra-filtered? grass-fed? — but there are also a dizzying array of alternatives made from soy, rice, coconuts, almonds, cashews, hemp and even peas. Now, Quaker Oats is muscling its way into the aisle with a version based on the grain that made it famous. In January, the company plans to bring Quaker Oat Beverage — not “milk,” perhaps because of the debate over whether the word is appropriate for nondairy drinks — to the mass market. It will use the distribution might of its parent company, PepsiCo, in hopes of claiming a big piece of a fast-growing sector. [Read our article about the dispute over what qualifies as milk.] The beverage is part of PepsiCo’s push to expand its portfolio beyond sugary sodas and salty snacks to healthier options. Milk alternatives were originally geared toward people unable to stomach cow’s milk because they were lactose intolerant. But as vegans and other buyers embraced the plant-based choices, sales in the United States rose to more than $2 billion last year, up 61 percent from five years earlier, according to the research firm Mintel. Oat milk, while gaining popularity in parts of Europe, has been mostly a trendy, fringe product in the United States. Quaker is betting it can be more than that. The company’s main competitor in the category is Oatly, a 25-year-old company based in Sweden, and its namesake drink. Oatly tiptoed into the United States market about two years ago, persuading small coffee chains like Intelligentsia and some stand-alone shops to use its dairy milk alternative. Oatly quickly developed a cultlike following among the coffee elite as baristas took of advantage of its consistency — thicker than other plant-based options — to whip up lattes and other foamy drinks. (How does it taste? Well, like Quaker’s version, a little like oats.) After spreading from a small number of coffee shops in New York to more than 2,000 nationwide in a little over a year, Oatly began to sell its milk at Wegman’s, Whole Foods, ShopRite and other grocery stores this year. The brisk growth of milk alternatives is bad news for the dairy industry, which has experienced a decades-long decline in milk consumption. And as more plant-based beverages come to market, grocers have increased the fees they charge dairy milk brands to maintain their spots in the refrigerated aisles. That has cut into what were already slim profit margins for dairy milk producers, who have been loath to raise prices for fear of accelerating the decline in demand, according to analysts at the research firm CoBank Knowledge Exchange. Some milk producers have responded by jumping onto the plant-based bandwagon. Dean Foods, a leading supplier of dairy milk, is a majority investor in Good Karma Foods, which makes flax milk. And after Elmhurst Dairy, the last remaining milk company in New York City, stopped producing milk in 2016, it turned to making Elmhurst Milked, a line of drinks made from hazelnuts, almonds and oats. Quaker hopes to distinguish its offering by promoting what it says are its health benefits, primarily that it contains beta-glucan, a soluble fiber from oat bran, that might reduce the risk of heart disease. “Oats are good for you,” Robbert Rietbroek, Quaker Foods North America’s general manager, said. “They’re good for your heart. They reduce cholesterol. They’re good for your gut, and they give you long-lasting energy.” Health professionals are more reserved about such claims. “How much do you have to drink to get the recommended daily amount of soluble fiber?” asked Marion Nestle, a retired professor who specialized in nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. The answer: four eight-once glasses. “Or you could just eat a bowl of oatmeal,” Ms. Nestle said, laughing. “For the population of people who are buying these products, the health benefits from this incremental change are going to be small,” she added. “These people are already eating healthily.”",The New York Times
2018,Queensland Becomes Latest Australian State to Decriminalize Abortion,"SYDNEY, Australia — State lawmakers in Queensland voted on Wednesday to decriminalize abortion, scrapping a century-old law that had made it an offense punishable with prison time and making it the latest Australian state to loosen its restrictions. The effort prevailed after activists had tried and failed for decades to gain the traction needed to overturn the law in a state known for entrenched conservatism. This time, the legislation was able to move forward after the leader of the opposition party allowed its members to vote their conscience, rather than follow party guidance. Several of its members voted in favor of the legislation. It also comes at a time when the Queensland Parliament has achieved a notable level of representation for women: The premier, the head of the government, is a woman, the first in Australia to be elected to two terms. Her deputy is a woman, and so is half of her cabinet. And, in another first, the opposition is also led by a woman. “History has been made,” Annastacia Palaszczuk, Queensland’s premier, said in a post on Twitter after the vote. “Women will no longer have the fear of committing a crime when making the deeply personal decisions over their own bodies.” Opponents of the legislation called the development devastating and said they were ready to campaign against members of Parliament who voted for it. “The fight will continue,” one anti-abortion group, Cherish Life, told its supporters after the vote. “The unborn need us more than ever.” The new law will allow for a pregnancy to be terminated up to 22 weeks, or beyond that with the approval of two doctors. The legislation also creates 150-meter zones around clinics where activists are forbidden from protesting and requires doctors who object to performing abortions to refer patients elsewhere. It takes the place of a criminal code from 1899 that was based on a British law that was itself overturned some 50 years ago. Though abortion was rarely prosecuted in Queensland, a 19-year-old woman faced criminal charges in 2009 after officials said she used medication smuggled from Ukraine to induce a miscarriage. Over the past decade, most of Australia’s states and territories have reduced restrictions on abortion. New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, is now the only state where abortion remains a criminal offense. In Queensland, efforts to change the law had failed repeatedly, including an attempt last year that was withdrawn before lawmakers could vote. Political analysts said one difference this time was that the State Parliament has more women, including in leadership roles. Both major parties are led by women for the first time, with Deb Frecklington becoming leader of the opposition Liberal National Party last year, while Ms. Palaszczuk leads the governing Labor Party. Ms. Frecklington opposed the legislation but said she supported a conscience vote in keeping with party policy on “matters about the creation and ending of life.” Some expressed optimism that the elevated role of women would influence the debate on an issue that affects them but which has long been legislated by men. The debate in Parliament, which stretched over two days, included lawmakers sharing personal experiences. Some spoke of their own miscarriages, and one lawmaker, Ted Sorensen, became emotional as he explained his opposition, saying that he had been adopted and the legislation could have been called the “kill Ted bill.” “There is a real baby there,” he said. “I was one of them.” But others argued that women had the right to autonomy over their bodies. Nikki Boyd, a Labor member, called for “much less stigma, judgment and aggression.”",The New York Times
2018,Question After ‘Hey!’,"daily crossword column Bruce Haight and Erik Agard offer an illuminating concept. FRIDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember when I told you that yesterday’s puzzle, which was a tribute to an event being held on Saturday, was scheduled for a Thursday because it was the closest themed puzzle day to the event? Scratch that. We have a mini-themed Friday. But there’s a reason for that. The reason, the puzzle editors told me, is because today’s puzzle by Bruce Haight and Erik Agard fulfilled the requirements for a Friday puzzle despite the theme — Friday-level vocabulary and cluing, low word count — and Johanna Fenimore and Jeff Chen’s puzzle was more of a Thursday-level “trick.” “When we run mini-themed puzzles on the weekends, they’re typically still below the 72 word count and have lively vocabulary,” the digital puzzles editor Joel Fagliano said. “Occasionally, we’ll actually run extremely hard themes on Saturday.” In the case of Ms. Fenimore’s puzzle, though, “it was more of a regular trick, so it worked best on Thursday. It was a little odd to not run it on the actual day, but the alternative would have been to run it in 2020 when they finally aligned on a Thursday, so we opted to run it now.” And that, my friends, is why you see a picture in your grid on a Friday. But also because this mini-theme happens to be a great idea. 1A: Why is NESS the “Bitter end?” Because we are not looking for a bitter end as in the fallout from a breakup; we’re supposed to be thinking about a possible ending to the word “bitter,” and today, that suffix is NESS, as in bitterNESS. 31A: Nice misdirection. Normally, “Don’t you think you’re milking it a bit too much?” is asking whether someone has gone overboard in looking for sympathy. And I’m not sure I’ve ever seen bovine snark in the crossword, but if someone was milking a cow too much, I’m sure the cow would have something to say about it, like MOO. 41A: TIL that the Greeks had six different words for types of love. Three of these were philia, for deep friendship, which was highly prized by the Greeks; agape, or “love for everyone,” which was later translated into caritas, the origin of the word “charity;” and EROS, for sexual passion and named for the Greek god of fertility. 61A: Oh yes, that’s the word BADASS in the New York Times Crossword. It’s appearing for only the second time. 2D: TI (also) L about ECHOBOOMERS, also known as a subgroup of millennials. Supposedly, they are offspring of baby boomers and have similar spending patterns, hence the “Echo.” I don’t know, I can’t keep track. This article describes them better than I can. 13D: The phrase THAT IS TO SAY is particularly poetic to my ears, so I was surprised to learn that it hasn’t appeared in the puzzle in nearly 60 years. 23D: I had MEGA___ and was momentarily confused by the spelling of the band’s name. As any metalhead pedantic will tell you, it’s properly spelled MEGADETH. 53D: This is the director AVA DuVernay’s 11th appearance in the New York Times crossword, and her Twitter fans love to let her know when she’s in there. You can follow this talented film auteur at @ava. This mini-theme has three elements: two entries and a graphic made from the black squares, which is almost a trademark for Mr. Haight. The graphic is a LIGHT BULB, which is an entry stretching across the picture itself at 49A. The other theme entry, at 17A, are the words after “Hey!,” WHAT’S THE BIG IDEA? And the BIG IDEA, if you were wondering, happens to be this puzzle. Bruce Haight: Erik is the reigning A.C.P.T. champion, having blown through a super tough finals puzzle in the record time of 4 minutes 58 seconds in March. So many people wanted so badly for him to get his first win there, and for him to do it in such dramatic fashion was amazing. In 2017, he was also named one of the two crossword constructors of the year by the crossword blog Diary of a Crossword Fiend. When you work with a brilliant 25-year-old like Erik, you just try to stay out of his way and not embarrass yourself. The “grid-art” here was my idea, but Erik came up with the fabulous second theme entry WHAT’S THE BIG IDEA. He also came up with about 90 percent of the fill on this grid — the inside of the bulb was particularly hard to fill cleanly. I wouldn’t have even known how to spell MEGADETH and, since I am 65 years old, you would be right in guessing I don’t have much of their music on my iPhone. The clue for 31-Across was Erik’s idea also — pretty funny, I think. It was a ton of fun working with Erik, and thanks to Will and the editing team for allowing BADASS, as well as making us fine-tune the fill. I’m super pleased with the way the puzzle turned out — hope solvers enjoy it! Erik Agard: Can’t spell “Bruce Haight” without “bright”! As a solver, I’m always excited to see this multiple Orca nominee’s byline on a puzzle, so it’s an honor for me to join him for his 43rd New York Times crossword. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2018,Quiet Day at a Pittsburgh Synagogue Became a Battle to Survive,"PITTSBURGH — As gunfire shattered the prayerful morning stillness of the Tree of Life synagogue, Barry Werber was hiding in a darkened storage room. In front of him was Melvin Wax, a longtime member of the New Light Congregation whose body now lay on the floor. Then a man stepped through a swinging door into the room. Mr. Werber saw that he was carrying a long gun. “He walks in,” Mr. Werber said of the killer. “He steps over Mel’s body.” The man seemed to look around for a brief moment, but couldn’t seem to see in the darkness. He walked back out. Mr. Werber escaped with his life. But 11 others in the synagogue on Wilkins Avenue on Saturday morning did not. The massacre unfolded over about an hour in individual acts of endurance and courage — Mr. Werber holding his breath in the darkness, police officers who rushed in while the gunfire was still raging to confront the killer, congregants who put aside their terror to help one another. It ended when the gunman, identified by police as Robert Bowers, wounded and crawling on his knees, surrendered to police officers. He had “wanted all Jews to die,” he told a SWAT officer then, according to a criminal complaint filed in the case, because Jews “were committing genocide against his people.” [Read more about the shooting suspect, who frequently reposted anti-Semitic content on social media. Are you a rabbi counseling a grieving congregation? We’d like to hear from you.] The synagogue massacre on Saturday — one of the worst attacks against the Jewish community in the United States in decades — hit at the heart of one of the country’s most vital Jewish neighborhoods. And it shook a nation in the homestretch of an exhausting and bitter political season that has seen rising vitriol and occasional threats of violence. Only a few days earlier, federal law enforcement agents had been called out in multiple states to investigate a series of pipe bombs mailed to Democratic critics of President Trump. Mayor Bill Peduto called the synagogue attack the “darkest day of Pittsburgh’s history.” It began as a normal Saturday for the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, home to about one-fourth of the Jewish residents of greater Pittsburgh. As the population has aged and attendance has dwindled, three congregations — New Light, Tree of Life and Dor Hadash — have all come to call the synagogue home. The New Light congregation met in a downstairs area in what is formally called the New Light Chapel. On a typical Shabbat, about 20 people would show up to worship at New Light, said Carl Solomon, who is a member, and many of those would trickle in late. At 9:54 a.m., shortly after services started, emergency dispatchers began receiving 911 calls from the synagogue. One of the calls was from Mr. Werber. “Active shooter,” said the dispatcher. “Tree of Life synagogue. 5898 Wilkins Ave. There is an active shooter in the building. They are being attacked. There is gunfire. Caller is going to be on the third floor. One person down so far.” Mr. Werber, a 76-year-old retired information technology worker, had come to Saturday services and, as usual, Cecil and David Rosenthal, two brothers with long ties to the congregation, were just inside, greeting people and handing out prayer books. Mr. Werber noticed a table by the entrance with some wine goblets and a bottle of whiskey, presumably for a special ceremony called a bris, in one of the other congregations. Mr. Werber did not usually come on Saturday mornings, preferring Friday night and Sunday morning services, but it was the yahrzeit, the anniversary of his mother’s death, and thus a solemn occasion for him. He went down the stairs to the New Light sanctuary, where the rabbi of his congregation and two others had already gathered. There were two more members there that morning: Daniel Stein and Richard Gottfried; they were in the kitchen, making sure the lox, cream cheese, bagels and eggs were ready for the next day’s breakfast. In the sanctuary, Mr. Wax, 88, who was a fixture at New Light, stood in the front to begin the service. The rabbi was there. Suddenly, there was a loud noise. “I assumed that someone had run into that table,” Mr. Werber said, referring to the table with the wine goblets. “So I opened the door to look. And I saw the body of Cecil on the steps.” He knew immediately what had happened. So did the rabbi, who had already gone to the back of the sanctuary, where a swinging door led into a storage room about six feet across. Mr. Werber, Mr. Wax, the rabbi and Carol Black, another congregant, all hurried in. It was pitch dark inside. “I didn’t know that room too well,” Mr. Werber said. “I had been in it once, and I knew there might be a back way out of the building there in the dark. I couldn’t find it.” The rabbi did apparently find a way out, and left to seek help. Mr. Werber, feeling around in the darkness, called 911 on his cellphone and described what he was hearing — more shots, and then silence. Joseph Charney, 90, a congregant at the Tree of Life synagogue since 1955, said he was standing in front of a woman who was reading to the congregation, and next to his rabbi, when they heard what he thought was furniture falling. It was not until Mr. Bowers walked into their congregation that they understood what was happening. “As soon as I realized what it was, it was get out of there or die,” Mr. Charney said. He saw Mr. Bowers shoot four people, and he ran away quickly. “I saw a big gun — I only looked at him for a couple of seconds, and I put two and two together,” Mr. Charney said. He said he and the woman who had been reading scurried to a space on the third floor where “there are places to hide, because they are small.” He stood there with the woman, thinking of two things: “Keep your mouth shut and don’t breathe. It was very difficult.” When the first police officers arrived around 10 a.m., the gunman immediately began shooting at them. “We’re under fire, we’re under fire,” said an officer, according to a transcript of the police radio scanner traffic. “He’s got an automatic weapon, he’s firing at us from the synagogue.” Another officer reported: “We’re taking on AK-47 fire from out the front of the synagogue.” Mr. Werber was hiding in the storage room with Ms. Black and with Mr. Wax. “Mel Wax, blessed memory, couldn’t hear,” Mr. Werber said. “He had hearing aids, but you had to shout to make him hear anything. And I wasn’t about to do any shouting.” After a long pause in the gunfire, Mr. Wax pushed the door open. Three shots rang out, Mr. Werber said, and Mr. Wax’s body fell back into the room. When the gunman came in, stepping over Mr. Wax’s body, no one said a word. Ms. Black was crouched near the door. Mr. Werber’s cellphone, an old flip phone, was unlit. “If there had been any light, I would have been the center of the bull’s-eye,” he said. “I was just hoping he didn’t have a flashlight, or he just didn’t spray the back of the room for the hell of it.” Instead, he walked out. At 10:55 a.m. the SWAT team encountered Mr. Bowers, up on the third floor where he had barricaded himself. “Shots were still going off when I came out of the room,” an officer said on the scanner. “I believe he’s still alive.” Eight minutes later, officers reported talking to Mr. Bowers. “Contact with the actor,” an officer said. “Spontaneous negotiations ongoing, communications effort to get him to come out, tell him we’re not going in.” Officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect, and four police officers were wounded, three of them by bullets. “He’s been given orders to crawl out, crawl out,” an officer said. “He’s not done so yet.” At 11:08 a.m., the suspect finally surrendered, crawling toward the officers. “Suspect’s talking about, uh, all these Jews need to die,” an officer said. “The suspect keeps telling about killing Jews, he doesn’t want any of them to live.” When the police got to Mr. Werber, he went over to check Mr. Wax’s pulse. There wasn’t any. He followed the police out. Later, he learned that Mr. Stein and Mr. Gottfried had also been killed. “The three people who died are the heart of our congregation,” said Stephen Cohen, 69, a co-president of New Light. “They are the people who conducted our services, they did Torah readings, they managed the bimah. It’s a stab in the heart.” Mr. Werber and Ms. Black were taken to a police car, where they sat and listened to the drama on the police radio. After that, they were moved to a pediatric facility across the street, and afterward to the Jewish Community Center. When Mr. Werber was finally allowed to leave, he found that he was lost driving home on streets he had known his entire life. “I couldn’t find my way home,” he said. Mr. Bowers, who had no criminal history, remained under guard in the hospital Sunday morning after having surgery, authorities said. He was scheduled to make his first appearance before a federal judge on Monday at 1:30 p.m. Federal officials charged him with 29 criminal counts, included obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs — a hate crime, which can carry the death penalty. He also faces state charges. News of the massacre prompted condemnation from around the world. Pope Francis led prayers for Pittsburgh on Sunday in St. Peter’s Square, denouncing the “inhuman act of violence” and praying for an end to the “flames of hatred” that fueled it. Mr. Trump ordered flags to fly at half-staff, after returning to Washington from Illinois on Saturday night. On Sunday night, a cold rain pouring outside, thousands gathered for a standing-room-only vigil at the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh. Rabbis, ministers and other faith leaders spoke alongside officials from the city, the county, and the state of Israel. Reuven Rivlin, the president of the state of Israel, appearing by video link, led the attendees in saying a mourner’s Kaddish. Naftali Bennett, Israel’s education secretary, spoke in person about coming together and “saying no to hatred.” Mayor Peduto talked of driving anti-Semites “back to the basement on their computer and away from the open discussions and dialogues around this city, around this state, and around this country.” Mr. Werber, for his part, was not certain when he would be able to return to the synagogue he has considered an important part of his life for nearly 20 years. “It’s our home,” he said. “But to be very honest, I’m going to have trouble walking into our sanctuary. It’s not a sanctuary anymore. Literally, it’s not a sanctuary anymore.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a congregation at Tree of Life synagogue. It is the New Light Congregation, not the New Life Congregation.",The New York Times

2018,"Racial Abuse, Then a Beating, on a French Soccer Field","France’s men’s national team is the world champion, but current and former players say French soccer at the amateur level is marred by racism and discrimination. Kerfalla Sissoko and two teammates were beaten by opposing players and fans during an amateur game in May.CreditCreditPascal Mora for The New York Times STRASBOURG, France — When France won soccer’s World Cup in July, millions of fans crowded the streets and cheered as star players like Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappé were honored at the presidential palace. As in 1998, when a similarly multicultural team delivered France’s first world title, commentators quickly hailed the triumph of a “new” and more united France, one that would become more open to diversity, at least in sports. But Kerfalla Sissoko had more troubling thoughts on his mind. A month before the World Cup, Sissoko, 25, an amateur soccer player from Guinea, had been brutally attacked after a fight broke out during a league match near the northeastern city of Strasbourg. Sissoko and several black teammates said later that rival players and fans had directed racist insults at them during the game, but the spark of the brawl hardly mattered to him as he ran for his life. Cornered as he tried to leave the field, Sissoko was threatened by rival supporters — including one holding a knife — and beaten by players and fans, who broke his cheekbone. Then league officials suspended him for 10 games for provoking the melee. “I was so afraid and so disgusted, that I felt like I would never play soccer again,” Sissoko said. What happened to Sissoko in May, far from the glittering Stade de France, where the many black players on the French national team recently celebrated its triumph and where it will face Germany on Tuesday, has shined a light on the racism and discrimination that still mar French soccer at the amateur level, critics say. A survey of 300 amateur sports clubs published in March by the antiracism organization Licra highlighted 74 cases of racism, but the study’s authors acknowledged that the problem had become so common that episodes are often not reported. Incidents that do make the news — the attack on Sissoko and his teammates; an assault on three black players outside a nightclub in Corsica in September; another case of racial insults from supporters in May 2017, in St.-Pierre d’Oléron, in western France — show that it remains a national issue. Racism in soccer is not only a French problem. Racist insults against black players are still routine in many European leagues. In Germany, the federation has tried to contain accusations of discrimination after Mesut Ozil, who is of Turkish origin, resigned from the national team this summer, saying, “I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose.” But in France, the victory at the World Cup by a multicultural team of Frenchmen — white, black, Muslim — has failed to persuade many anti-discrimination advocates that longstanding and deeply contentious issues like race and nationality have been resolved. “It’s very complicated to bring up the issue of racism in the French society, because in France we pretend to be blind to colors,” said Lilian Thuram, a defender on France’s 1998 World Cup championship team who has closely followed Sissoko’s case. Critics like Thuram argue that while France’s national and professional teams have made progress in preventing or punishing racism in soccer, local authorities often refuse to recognize the problem or deal with it effectively when problems arise. Officials from the local league in which Sissoko’s assault occurred, for example, rejected not only the racial abuse claims of Sissoko and his teammates but also the premise that the violence had been motivated by race at all. William Gasparini, a sociology professor at the University of Strasbourg who studies discrimination and sports, said there was a big gap between the ways race is handled at the professional level and in the lower levels of amateur soccer. “Professional clubs or national teams may now be more aware of racism issues than in the past, but that is the stage, the visible part,” he said. He added, referring to a mafia-style code of silence, “In amateur soccer throughout France, there is an omertà: Clubs are more reluctant to address racism or discrimination.” For Thuram, that can be explained by a lack of diversity: The boards of most of France’s soccer institutions, he said, are still populated largely by white men. Four of the 14 members of the French soccer federation’s executive committee are women, and only one member is nonwhite. Its amateur equivalent, an association that oversees hundreds of clubs and dozens of leagues across the country, is governed by a board on which all 12 members are white. Sissoko was assaulted during the first half of a game in Mackenheim, a village of 800 residents. Sissoko and two of his black A.S. Benfeld teammates said that several Mackenheim supporters and players had targeted them with racial slurs. As the match grew more tense shortly before halftime, a disagreement on the field turned into a fight. Mackenheim players assaulted the black players, according to spectators and Sissoko’s teammates. Moudi Laouali, 27, a Benfeld player from Niger, was punched in the face and was later beaten as he lay on the field. When Sissoko tried to reach the relative safety of the locker room, he said, Mackenheim fans who had invaded the field blocked his way. He said one of them, holding a kitchen knife, told him, “We are not done with you.” Pushed to the ground and kicked in the face and chest, he eventually lost consciousness. “That day, I saw myself dying on the pitch,” Sissoko said. Yet the referee ruled that Sissoko, a 6-foot midfielder, had provoked the fight and gave him the first red card of his career as he lay unconscious on the field. “That is the world of soccer for people of color: You have to be three times better than your adversaries, or fight,” said Francis Mante, 39, a referee and former amateur player in the Strasbourg area. Mante, who is from Ghana, arrived in France in 1998. “We call it the beautiful game,” he added, “but it’s set up in a very cruel world.” Laouali, as well as two players from Mackenheim, received the same 10-game ban that Sissoko received. The league also fined Mackenheim 500 euros, or about $575, for failing to control its fans, but its ruling did not address the players’ accusations of racism, arguing that only the black players had reported hearing the racist insults. “Whenever black people say they face racism, we question their legitimacy, we disqualify their claims,” said Thuram, who now heads the Lilian Thuram Foundation, an antiracism organization. He argued that a similar form of colorblindness had been on display after France’s victory in the World Cup, when many refused to acknowledge that the team’s diversity partly explained its success. “In the U.S., people highlighted the fact that there were many black players of African origin in the French team,” Thuram said. “And in France, people say, ‘No, there are only French.’” What unfolded during that violent game in May, though, on a field squeezed between cornfields and a pine forest, shocked the entire soccer community in eastern France. With more than 210,000 registered players, the Great East League is one of the country’s biggest amateur organizations, one known for its ethnic and religious diversity — some clubs are made up exclusively of Turkish, Portuguese or Spanish players — but also for instances of violence and racism. A few days before Sissoko was beaten in May, for example, Mante, the referee from Ghana, was walking to his car with his family after a game between two small clubs when he heard the president of one of the teams tell him to “go eat your banana.” The president received a 10-month suspension, and his club was fined €100 for the insult but refused to acknowledge that it was racist. “The federation sanctions those who insult referees, even if it’s a ridiculous sanction,” Mante said. “But if you are victim of racism as a player, you barely have a chance.” Although the two Mackenheim players who received suspensions for the brawl in May acknowledged that the violence was unacceptable, they denied that racist or xenophobic feelings had motivated their acts, arguing that they were of Turkish origin and thus could not be racist toward black people. Both declined to speak on the record, though, citing fear of reprisals. “Yes, there is some racism in Mackenheim,” said Victor Gallin, 22, a defender for the team that bears the town’s name. “But our players have never been racist. Never.” But Cynan Keles, 18, an A.S. Benfeld player of Turkish heritage, suggested that the black players on his team had been targeted specifically because of their skin color. “Call it the way you want, but the Turkish players of Mackenheim would have never dared touch us, the other Turks,” he said. Sissoko filed a complaint with the police in May, and the results of the investigation are expected to be made public by the end of October. Anne Hussenet, the prosecutor in charge of the case, said the police still had to determine what had precipitated the violence, which she said had been caused in part by the tensions during the game and also, potentially, “by another kind of motives.” In Strasbourg, the regional federation has implemented measures to fight intolerance, including one in which captains of opposing teams meet to socialize ahead of matches that bear some risk of violence or tension. In such games, the federation can also appoint additional delegates to support the referee. Sissoko, meanwhile, was recently found to have severe post-traumatic stress disorder; he said he still wakes up from nightmares months after the beating. He played with A.S. Benfeld for the first time since the incident on a recent Sunday and said that while he was happy to be back on a field, he worried about physical contact with other players. “I feel like I’m not 100 percent present on the pitch, and as soon as I can pass the ball, I get rid of it,” he said after the game. With the help of local organizations, he is hoping to put his experience to use by creating a statement against racism and intolerance that amateur clubs in the region will have to sign. “What happened cannot happen again here,” Sissoko said. “Never.”",The New York Times
2018,Racist Rant on Ryanair Flight Prompts Investigation by British Police,"The British police say they are investigating a white man who berated a black woman with racist comments on a Ryanair plane last week, adding that they plan to turn over their findings to the Spanish authorities. The police in Essex, a county in southeast England, said on Tuesday that they had identified both passengers in the “racially aggravated incident,” which occurred on Friday while the airplane was still on the tarmac in Barcelona. A video of the tirade, in which the British man called the woman a “stupid, ugly cow” and an “ugly black bastard,” was recorded by a fellow passenger and has been viewed millions of times since it was posted online. Flight attendants forced the woman, not the man, to move, and Ryanair’s handling of the episode was intensely criticized, with people urging a boycott of the Dublin-based budget airline and British lawmakers calling for action. Because Ryanair is an Irish company and the incident happened on the ground in Spain, the man most likely could not be prosecuted in Britain, said Karl Turner, a British lawmaker who speaks for the Labour Party on transportation. In Spain, the state agency responsible for air safety said that it could penalize the passenger if its investigation into his behavior concluded that it was that of a “conflictive passenger.” The Essex Police said on Facebook on Tuesday, “Since the report was made to us, our officers have identified both parties involved and are progressing a number of enquiries,” adding that they learned of the video on Sunday. “There are agreed national protocols to follow when incidents are reported to have happened in another country,” the police said. “As such, we will be conducting an investigation to submit to the Spanish authorities in due course.” A spokeswoman for the police, reached by telephone on Wednesday, said that the inquiry was continuing and that no arrests had been made. The spokeswoman, who said she was not authorized to be quoted by name, declined to confirm the name of the man, whom the BBC and other British news outlets have identified. The man started ranting at the woman, Delsie Gayle, while he was in the aisle, after he tried to get past her to sit by the window. Ms. Gayle, who has arthritis, apparently did not get up as quickly as he wanted, so he started to point his finger in her face, and she told him to stop, she said in an interview with ITV News on Monday. The video by the fellow passenger, David Lawrence, captures the moments when the man, seated near a window, berated and bullied the woman, ordering her to move. In addition to the insults, he told her not to speak to him in a “foreign language,” though Ms. Gayle, who was born in Jamaica, was speaking English. “I feel very low,” she said in the interview. “He paid a fare to go on holiday, I’ve paid mine, so why does he abuse me for that due to the color of my skin?” Once the flight attendants moved the woman, the plane eventually took off from Barcelona, and the man apparently did not face any immediate consequences. Mayor Ada Colau of Barcelona said on Facebook on Tuesday that the city would take legal action. “Above all, we want to express our solidarity with the victim and our repudiation, not just of the racist, shameless, rude man that perpetrated this act of violence and hate, but also of the company for making the woman move seats, rather than the person guilty of the verbal attack, who deserved to be removed from the plane and taken straight to a police station,” she said. “As a city we’re going to take this seriously, initiate legal action and present the video as proof,” Ms. Colau said. “Not just so that this racist, hate-filled man is punished, but also to force the company to change its procedures in such cases and support victims rather than aggressors.” The airline said it had turned over the video to the police in Essex, who are in charge of the region around London Stansted Airport, where the flight landed. But the company, which has faced calls for a boycott, has not commented further. On Wednesday, a reporter for The Daily Mirror published a video on Twitter of the police entering Chinn Brook House, a retirement home in Birmingham where the man is believed to live. Calls to the center on Wednesday were not answered. An official at Optivo, the British housing provider for the man at the home, did not immediately return a request for comment. News reports said the man had refused to speak to reporters outside the center.",The New York Times
2018,"Rae Carruth, N.F.L. Player Who Conspired to Kill Girlfriend, Is Out of Prison","Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panthers receiver who was convicted of conspiring to kill his pregnant girlfriend, was released from prison on Monday after 18 years 11 months. Mr. Carruth, now 44, was sentenced to 18 to 24 years in prison in 2001 after being convicted of offering $5,000 to another man to kill his pregnant girlfriend, Cherica L. Adams, in North Carolina in 1999. Ms. Adams was shot and killed in a drive-by attack by the man, Van Brett Watkins. Mr. Carruth was on hand, the police said, and used his car to block Ms. Adams’s car and facilitate the shooting. He skipped bail after his arrest and was eventually found hiding in a car trunk in a Best Western parking lot in Tennessee. Mr. Carruth was acquitted of first-degree murder, which could have brought a life sentence or the death penalty. Ms. Adams was eight months pregnant when she was shot. Prosecutors said Mr. Carruth had been motivated by not wanting to pay child support. The fetus survived the shooting and was delivered via an emergency cesarean section, 10 weeks premature. The child, Chancellor, is now 18. He has brain damage and cerebral palsy stemming from injuries sustained in the shooting. Mr. Watkins remains in prison on a minimum 40-year term. “I’m grateful to be ending this and getting out of here, but at the same time I have to admit I am ashamed and embarrassed to have even been associated with this crime,” Mr. Carruth told WSOC-TV in Charlotte before his release. Referring to Saundra Adams, Cherica’s mother, who has raised Chancellor, he said: “I’ve apologized to Ms. Adams for the loss of her daughter and taken responsibility for what happened. I’d love the opportunity to make things right with her and Chancellor.” “I just truly want to be forgiven,” he added. “He will never have his mother in his life. Right or wrong, he still has the opportunity to have me in his life.” Mr. Carruth did not comment to reporters when he left prison on Monday morning. “I want him to come to repentance,” Ms. Adams told The Charlotte Observer, adding: “Rae would never come back here and do anything, but that doesn’t mean he wouldn’t send someone. So I am a little anxious.” Mr. Carruth was a first-round pick out of the University of Colorado, then spent three seasons with the Panthers. As a rookie he caught four touchdown passes, but he was plagued by injuries his next two seasons. He was released from Sampson Correctional Institution in Clinton, N.C.",The New York Times
2018,Rafael Lozano-Hemmer Is a Crowd Pleaser. He’s Also Obsessed With Death.,"Can an artist be a creator of entertaining, technologically inspired, interactive creations that people line up to try, and be, at the same time, a somewhat macabre intellectual with a penchant for social criticism? Based on the career of the Montreal-based, Mexico City-born artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, the answer is yes. Contradictions are built into the man and the work. Mr. Lozano-Hemmer, 50, is an upbeat, articulate sort whose whole worldview is based on connecting people via science and technology. He’s quick with a smart observation, a follow-up email and a polite social inquiry. But he also created “Vicious Circular Breathing” (2013), a sealed room filled with human exhalations. Inviting onlookers to enter it and breathe, it includes warnings about asphyxiation, panic and contagion. And he refuses to use it himself. “It’s absolutely disgusting,” Mr. Lozano-Hemmer said recently, not something frequently heard from, say, Picasso about his latest canvas. The many sides of the artist will get their widest American exposure with “Rafael Lozano-Hemmer: Pulse,” at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, in Washington, from Thursday through April 28. The show is a greatest-hits of sorts, with just three supersize works, all with “Pulse” in the title. Mr. Lozano-Hemmer works grandly: The exhibition takes over the whole second floor of the museum. “They are totally immersive, and I appreciate being able to work on this scale,” he said in an interview in the East Village over the summer, on one of his frequent trips to New York from Montreal. All three of the works require participation to function: They are powered by the visitors. “If nobody shows up at the Hirshhorn, there’s no show,” Mr. Lozano-Hemmer added. Based on the interest in his previous exhibitions, that’s not likely to be a problem. “Pulse Index” (2010) records visitors’ fingerprints and heart rates, displaying the data of the last 765 participants on a large wall. It also has images of their fingers — creating a slightly creepy effect — and graphics that animate the biometric information. “Pulse Tank” (2008) converts audience heart rates into waves in a water tank, which then set off a light show, and “Pulse Room” (2006) animates about 300 light bulbs with the same information, collected via a sensor. Mr. Lozano-Hemmer’s talent is making philosophical ideas somehow literal — the abstract becomes weirdly real, or real with a surreal edge. Museums, galleries and biennials have flocked to work with him for at least a decade, given that his projects have two levels of appeal: a gee-whiz, hands-on side that brings people in the door, and then a deeper, often darker meaning that can be apprehended by those who choose to linger. “The idea of being in D.C. and making a project with biometrics — measuring the presence of people and how they are different from each other — seems very relevant now,” Mr. Lozano-Hemmer said. In the era of “identity control,” he added, “these platforms are for connection and community.” Surveillance has been an interest of Mr. Lozano-Hemmer’s for decades. In one of his early works, “Vectorial Elevation” (1999), each random internet user could create a light sculpture by controlling 18 searchlights trained on the Zócalo, Mexico City’s central square. The theme of who is watching us, and how and why we allow it, is shared by many top artists, notably Trevor Paglen, who won a MacArthur Fellowship last year. Mr. Paglen’s exhibition “Sites Unseen,” at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, is concurrently on view just a few blocks away from the Hirshhorn, creating interesting echoes in the city that is the seat of American government. Melissa Chiu, the Hirshhorn’s director, said that Mr. Lozano-Hemmer had “intellectual depth, and makes very complex ideas tangible and understandable.” “That’s a great gift,” she added. Ms. Chiu, who has led the institution since 2014, isn’t shying away from the political implications of the work, either. “Here we are on the National Mall, with the moniker of being the national museum of modern art,” Ms. Chiu said. “The role of artists in society is to challenge us.” Most museums have been looking for ways to bring in younger audiences, and Mr. Lozano-Hemmer’s work seems tailor-made to further that goal. “You can approach it without any predetermined knowledge of art,” Ms. Chiu said. “And it’s true that a younger demographic leans into works where they have a role to play.” Because of its size and complexity, Mr. Lozano-Hemmer’s art isn’t easy to collect, but that has not deterred Ella Cisneros-Fontanals, a Miami-based arts patron. She bought her first work by him about 15 years ago and has accumulated around 10 of them, including the multimedia piece “The Year’s Midnight” (2011). She even put Mr. Lozano-Hemmer on the board of her art foundation. “He opens worlds for us that we wouldn’t know about,” Ms. Cisneros-Fontanals said. She added that her favorite thing was to “watch other people looking at his work and interacting with it.” Mr. Lozano-Hemmer grew up in a world of performance and boundary-pushing. His parents owned the Mexico City nightclub Los Infernos. “They were pioneers in transvestite shows,” he recalled. An interest in science and technology led him to study chemistry at Concordia University in Montreal, and, after a long stint living in Madrid, he eventually settled back in Canada. His far-flung biography may help explain why his art has appeal all over the world. This year he has had solo exhibitions in Seoul, South Korea, and in Switzerland, in addition to those in the United States, Mexico and Canada. But “solo” is in some ways a mischaracterization for Mr. Lozano-Hemmer’s work because his Montreal studio has 14 co-workers. “It’s a good place, full of nerds,” he said, laughing. Half of them are engineers and programmers with an artistic bent, he said; the other half are artists and designers who also like technology. “And I’m the director, but I credit them, as you would credit your composer and your lighting designer on a film,” he said. Categorizing the studio’s output is tricky, but it’s the kind of topic the artist relishes. “I work with technology, but I really detest the term ‘new media’ because I’m fully aware of experimentation in these fields that goes back 100 years,” Mr. Lozano-Hemmer said, citing the pioneering work of the Argentine artist and writer Marta Minujín, who was an early maker of Conceptual work with an interactive bent. “To pretend what we’re doing is new is disingenuous.” He cited a statistic that the average person spent at least eight hours a day in front of some kind of screen. “Working with technology is normal, it’s natural,” he said. “If you’re living on this planet, and you want to reflect on what the concerns are, then you have to work with technology. It’s not something optional.” From the beginning of his career, Mr. Lozano-Hemmer has been extremely prolific. Now he’s at work on securing funding for “Border Tuner,” a light-and-sound installation that will connect Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and El Paso. That level of output, and the heady rush of his speech as he makes his points, suggests that he hears the clock ticking. “Ultimately, all art that interests me is all about death,” he said. “Montaigne said that to philosophize is to learn how to die. I think art does the same. Why do we make art? Well, because we are concerned that we have a finite amount of time.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article and an accompanying picture caption misstated the name of the museum in Washington where Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s work will be on view. It is the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, not the Hirshhorn Museum and Culture Garden. The article also described imprecisely the scale of the show. It is the exhibition that takes over the second floor of the museum, not just one of the three supersize works. Opinion",The New York Times
2018,Raiders Trade Amari Cooper to the Cowboys,"DALLAS — The Dallas Cowboys made a bold move for the present on Monday, trading a first-round pick for Oakland receiver Amari Cooper in Raiders Coach Jon Gruden’s latest play for the future. The Cowboys gave up their top pick in the next draft in hopes of giving quarterback Dak Prescott another weapon just a few months after releasing Dez Bryant, the franchise’s touchdown-catch leader, in a cost-cutting move. Dallas (3-4) has struggled to score points while losing all four of its road games, including a 20-17 loss Sunday at Washington. Cowboys receivers have not made many big plays in their first season without Bryant and the retired tight end Jason Witten, the club leader in catches. The Cowboys decided Bryant was not worth $12.5 million in 2018 after three subpar seasons since he signed a big contract following his only All-Pro year in 2014. Raiders General Manager Reggie McKenzie said Stephen Jones, the Cowboys’ executive vice president of personnel, had called last week to say he would check in on Cooper on Monday and offered the first-round pick that the Raiders were holding out for before making a deal. Cooper was the fourth overall draft pick by the Raiders out of Alabama three years ago. He started his career with consecutive 1,000-yard seasons and had two 100-yard games this year but has had just two targets and one catch since the second of those games. Cooper, who is 24 — five years younger than Bryant — was placed in the concussion protocol after leaving Oakland’s last game against Seattle on Oct. 14. Dallas receivers have just one 100-yard game combined through seven games, by Cole Beasley in a Week 6 victory over Jacksonville. The Cowboys are going into their bye week, and the Raiders are returning from their break to face Indianapolis at home Sunday. For Gruden, dealing his most accomplished receiver does not compare to the preseason trade that sent the two-time All-Pro pass rusher Khalil Mack to Chicago. But it is another example of the Raiders (1-5) looking to the future. Oakland figures to have a good shot at the No. 1 overall pick in 2019 and now has three first-rounders with the Cooper trade. “This is where we get a great opportunity to build,” McKenzie said. “We’ve got pieces now, but we can really rebuild on what we have. With this group, the coaches that I’ve got here, knowing where we’re heading schematically on both sides of the ball and special teams, we’re going to build this thing. We’ve got the ammunition to build this thing really well.” Cooper is the third receiver who has started his career with back-to-back seasons with 1,000 yards receiving and 70 catches, following Odell Beckham Jr. and Marques Colston, but he has been unable to build on that success the past two years. He has just 70 catches for 960 yards since the start of 2016 as his inconsistency has become a bigger problem. Cooper has been held under 30 yards receiving in 13 of his last 26 games. Cooper has 3,183 yards and 19 touchdowns in three-plus seasons. The Raiders have now dealt two key pieces away from their 12-win 2016 team and appear to be in rebuilding mode now. “It’s disappointing,” McKenzie said. “Real disappointing. It was starting to get that way last year when we somewhat took a nose dive, but I understand the N.F.L., the system will not allow you to keep them all.” This is not the first time Jerry Jones, the Cowboys’ owner and general manager, has made a big trade for a former top-10 pick at receiver, and the other two attempts did not go well. In 2000, Jones sent two first-round picks to Seattle for Joey Galloway before the first of three straight 5-11 seasons. Galloway, drafted eighth over all by the Seahawks in 1995, did not have a 1,000-yard season in four years with the Cowboys. About this time 10 years ago, the Cowboys got Roy Williams from Detroit for three draft picks, including a first-rounder. His first full season with Dallas was his best, with 596 yards receiving and seven touchdowns. The Cowboys made the playoffs once in two-plus years with Williams, in 2009, when they won their first postseason game since the last of five Super Bowl victories following the 1995 season. Williams was drafted seventh over all by the Lions in 2004.",The New York Times
2018,Rangers Lose the Lead Four Times and the Game to the Hurricanes,"N.H.L. Roundup Warren Foegele had two goals and an assist, Andrei Svechnikov got his first career goal to snap tie midway through the third period, and the host Carolina Hurricanes rallied to beat the Rangers, 8-5, Sunday. Svechnikov, the No. 2 overall pick in June’s draft, deflected Justin Faulk’s shot in front of the net with 9 minutes 16 seconds remaining to break a 5-5 tie and give the Hurricanes their first lead. Foegele followed with his second goal 47 seconds later and Teuvo Teravainen added an empty-netter to secure Carolina’s first home win under their new coach, Rod Brind’Amour. “I waited for this my whole life,” said the 18-year-old Svechnikov, who became the first N.H.L. player born in the 2000s to score a goal. Jordan Martinook, Jordan Staal, Micheal Ferland, Lucas Wallmark and Teuvo Teravainen also scored for the Hurricanes. The Rangers had leads of 2-0, 3-2, 4-3 and 5-4 and failed to hold each of them. Jimmy Vesey and Chris Kreider each scored twice and Pavel Buchnevich added a goal for the Rangers, who remains winless in three games under their new coach, David Quinn. “Defensively, we looked like we had never gone over these coverages or anything we had been working on,” Quinn said. “We had a hard time handling success tonight. When we got up, we didn’t pay attention to detail in the same situation.” Petr Mrazek made 19 saves for the Hurricanes, and Alexandar Georgiev had 32 for the Rangers. The teams combined for four goals in each of the first two periods and were tied at 4-4 heading to the third. Vesey and Kreider scored on the Rangers’ first two shots of the game, only to have the Hurricanes battle back. Foegele and Martinook scored to pull the Hurricanes to 2-2 by the end of the first. Vesey again opened the scoring with a quick goal in the second, and again Carolina responded. Right after the Hurricanes killed off a four-on-three power play, Staal finished off a breakaway with a wrist shot over Georgiev’s blocker. Buchnevich gave the Rangers the lead once again in the second when he stuffed home a rebound on a power play, but a critical mistake by Georgiev allowed the Hurricanes to tie it back up. As the clock moved under a minute, he left his crease to try to clear a puck out of the corner. His attempt went right to the point to Ferland, who flipped a wrister over Georgiev’s shoulder as he raced back to his net, making it 4-4 with 31 seconds left in the second period. It was more of the same in the third. Kreider gave the Rangers the lead again, only to have Wallmark tie it 35 seconds later. This time though, the Hurricanes charged ahead, taking their first lead on Svechnikov’s goal and piling it on from there. TAVARES HAS HAT TRICK John Tavares scored three goals for the Toronto Maple Leafs in a 7-6 overtime victory against the host Chicago Blackhawks. Tavares, who came from the Islanders as a free agent, scored twice in the second period and once in the third. He has four goals in the first three games. GOALIES ARE SIDELINED The Florida Panthers put goaltender Roberto Luongo on injured reserve, one day after a right knee injury knocked him out of his team’s season-opening loss at Tampa Bay. He is expected to be out at least a week. Kings goalie Jonathan Quick, with a lower-body injury, was also put on injured reserve. The team did not say how long he would be out. THORNTON OUT The San Jose Sharks said that forward Joe Thornton, 39, would not return until at least next Sunday after experiencing swelling in his surgically repaired right knee.

2018,Rangers Lose to Kings on Alec Martinez’s Goal With 55 Seconds Left,"N.H.L. Roundup Alec Martinez scored with 55 seconds remaining, and the host Los Angeles Kings stopped a six-game skid with a 4-3 win over the Rangers on Sunday. Martinez brought the puck from behind the net into the offensive zone and fired a wrist shot through the legs of Brendan Smith and past goaltender Henrik Lundqvist for his first goal of the season. The winner, while of course not as big as Martinez’s goal that won the 2014 Stanley Cup, did provide him major relief. “Yeah, when the buzzer sounds, it was obviously a good feeling,” Martinez said. “We haven’t felt that in a while. That said, we enjoy it tonight and tomorrow it’s back to work.” Ilya Kovalchuk had a goal and an assist, Trevor Lewis scored and Jack Campbell made 22 saves in place of the injured Jonathan Quick for the Kings, who rallied from a 2-0 deficit. Dustin Brown, making his season debut after breaking a finger in Los Angeles’s final preseason game, also scored. Vladislav Namestnikov and Tony DeAngelo each had a goal and an assist and Ryan Spooner also scored for the Rangers, who are winless in five road games. Lundqvist made 36 saves. The Rangers have not won away from home this season, having been outscored by 23-13 in road games and having allowed at least three goals in each such game. The frustration was evident after another self-inflicted mistake, for too many men on the ice, resulted in Kovalchuk’s power-play goal. “You just have to stop beating yourself,” Coach David Quinn said. “It’s hard enough in this league to beat teams when you’re not beating yourself. We helped them win tonight, and that’s got to stop. That’s on me, and we’re going to keep at it.” Spooner tied the game at 3-3 with 4 minutes 44 seconds remaining after Lewis had put the Kings ahead about five minutes earlier, ending a 410-minute stretch during which the Kings had failed to hold a lead. The Rangers went ahead by 2-0 in the second period when Campbell accidentally deflected DeAngelo’s centering pass into his own net with his skate. Los Angeles tied it on power-play goals a little less than three minutes apart from Brown and Kovalchuk. Namestnikov gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead at 11:11 of the first period. Namestnikov beat Campbell on a wrist shot over his right shoulder, but Lewis checked the Rangers forward into the goalie as the puck went into the net. The goal was upheld after a video review and a challenge by the Kings for goalie interference. Quick is day to day because of a lower-body injury, the team said. The injury is not believed to be related to a lower-body injury Quick sustained in practice on Oct. 6, which caused him to miss five games. ISLANDERS 2, HURRICANES 1 Anders Lee had a goal and an assist, and the Islanders won at Carolina. Ryan Pulock scored the go-ahead goal late in the second period, and Josh Bailey had two assists for the Islanders, who have earned points in three straight games. Playing eight of their first 11 games under the new coach Barry Trotz on the road, they have won two in a row for the first time. “Guys have bought in right from the start,” Pulock said, “but hesitation at times — maybe being unsure of certain situations, and these last few games here, you start to see that it’s more natural to guys and guys are in the right spots.” Teuvo Teravainen scored for Carolina, and Sebastian Aho matched two club records with an assist — giving him points and assists in all 11 games this season, the longest active streak in the league. Thomas Greiss, who stopped 90 of the 91 shots he faced in his last two games against Carolina, made 38 saves while earning his first victory since a 2-1 win in the opener at Carolina on Oct. 4 and his fifth straight victory against the Hurricanes dating to March 2017. Pulock’s go-ahead goal came with 5:25 left in the second with a turnaround slap shot between the circles off a smooth pass from Lee, who skated along the boards. Lee put the Islanders ahead, 1-0 at 3:13 of the first — and nine seconds into a hooking minor on Jordan Staal — when he scored off a pass from Bailey.",The New York Times
2018,"Rangers Top Sharks in Overtime, Giving New Coach First Win","N.H.L. Roundup Brady Skjei buried a wrist shot 37 seconds into overtime and the host Rangers beat the San Jose Sharks, 3-2, on Thursday night for Coach David Quinn’s first career victory. The Rangers’ Brendan Smith tied it at 2-2 with 2 minutes 39 seconds remaining in the third with a one-timer from the slot. Pavel Buchnevich set it up with a backhand pass from behind the net. Henrik Lundqvist stopped 41 shots, and Brett Howden also scored for the Rangers. Aaron Dell made 24 saves and Brent Burns had two assists for the Sharks. Marcus Sorensen and Joonas Donskoi scored in San Jose’s third stop of a four-game trip. Quinn was hired away from Boston University in May. The Rangers had dropped his first three games in his first season as an N.H.L. head coach. Howden, a rookie, had a highlight-reel goal to even the score at 1-1 at 13:52 of the opening period when he put the puck between his legs and then Dell’s legs. Howden moved up the depth chart before the game and skated alongside Chris Kreider and Mats Zuccarello. The Rangers acquired Howden from the Tampa Bay Lightning at last year’s trade deadline as part of a package for defenseman Ryan McDonagh. The Sharks opened the scoring when Sorenson got his first of the season. While San Jose was skating shorthanded, Sorenson performed a nifty move and snapped a shot past Lundqvist’s glove at 4:31 of the first period. Burns helped the Sharks take a 2-1 lead at 4:59 of the second when he cleared the puck from his own end, setting up an odd-man rush. Antti Suomela delivered a perfect cross-ice pass to set up a tap-in for Donskoi. DEVILS 6, CAPITALS 0 Kyle Palmieri scored twice and Keith Kinkaid made 21 saves as the Devils celebrated their home opener with a rout of Washington, the defending Stanley Cup champion. Marcus Johansson, Blake Coleman, Jean-Sebastien Dea and Brian Boyle also scored for the Devils, who were playing only their second game, after defeating Edmonton in Sweden. IWashington was 14-1-2 in the previous 17 meetings. Pheonix Copley stopped 30 shots in his Capitals debut. The Devils’ defense did an outstanding job stifling the Capitals, who had 18 goals in the first three games. Palmieri scored twice in the first period to give the Devils to a 2-0 lead. The Devils had the better jump at the start, outshooting the Capitals by 13-6 over the first 20 minutes. Washington, playing back-to-back after an emotional 5-2 win over Vegas on Wednesday in a rematch of the Stanley Cup final, started a step slow, and the Devils capitalized. Palmieri put the Devils on the board at 7:02 on a shot that glanced off his skate in a goal-mouth scramble. His second goal was a power-play drive from the top of the right circle at 18:33. That gave Palmieri four goals in his first four periods of the season. It was also the 16th time he has scored at least two goals in a game.",The New York Times
2018,"Rangers, Behind 2 Goals Each From Zibanejad and Zuccarello, Top Panthers","Rangers 5, Panthers 2 Mats Zuccarello and Mika Zibanejad each scored twice and the Rangers snapped a two-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the Florida Panthers on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. Kevin Hayes also scored, Zibanejad and Neal Pionk added two assists each, and Alexandar Georgiev made 36 saves for the Rangers (3-5-1) in their first win in regulation this season. “I’m not saying we played great tonight, but find a way to win,” the first-year Rangers coach David Quinn said. “That’s what you have to do. You are not going to have 82 great nights. You got to find ways to win when you are not on your ‘A’ game.” Vincent Trocheck and Mike Hoffman each scored their third goals of the season, and Jonathan Huberdeau had two assists for the Panthers, who fell to 1-3-3 despite holding the lead in each game. Georgiev earned his first win of the season in his second appearance. He earned the backup job with an impressive 11-game run at the finish of the 2017-18 season. Michael Hutchinson stopped 15 shots in his fourth game for Florida. The Rangers had strong special-teams play, getting two power-play goals and a short-handed goal. The Panthers outshot the Rangers, 14-5, in the opening period and took a 1-0 lead when Trocheck’s shot sailed past Georgiev at 18 minutes 15 seconds. The Rangers stormed back with three straight goals in the second. Zibanejad scored his first of the game with a pretty wraparound while his team was killing a penalty for too many men on the ice at 3:10. Adam McQuaid picked up the assist. “We came out hungrier, making smart plays and helping each other out,” Zuccarello said. He benefited from a fortunate bounce as his shot deflected off Panthers defenseman Michael Matheson’s legs and into the goal at 11:36. Pionk registered the first of his two assists and extended his points streak to three games. At 16:08 of the second period, Zibanejad struck again with a wrist shot that beat Hutchinson on the short side, giving the Rangers a 3-1 advantage. Zibanejad became the first Rangers player to record a short-handed and power-play goal in the same period since Brandon Dubinsky in April 2009. Pionk and Chris Kreider had assists. Zuccarello recorded his second goal of the game and the season at 1:27 of the third period. Zibanejad picked up his second assist. James Reimer replaced Hutchinson after that goal. The Panthers’ No. 1 goaltender, Roberto Luongo, has been sidelined since opening night with a knee injury. Hoffman scored his third of the season with a wraparound at 10:37 of the third.

2018,Rapper 6ix9ine Sentenced to Probation in Sex Video Case,"Saying that the rapper Daniel Hernandez had “engaged in acts of unsolicited generosity” and “expressed genuine remorse for his actions,” a justice on Friday spared him from prison in connection with sexually explicit videos he made with an underage girl. Instead the justice, Felicia Mennin of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, sentenced Mr. Hernandez, who performs as Tekashi69 or 6ix9ine, to four years of probation and 1,000 hours of community service. In 2015, Mr. Hernandez admitted to taking part in making and disseminating the videos, which featured a 13-year-old girl having sex. (A man who had sex with the girl in the videos went to prison.) He received probation as part of a plea agreement, but prosecutors contended he had violated the agreement with two subsequent arrests. They had asked Justice Mennin to send him to prison for one to three years. Mr. Hernandez, 22, with his long purple, orange and yellow hair and prominent face tattoos, is among the most recognizable of rappers. One of his singles, “Fefe,” recorded with Nicki Minaj, peaked at No. 3 on Billboard Hot 100 chart. Collectively his songs have been viewed hundreds of millions of times on YouTube. He has also become known for feuds with other rappers, including YG and Chief Keef. Before his sentencing Mr. Hernandez, wearing a gray suit and a blue tie with orange stripes, addressed the court, listing occasions on which he had given to the needy and seeking to draw a distinction between himself and the profane, rule-breaking image he cultivated as a rapper. “I am Daniel Hernandez,” he said. “To the court I’m Tekashi69.” Prosecutors argued that the two were not so distinct. Mr. Hernandez was charged with misdemeanor assault in Houston this year after a teenager told the police that Mr. Hernandez had grabbed him by the neck and began yelling at him to erase a video he had recorded. He also was arrested in May in Brooklyn on a charge of driving with a suspended license. The police said that he injured an officer’s hand while in custody, so he was also charged with obstructing governmental administration and assault. That case and the Houston case are pending. Prosecutors sent a blistering memorandum to Justice Mennin saying that Mr. Hernandez had been given “every chance to succeed” but had failed to mature into the law-abiding adult that the plea agreement had anticipated. “He has instead been arrested multiple times for crimes he committed this year,” the memorandum said. “Defendant has exacerbated his own violent conduct by using his public platform and significant following to provoke and promote incidents of gun violence.” The memorandum went on to say that Mr. Hernandez had acknowledged being a member of the 9 Trey Bloods, a violent gang, and had used online “trolling” to increase record sales and “to start feuds or ‘beefs’ with other recording artists throughout the country.” For instance, prosecutors wrote, after a boxing match in April at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, Mr. Hernandez and his entourage got into an argument with another rapper, Casanova. An associate of Mr. Hernandez then removed a gun from his shoe and fired a shot, the memorandum said. The memorandum also noted that Mr. Hernandez had been the victim of a violent robbery at gunpoint in July, but that after he gave an initial interview to detectives, he refused to assist their investigation. He missed a court appearance on July 25, saying he was suffering the effects of a concussion from the robbery. “Despite this assertion, defendant attended nightclubs every night from July 23 through July 25,” prosecutors wrote, adding that an Instagram video on July 28 “shows him walking off a plane in Miami, Florida, and picking up a loaded assault rifle.” Mr. Hernandez’s lawyer, Lance Lazzaro, said his client denied breaking any laws. In any event, Mr. Lazzaro argued, the arrests did not violate the 2015 plea agreement, which called for Mr. Hernandez to stay out of trouble for two years. Prosecutors countered that the plea agreement had been extended to give Mr. Hernandez more time to satisfy all of its conditions, including obtaining a G.E.D. Mr. Lazzarro told the justice that Mr. Hernandez had donated $50,000 to a school in Bushwick to be used for snacks and field trips, and had provided meals and money to the “less fortunate.” During his statement to the court, Mr. Hernandez described giving out money in Brooklyn, Chicago, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Justice Mennin said that although prosecutors had accused Mr. Hernandez of being part of a gang, he had not been charged with any gang-related activities. And she said that the incident in Houston may have involved “push back against an amateur paparazzi.” She also said that Mr. Hernandez’s “exaggerated overblown public persona” was well known to prosecutors when they made the plea agreement, adding, “You can’t punish people for the way they choose to market themselves.”",The New York Times
2018,Rare White Tiger Kills Zookeeper in Japan,"HONG KONG — A zookeeper in Japan died after being mauled by a rare white tiger, his supervisor said on Tuesday. The zookeeper, Akira Furusho, was found bleeding from the neck in a cage at the Hirakawa Zoological Park in the southern city of Kagoshima on Monday evening, Kyodo News reported. Riku, the 5-year-old male tiger that mauled Mr. Furusho, was sedated by rescue workers who arrived at the scene. Mr. Furusho, 40, was later pronounced dead at a hospital. No one was around at the time of the episode, “and we cannot imagine what happened,” Akinori Ishido, the zoo’s director, told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s extremely regrettable to lose staff in this way,” he added. Kyodo reported Tuesday that the police are investigating how the zoo cares for Riku and its three other white tigers. The news agency said that around the time of the attack, the staff had planned to move Riku from a display cage to his sleeping chamber. Mr. Ishido told reporters that staff members are not permitted to be in cages with dangerous animals, but that the rule was evidently broken in this case, The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. The zoo opened in 1972 and has more than 1,000 animals, including koalas, polar bears and red pandas, according to its website. Kyodo reported that Riku the white tiger is nearly six feet long and weighs about 375 pounds — as much as some sumo wrestlers. The Hirakawa Zoological Park was open on Tuesday, Kyodo reported, but access to the area near the tiger display was restricted. The episode was not the first tiger attack on a zookeeper in Japan. In 2008, for example, a Siberian tiger attacked and killed Atsushi Ito, a zookeeper who had been cleaning its cage at a zoo in Kyoto, the country’s former imperial capital, Kyodo reported. He died from a broken neck. The police later said they believed Mr. Ito had failed to close the doors to the cage properly after luring the tiger into a neighboring one by leaving a chicken inside. White tigers are Bengal tigers — not albinos or a separate species, as commonly thought, according to the Wildcat Sanctuary, a big-cat rescue facility in Minnesota. They are produced when two Bengal tigers with a recessive gene that controls coat color are bred together.",The New York Times
2018,"Ray Galton, Writer of Hit British Sitcoms, Is Dead at 88","Ray Galton, one of the creators of the landmark British comedy series “Steptoe and Son” — the inspiration for the hit American show “Sanford and Son” — died on Oct. 5. He was 88. His death was announced by his family, which said he had dementia. The announcement did not day where he died. Mr. Galton was a teenager being treated for tuberculosis at a sanitarium when he met Alan Simpson, a fellow tuberculosis patient there. The two became long-term writing partners. Their first major success was “Hancock’s Half Hour,” which they wrote for the popular postwar comedian Tony Hancock. “Hancock’s Half Hour” began on radio in 1954 and continued on television until 1961. The pair’s biggest hit was “Steptoe and Son,” a sitcom about father-and-son junk dealers, which ran from 1962 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1974. The American television producer Norman Lear acquired the rights to “Steptoe and Son” and adapted it into the long-running sitcom “Sanford and Son,” which starred Redd Foxx as the cantankerous father, a role played on “Steptoe and Son” by Wilfrid Brambell. Mr. Galton’s manager, Tessa Le Bars, called Mr. Galton and Mr. Simpson “the fathers and creators of British sitcom.” Mr. Simpson died last year at 87. Raymond Percy Galton was born on July 17, 1930, in Paddington, West London. Before meeting Mr. Simpson, he had worked for the Transport and General Workers’ Union; Mr. Simpson had been a shipping clerk. At the sanitarium, they began doing radio comedy in an amateur radio room as occupational therapy, according to their website biography. By 1951 they were writing professionally for the BBC, starting a career as one of Britain’s most successful comedy writing partnerships, producing material for comedians, television and movies.",The New York Times
2018,"Raye Montague, the Navy’s ‘Hidden Figure’ Ship Designer, Dies at 83","During World War II, when Raye Montague was 7 and growing up in Arkansas, her grandfather took her to see a traveling exhibit of a German submarine that had been captured off the coast of South Carolina. She was enchanted. “I looked through the periscope and saw all these dials and mechanisms,” she recalled years later. “And I said to the guy, ‘What do you have to know to do this?’ ” His response: “Oh, you’d have to be an engineer, but you don’t have to worry about that.” The clear implication was that as a black girl she could never become an engineer, let alone have anything to do with such a vessel. She would go on to prove him very wrong. The girl who faced racism and sexism in the segregated South, where she rode in the back of the bus and was denied entry to a college engineering program because she was black, became an internationally registered professional engineer and shattered the glass ceiling at the Navy when she became the first female program manager of ships. She earned the civilian equivalent of the rank of captain. In a breakthrough achievement, she also revolutionized the way the Navy designed ships and submarines using a computer program she developed in the early 1970s. It would have normally taken two years to produce a rough design of a ship on paper, but during the heat of the Vietnam War Ms. Montague was given one month to design the specifications for a frigate. She did it in 18 hours and 26 minutes. At the height of her career, she was briefing the Joint Chiefs of Staff every month and teaching at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. Many of her ship designs are still in use. Ms. Montague was one of a number of black women who, starting in the 1930s, performed invaluable, highly technical work for the United States government but who, working behind the scenes, were invisible to the public — and often to their colleagues. She died of congestive heart failure on Oct. 10 at a hospital in Little Rock, Ark., her son, David R. Montague, said. She was 83. Although she was decorated by the Navy, Ms. Montague, who retired from the service in 1990, was not acknowledged publicly until 2012, when The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette wrote an in-depth profile of her. She was not recognized nationally until the publication in 2016 of “Hidden Figures,” Margot Lee Shetterly’s best-selling account of the black female mathematicians at NASA who facilitated some of the nation’s greatest achievements in space. Their acclaim was amplified later that year when the book became an Oscar-nominated movie. The Navy honored Ms. Montague as its own “hidden figure” in 2017. She was inducted into the Arkansas Women’s Hall of Fame this year. Like her counterparts in the space program, Ms. Montague faced enormous obstacles — or what she called challenges, since she believed she could always find ways to work around anything that stood in her way. She grew up in Arkansas in the racially fraught 1950s, when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Ala., and Gov. Orval E. Faubus of Arkansas called up the National Guard to bar nine black students from the all-white Little Rock Central High School. But Ms. Montague had a certain confidence about herself, she said, instilled by her mother, who raised her alone. A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 “You’ll have three strikes against you,” her mother, Flossie (Graves) Jordan, told her, Ms. Montague recalled last year in an interview on the ABC program “Good Morning America.” “You’re female, you’re black and you’ll have a Southern segregated school education. But you can be or do anything you want, provided you’re educated.” Raye Jean Jordan was born in Little Rock on Jan. 21, 1935. Her father, Rayford Jordan, was not in the picture for long, and her mother raised her on her income from a cosmetology business. Ms. Montague graduated from Merrill High School in Pine Bluff, Ark., in 1952. A bright student who loved science and math, she wanted to study engineering at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. But because Arkansas colleges would not award such degrees to African-Americans in those days, she attended Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal College (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff). She graduated in 1956 with a degree in business. Still determined to become an engineer, she headed to Washington and secured a job with the Navy as a clerk-typist. She worked her way up, becoming a digital computer systems operator and a computer systems analyst in a male-dominated field. “I worked with guys who had graduated from Yale and Harvard with engineering degrees and people who had worked on the Manhattan Project developing the atom bomb,” Ms. Montague told The Democrat-Gazette. She took computer programming at night school and after a year asked for a promotion. Her boss, by her account, told her that if she wanted a promotion, she would have to work nights. That was tough for her. There was no public transportation at night, and she didn’t have a car. In fact, she didn’t know how to drive. But she went out and bought a 1949 Pontiac for $375 and had the salesman drive it to her house. She then taught herself to drive, leaving her house at 10 o’clock at night and creeping along the roads until arriving at work for the midnight shift. She got the promotion and returned to working days. The project that would be her signal achievement seemed to be an impossible task when it was assigned — to lay out, step by step, how a Naval ship might be designed using a computer. That had never been done before. Her boss (who didn’t like her, she said) gave her six months to complete the project, not telling her that his department had been trying to do it for years without success. Ms. Montague learned the computer system on her own and then told her boss that to install her program she would have to tear down the Navy’s computer and rebuild it. And that would mean working at night, she said. He told her she could work nights only if she had someone else with her, and then made it clear that he wouldn’t pay any of her colleagues overtime. She thought that his demand was frivolous and that he intended her to fail. Not to be deterred, Ms. Montague brought along her mother and her 3-year-old son. Finally impressed by her determination, her boss gave her extra staff. She met the deadline and presented him with her computer-generated designs for a ship. President Richard M. Nixon, who wanted the Navy to be able to produce ships at a faster pace, heard about her accomplishment and sent word for her to design a rough draft of an actual ship. They gave her all the staff she needed and an unlimited budget, her son said. It led to her designing the first Navy ship with a computer program, in less than 19 hours. For that feat she received the Navy’s Meritorious Civilian Service Award in 1972. The Navy began using her system to design all its ships and submarines. Her achievement put her on the map, and she began advising other government agencies and the private sector, including the automobile industry. Her last Navy project was the nuclear-powered Seawolf submarine. Along the way she was married three times, to Weldon A. Means in 1955, to David H. Montague in 1965 and to James Parrott in 1973. She had her only child, David, with Mr. Montague, who has since died. When her third marriage ended, she returned to using the name Montague. In addition to her son, she is survived by a granddaughter. After she retired, Ms. Montague moved back to Little Rock to be near her family. There she took part in civic organizations; mentored young people, including prison inmates; organized clothing drives; gave motivational talks; and played bridge. “She was busy opening doors for people and inspiring them,” her son said. “Her message was always the same: ‘Don’t let people put obstacles in front of you, but understand you also have to put in the work.’ She didn’t have any patience for people who weren’t willing to go the extra mile.”",The New York Times
2018,Read Susan Collins’s Speech Declaring Support for Brett Kavanaugh,"Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, announced her support on Friday for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. With Ms. Collins’s key vote, Judge Kavanaugh is all but certain to be confirmed to the Supreme Court. The announcement, delivered on the Senate floor, came after allegations of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh caused lawmakers and the White House to ask the F.B.I. to reopen an investigation into his background. The following is a transcript of Ms. Collins’s remarks, as released by her office. [For more coverage of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process, click here.] ______________ SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS: Mr. President, the five previous times that I have come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination of a justice to the United States Supreme Court, I have begun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of the occasion. But today we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of a gutter-level political campaign than a solemn occasion. The President nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July 9th. Within moments of that announcement, special interest groups raced to be the first to oppose him, including one organization that didn’t even bother to fill in the Judge’s name on its pre-written press release – they simply wrote that they opposed “Donald Trump’s nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States.” A number of Senators joined the race to announce their opposition, but they were beaten to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition before the nominee’s identity was even known. Since that time, we have seen special interest groups whip their followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentations and outright falsehoods about Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial record. Over-the-top rhetoric and distortions of his record and testimony at his first hearing produced short-lived headlines which, although debunked hours later, continue to live on and be spread through social media. Interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination. Our Supreme Court confirmation process has been in steady decline for more than thirty years. One can only hope that the Kavanaugh nomination is where the process has finally hit rock bottom. Against this backdrop, it is up to each individual Senator to decide what the Constitution’s “advice and consent” duty means. Informed by Alexander Hamilton’s Federalist 76, I have interpreted this to mean that the President has broad discretion to consider a nominee’s philosophy, whereas my duty as a Senator is to focus on the nominee’s qualifications as long as that nominee’s philosophy is within the mainstream of judicial thought. I have always opposed litmus tests for judicial nominees with respect to their personal views or politics, but I fully expect them to be able to put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the cases that come before them. I have never considered the President’s identity or party when evaluating Supreme Court nominations. As a result, I voted in favor of Justices Roberts and Alito, who were nominated by President Bush, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, who were nominated by President Obama, and Justice Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump. So I began my evaluation of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination by reviewing his 12-year record on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, including his more than 300 opinions and his many speeches and law review articles. Nineteen attorneys, including lawyers from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, briefed me many times each week and assisted me in evaluating the judge’s extensive record. I met with Judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my office. I listened carefully to the testimony at the Committee hearings. I spoke with people who knew him personally, such as Condoleezza Rice and many others. And, I talked with Judge Kavanaugh a second time by phone for another hour to ask him very specific additional questions. I have also met with thousands of my constituents, both advocates and many opponents, regarding Judge Kavanaugh. One concern that I frequently heard was that Judge Kavanaugh would be likely to eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) vital protections for people with pre-existing conditions. I disagree with this contention. In a dissent in Seven-Sky v. Holder, Judge Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the ACA on narrow procedural grounds, preserving the law in full. Many experts have said his dissent informed Justice Roberts’ opinion upholding the ACA at the Supreme Court. Furthermore, Judge Kavanaugh’s approach toward the doctrine of severability is narrow. When a part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, he has argued for severing the invalid clause as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact. This was his approach in his dissent in a case that involved a challenge to the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (PPH v. CFPB). In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued for “severing any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.” Given the current challenges to the ACA, proponents, including myself, of protections for people with pre-existing conditions should want a Justice who would take just this kind of approach. Another assertion I have heard often is that Judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the President were to come before the Court. The basis for this argument seems to be twofold. First, Judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes that Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while in office. Mr. President, I believe opponents miss the mark on this issue. The fact that Judge Kavanaugh offered this legislative proposal suggests that he believes that the President does not have such protection currently. Second, there are some who argue that given the current Special Counsel investigation, President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate a justice. That argument ignores our recent history. President Clinton, in 1993, nominated Justice Ginsburg after the Whitewater investigation was already underway. And she was confirmed 96-3. The next year, just three months after Independent Counsel Robert Fiske was named to lead the Whitewater investigation, President Clinton nominated Justice Breyer. He was confirmed 87-9. Supreme Court Justices have not hesitated to rule against the presidents who have nominated them. Perhaps most notably in United States v. Nixon, three Nixon appointees who heard the case joined the unanimous opinion against him. Judge Kavanaugh has been unequivocal in his belief that no president is above the law. He has stated that Marbury v. Madison, Youngstown Steel v. Sawyer and United States v. Nixon are three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases in history. What do they have in common? Each of them is a case where the Court served as a check on presidential power. And I would note that the fourth case that Judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as the greatest in history was Brown v Board of Education. One Kavanaugh decision illustrates the point about the check on presidential power directly. He wrote the opinion in Hamdan v. United States, a case that challenged the Bush Administration’s military commission prosecution of an associate of Osama Bin Laden. This conviction was very important to the Bush Administration, but Judge Kavanaugh, who had been appointed to the DC Circuit by President Bush and had worked in President Bush’s White House, ruled that the conviction was unlawful. As he explained during the hearing, “We don’t make decisions based on who people are, or their policy preferences, or the moment. We base decisions on the law….” Others I met with have expressed concerns that Justice Kennedy’s retirement threatens the right of same sex couples to marry. Yet, Judge Kavanaugh described the Obergefell decision, which legalized same gender marriages, as an important landmark precedent. He also cited Justice Kennedy’s recent Masterpiece Cakeshop opinion for the Court’s majority stating that: “The days of treating gay and lesbian Americans or gay and lesbian couples as second-class citizens who are inferior in dignity and worth are over in the Supreme Court.” Others have suggested that the judge holds extreme views on birth control. In one case, Judge Kavanaugh incurred the disfavor of both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers with religious objections. Although his critics frequently overlook this point, Judge Kavanaugh’s dissent rejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception. In fact, he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent “strongly suggested” that there was a “compelling interest” in facilitating access to birth control. There has also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that Judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade. Protecting this right is important to me. To my knowledge, Judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee to express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition, but rooted in Article III of our Constitution itself. He believes that precedent “is not just a judicial policy … it is constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay heed to rules of precedent.” In other words, precedent isn’t a goal or an aspiration; it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances. The judge further explained that precedent provides stability, predictability, reliance, and fairness. There are, of course, rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court would rightly overturn a precedent. The most famous example was when the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, correcting a “grievously wrong” decision—to use the judge’s term—allowing racial inequality. But, someone who believes that the importance of precedent has been rooted in the Constitution would follow long-established precedent except in those rare circumstances where a decision is “grievously wrong” or “deeply inconsistent with the law.” Those are Judge Kavanaugh’s phrases. As Judge Kavanaugh asserted to me, a long-established precedent is not something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked. Its roots in the Constitution give the concept of stare decisis greater weight such that precedent can’t be trimmed or narrowed simply because a judge might want to on a whim. In short, his views on honoring precedent would preclude attempts to do by stealth that which one has committed not to do overtly. Noting that Roe v. Wade was decided 45 years ago, and reaffirmed 19 years later in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, I asked Judge Kavanaugh whether the passage of time is relevant to following precedent. He said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence. Our discussion then turned to the right of privacy, on which the Supreme Court relied in Griswold v. Connecticut, a case that struck down a law banning the use and sale of contraceptives. Griswold established the legal foundation that led to Roe eight years later. In describing Griswold as “settled law,” Judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application of two famous cases from the 1920s, Meyer and Pierce, that are not seriously challenged by anyone today. Finally, in his testimony, he noted repeatedly that Roe had been upheld by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, describing it as “precedent on precedent.” When I asked him would it be sufficient to overturn a long-established precedent if five current justices believed it was wrongly decided, he emphatically said “no.” Opponents frequently cite then-candidate Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn Roe. The Republican platform for all presidential campaigns has included this pledge since at least 1980. During this time, Republican presidents have appointed Justices O’Connor, Souter, and Kennedy to the Supreme Court. These are the very three justices—Republican president appointed justices—who authored the Casey decision, which reaffirmed Roe. Furthermore, pro-choice groups vigorously opposed each of these justices’ nominations. Incredibly, they even circulated buttons with the slogan “Stop Souter Or Women Will Die!” Just two years later, Justice Souter co-authored the Casey opinion, reaffirming a woman’s right to choose. Suffice it to say, prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong. These same interest groups have speculated that Judge Kavanaugh was selected to do the bidding of conservative ideologues, despite his record of judicial independence. I asked the judge point blank whether he had made any commitments or pledges to anyone at the White House, to the Federalist Society, or to any outside group on how he would decide cases. He unequivocally assured me he had not. Judge Kavanaugh has received rave reviews for his 12-year track record as a judge, including for his judicial temperament. The American Bar Association (ABA) gave him its highest possible rating. Its Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted an extraordinarily thorough assessment, soliciting input from almost 500 people, including his judicial colleagues. The ABA concluded that “his integrity, judicial temperament, and professional competence met the highest standard.” Lisa Blatt, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman in history, testified: “By any objective measure, Judge Kavanaugh is clearly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.” “His opinions are invariably thoughtful and fair….” Ms. Blatt, who clerked for and is an ardent admirer of Justice Ginsburg, and who is, in her own words, “an unapologetic defender of a woman’s right to choose,” said that Judge Kavanaugh “fit[s] in the mainstream of legal thought.” She also observed that “Judge Kavanaugh is remarkably committed to promoting women in the legal profession.” That Judge Kavanaugh is more of a centrist than some of his critics maintain is reflected in the fact that he and Chief Judge Merrick Garland voted the same way in 93 percent of the cases that they heard together. Indeed, Chief Judge Garland joined in more than 96 percent of the majority opinions authored by Judge Kavanaugh, dissenting only once. Despite all this, after weeks of reviewing Judge Kavanaugh’s record and listening to 32 hours of his testimony, the Senate’s advice and consent role was thrown into a tailspin following the allegations of sexual assault by Professor Christine Blasey Ford. The confirmation process now involves evaluating whether or not Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault, and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee. Some argue that because this is a lifetime appointment to our highest court, the public interest requires that doubts be resolved against the nominee. Others see the public interest as embodied in our long-established tradition of affording to those accused of misconduct a presumption of innocence. In cases in which the facts are unclear, they would argue that the question should be resolved in favor of the nominee. Mr. President, I understand both viewpoints. This debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial. But certain fundamental legal principles—about due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairness—do bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon them. In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be. We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy. The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent function when an accusation departs from a nominee’s otherwise exemplary record. I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward. Some of the allegations levied against Judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important. I am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by Professor Ford, but of the allegation that, when he was a teenager, Judge Kavanaugh drugged multiple girls and used their weakened state to facilitate gang rape. This outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parroted public statements of others. That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness. Mr. President, I listened carefully to Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony before the Judiciary Committee. I found her testimony to be sincere, painful, and compelling. I believe that she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life. Nevertheless, the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the assault occurred; none of the individuals Professor Ford says were at the party has any recollection at all of that night. Judge Kavanaugh forcefully denied the allegations under penalty of perjury. Mark Judge denied under penalty of felony that he had witnessed an assault. PJ Smyth, another person allegedly at the party, denied that he was there under penalty of felony. Professor Ford’s lifelong friend Leland Keyser indicated that, under penalty of felony, she does not remember that party. And Ms. Keyser went further. She indicated that not only does she not remember a night like that, but also that she does not even know Brett Kavanaugh. In addition to the lack of corroborating evidence, we also learned some facts that raised more questions. For instance, since these allegations have become public, Professor Ford testified that not a single person has contacted her to say, “I was at the party that night.” Furthermore, the professor testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening, she knew that, because of the distance, she would have needed a ride – yet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the one that drove her home or were in the car with her that night. And Professor Ford also indicated that even though she left that small gathering of six or so people abruptly and without saying goodbye and distraught, none of them called her the next day – or ever – to ask why she left – is she okay – not even her closest friend, Ms. Keyser. Mr. President, the Constitution does not provide guidance as to how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims. It leaves that decision up to each Senator. This is not a criminal trial, and I do not believe that claims such as these need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, fairness would dictate that the claims at least should meet a threshold of “more likely than not” as our standard. The facts presented do not mean that Professor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night – or at some other time – but they do lead me to conclude that the allegations fail to meet the “more likely than not” standard. Therefore, I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the Court. Let me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be misconstrued as suggesting that unwanted sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country. To the contrary, if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process, it has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the pervasiveness of this terrible problem. I have been alarmed and disturbed, however, by some who have suggested that unless Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is rejected, the Senate is somehow condoning sexual assault. Nothing could be further from the truth. Every person—man or woman—who makes a charge of sexual assault deserves to be heard and treated with respect. The #MeToo movement is real. It matters. It is needed. And it is long overdue. We know that rape and sexual assault are less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault. On average, an estimated 211,000 rapes and sexual assaults go unreported every year. We must listen to survivors, and every day we must seek to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many. We owe this to ourselves, our children, and generations to come. Since the hearing, I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault. Many were total strangers who told me their heart-wrenching stories for the first time in their lives. Some were friends I have known for decades, yet with the exception of one woman who had confided in me years ago, I had no idea that they had been the victims of sexual attacks. I am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward, and I hope that in heightening public awareness, they have also lightened the burden that they have been quietly bearing for so many years. To them, I pledge to do all that I can to ensure that their daughters and granddaughters never share their experiences. Over the past few weeks, I have been emphatic that the Senate has an obligation to investigate and evaluate the serious allegations of sexual assault. I called for and supported the additional hearing to hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I also pushed for and supported the FBI supplemental background investigation. This was the right thing to do. Christine Ford never sought the spotlight. She indicated that she was terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she has shunned attention since then. She seemed completely unaware of Chairman Grassley’s offer to allow her to testify confidentially in California. Watching her, Mr. President, I could not help but feel that some people who wanted to engineer the defeat of this nomination cared little, if at all, for her well-being. Professor Ford testified that a very limited number of people had access to her letter. Yet that letter found its way into the public domain. She testified that she never gave permission for that very private letter to be released. And yet, here we are. We are in the middle of a fight that she never sought, arguing about claims that she wanted to raise confidentially. One theory I have heard espoused repeatedly is that our colleague, Senator Feinstein, leaked Professor Ford’s letter at the eleventh hour to derail this process. I want to state this very clearly: I know Senator Dianne Feinstein extremely well, and I believe that she would never do that. I knew that to be the case before she even stated it at the hearing. She is a person of integrity, and I stand by her. I have also heard some argue that the Chairman of the Committee somehow treated Professor Ford unfairly. Nothing could be further from the truth. Chairman Grassley, along with his excellent staff, treated Professor Ford with compassion and respect throughout the entire process. And that is the way the Senator from Iowa has conducted himself throughout a lifetime dedicated to public service. But the fact remains, Mr. President, that someone leaked this letter against Professor Ford’s express wishes. I suspect, regrettably, that we will never know for certain who did it. To that leaker, who I hope is listening now, let me say that what you did was unconscionable. You have taken a survivor who was not only entitled to your respect, but who also trusted you to protect her – and you have sacrificed her well-being in a misguided attempt to win whatever political crusade you think you are fighting. My only hope is that your callous act has turned this process into such a dysfunctional circus that it will cause the Senate – and indeed all Americans – to reconsider how we evaluate Supreme Court nominees. If that happens, then the appalling lack of compassion you afforded Professor Ford will at least have some unintended positive consequences. Mr. President, the politically charged atmosphere surrounding this nomination had reached a fever pitch even before these allegations were known, and it has been challenging even then to separate fact from fiction. We live in a time of such great disunity, as the bitter fight over this nomination both in the Senate and among the public clearly demonstrates. It is not merely a case of different groups having different opinions. It is a case of people bearing extreme ill will toward those who disagree with them. In our intense focus on our differences, we have forgotten the common values that bind us together as Americans. When some of our best minds are seeking to develop ever more sophisticated algorithms designed to link us to websites that only reinforce and cater to our views, we can only expect our differences to intensify. This would have alarmed the drafters of our Constitution, who were acutely aware that different values and interests could prevent Americans from becoming and remaining a single people. Indeed, of the six objectives they invoked in the preamble to the Constitution, the one that they put first was the formation of “a more perfect Union.” Their vision of “a more perfect Union” does not exist today, and if anything, we appear to be moving farther away from it. It is particularly worrisome that the Supreme Court, the institution that most Americans see as the principal guardian of our shared constitutional heritage, is viewed as part of the problem through a political lens. Mr. President, we’ve heard a lot of charges and counter charges about Judge Kavanaugh. But as those who have known him best have attested, he has been an exemplary public servant, judge, teacher, coach, husband, and father. Despite the turbulent, bitter fight surrounding his nomination, my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5-4 decisions and so that public confidence in our Judiciary and our highest court is restored. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.",The New York Times
2018,Read These 3 Books on Trans Rights and Gender Identity,"Newsbook A proposal by the Department of Health and Human Services argues for a more narrow definition of gender that would threaten protections of the transgender community under federal civil rights law. These three books by trans writers explore the historical precedent for nonbinary gender expression and the personal experience of being transgender. A QUEER AND PLEASANT DANGERA MemoirBy Kate Bornstein280 pp. Beacon Press. (2012) In this memoir, the playwright and actress Kate Bornstein recounts “the true story of a nice Jewish boy who joins the Church of Scientology and leaves 12 years later to become the lovely lady she is today,” per the book’s jacket. Bornstein knew she was a girl from a very young age, but it would take her many years to fully transition from AI to Kate. She was attracted to the Church of Scientology because “thetans have no gender” (thetan is a term used to describe the immortal self or the soul), but is later kicked out and, after, she seeks therapy and starts her transition. Her experience as a trans woman drives this story, but along the way, Bornstein touches on mental health and sexuality, sharing anecdotes like her foray into S&M culture. [ Read why Zackary Drucker, a producer on “Transparent,” called this one of her favorite books. ] TRANS LIKE MEConversations For All of UsBy CN Lester240 pp. Seal Press. (2018) In this collection of essays, Lester, a British activist and singer-songwriter who identifies as nonbinary, draws from research and personal experience to question and debunk myths related to transgender identity. Lester finds precedent for the use of the pronoun “they” in literature as far back as Shakespeare, for instance, and argues that transgender people have been largely excluded from historical narratives and movements. The book also offers an insider’s look at Lester’s evolving understanding of gender in our society and personal struggles with self-identification. STONE BUTCH BLUESBy Leslie Feinberg320 pp. Alyson Books. (1993) Considered a classic of trans literature, this novel, originally published in 1993, tells the story of Jess Goldberg’s struggles with gender identity while living in a blue-collar town in the 1950s. It follows Jess through the next couple of decades, coming out as butch before identifying as transgender. A 20th anniversary edition was published before the writer died in 2014, and in an author’s note, Feinberg wrote that “with this novel I planted a flag: Here I am — does anyone else want to discuss these important issues?” Feinberg made the book available for free.",The New York Times

2018,Reader Idea | College Students and Disabled Adults Create Spooky Found Poetry Together,"Here is a special Halloween-appropriate edition of our Great Ideas from Readers series. It tells the story of what happened when a college class and a program for adults with intellectual disabilities came together to experiment with poetry. Using our Found Poem Student Contest guidelines and a Times article about Edgar Allan Poe, the class composed spooky poems, which you can read below. But you can also experiment with the same technique yourself, using any article about hauntings or horrors you can find on the Times Topics page on Halloween, or in our special collection, Haunting Ideas: Halloween-Themed Teaching and Learning With The New York Times. Finally, if you teach with The Times, please tell us about it here. You can also browse our full collection of Reader Ideas. _________ In September, 2017, Empire State College (ESC) formed a partnership with a local day program called “Lifestyles for the Disabled.” ESC is part of a cohort of colleges across Staten Island that invite adults with intellectual disabilities into their campus classrooms. Louise Vallario from Lifestyles and I initially collaborated informally to foster the partnership at Empire, which took six months to bring to fruition. We decided to teach poetry to a class of matriculated students from Empire who would be joined by Lifestyle students who were interested in postsecondary education. As we planned for National Poetry Month in April, we came across the Learning Network’s Ninth Annual Found Poem Student Contest. Although the Lifestyles students were too old to qualify under the rules, which say that participants should be 13 to 19 years old, we decided to tackle what seemed like a stimulating exercise anyway. After teaching the students the definition of a found poem, we showed them examples of this kind of poetry, which is formed by taking words and phrases from existing sources, like newspaper articles. We had been talking about Edgar Allan Poe’s poetry and life for most of the semester, and we all agreed to use him as our subject. Because the contest asks that students find a rich Times article to be the source of the words and phrases that will make the found poetry, we chose Charles McGrath’s “The Writer and Man, Evermore.” We explained the rules to the students and distributed copies of the article. The students were then encouraged to form groups and collaborate on a group poem. It was slow going at first. Empire students were instructed to read the article for homework. We suggested that the Lifestyles students not read the article in order to make sense of it but instead “mine” it for the words that would make up their poems. All students were reminded to circle words that spoke to them about Poe, and were told to black out the words that they considered irrelevant. When the joint class ended, there was still a lot of work to do, so the following day the Lifestyles students continued to work with Ms. Vallario their own classroom. The following day, the Lifestyles students brought their drafts and completed them with their Empire State partners. Then — the best part — they shared their jointly-created poetry by reading it aloud in front of the classroom. In the final evaluation of this exercise, we realized how much the Lifestyles students had enhanced their language and speaking skills. We also realized that the Empire students had enhanced a skill set that we cannot quantify: They had formed more than partnerships with the Lifestyle students; they had forged friendships that were based on their work together and their exchange of ideas. The Empire students seemed also to have come to a revelation about individuals with disabilities, and were shocked at what they learned: People with disabilities have hidden strengths and a strong desire to learn. In the end, many Empire students told us this exercise made them think our society should be more inclusive of the disabled than it is now. A piece for the SIExpress tells more about the collaboration between Empire College and the Lifestyles for the Disabled students, and features the video above highlighting more of the poetry the groups wrote and read together. What Times articles might provide the material for great found poems by your students? For example, what could they make from this piece about a place that is rumored to be haunted? To get inspired, take a look at the poems the Empire groups made with from the Times article about Edgar Allan Poe.

2018,Readers Respond to the 10.14.2018 Issue,"The Thread Re: The ‘Walmart of Heroin’ Jennifer Percy wrote about how addicts from across the United States travel to a Philadelphia neighborhood that is the largest open-air narcotics market for heroin on the East Coast. This is the most profound article I have read in years. And the most sad. Jennifer Percy should be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for this. The article has allowed me to see how intractable our own “homeless” problem in San Francisco will be without first addressing the drug epidemic. So much of this started with the advertised-as-safe drugs like OxyContin that were approved by the F.D.A. and marketed misleadingly, which led users down the path to heroin. The article shows what a death sentence heroin is, both for the users and for the community that the users (and pushers) inhabit. Why do we as a civilized, supposedly advanced society allow this? J.M. Mackowski, California Devastating. As a San Franciscan, I see this same pandemic rising and rising. We keep focusing on the economic challenges and the lack of housing, but clearly the biggest element is that in our city, we have the same drug ecosystem: users and suppliers nearby, and the means, through panhandling and unrelenting petty theft, to acquire small amounts of money to feed the cycle. Philadelphia’s example shows that there is no simple, unifying solution. All I can imagine is some mass medical fix, some way to immunize addicts so they can no longer get high and thus end the cycle. If nothing is done at some point, there will be a huge backlash and forced treatment that will place civil liberties in danger. Mel Baker, San Francisco Re: On Medicine Siddhartha Mukherjee wrote about how doctors can avoid burning out while practicing medicine. I was excited to read the On Medicine column by Siddhartha Mukherjee. In residency, I listened to the 22-hour audiobook of his work “The Emperor of All Maladies,” a great example of the way a physician can contribute to the popular understanding of medicine and write for a lay audience. However, I was saddened to learn that Mukherjee’s conclusion was that physicians should subspecialize and do more research. As an academic generalist in obstetrics and gynecology, I have purposefully chosen not to subspecialize, because I believe that women need doctors who can care for them and consider their medical issues within the context of their reproductive life cycle. I like to think there is value not only in treating the abnormal Pap test but also in considering how it may affect a woman’s future reproductive plans. Or how the method of delivery could affect a woman’s future pregnancies. As Mukherjee points out, physicians who practice in emergency-oriented subspecialties and are confronted frequently by lawsuits are most at risk for burnout. Doctors frequently joke about the annual “wellness” lectures at our various institutions that advise us to avoid burnout by practicing self-care. But what is sequestering yourself in a tidy research niche, except self-care taken to its extreme? In that world, who will staff labor and delivery, the trauma bay and the emergency department? Alice Sutton, U.C. San Diego Health Let’s not forget the physician assistants and nurse practitioners. In the surgical theater, we’re expected to see patients with the same acuity, complete the same charts and work similar hours while being paid a fraction of the M.D. salary. Before I became an advanced-practice nurse, I predicted being tired, and I could even imagine feeling burned out. However, I didn’t anticipate the professional isolation and the strains it can cause in a care team. Isabel Vargas, La Mesa, Calif. Mukherjee describes relationships formed working together dissecting a cadaver. This took me right back to my anatomy lab 44 years ago. Mukherjee hooked me with how he wove the lives of his group with facts about medicine today and physician burnout. I agree with his many valid points. He ends, however, by suggesting that burnout is prevented by doing “more.” For physicians who do full-time clinical practice, we need structural changes.

2018,Readers Respond to the 10.7.2018 Issue,"The Thread Re: Lady Gaga Isn’t Done Shape-Shifting Yet Rachel Syme wrote about Lady Gaga’s reinvention as a movie star. It’s not often that a star in one area of the entertainment industry moves up the proverbial ladder to another area of the entertainment industry. It seems as if this is the case with Lady Gaga and her major leading role in “A Star is Born.” Bravo to her. Jim Starrett, Venice, Calif. Re: Should Art be a Battleground for Social Justice? Wesley Morris wrote about how, in 2018, culture is being evaluated more for its moral correctness than its quality. Wesley Morris’s article in last week’s magazine was a refreshing invitation to recommit to nonexpedient thought, in daily life and across our communities. In mapping recent cultural history, righteous moralizing and performative “wokeness,” he is incisive yet gentle in his approach. He doesn’t tear down, but rather fleshes out how “Everything means too much now” — and what the consequences are for critical thought and human connection. Were I still teaching college courses on United States history, race and cultural politics, I would assign this piece as required reading, alongside Sarah Schulman’s book “Conflict Is Not Abuse.” Each author’s work speaks to the profound degradation of communities (of thought and practice) when artists are so readily “canceled” and cast aside, or thoughtlessly lifted up and consumed. Thank you to Mr. Morris for his intellectually muscular, robust and generous offering in this year’s Culture Issue. Lydia Brassard, Albany There is much to disagree with in this essay, from the lede (“Everything means too much now”), to the final (spoiler alert) apologia for “The Cosby Show,” to the underlying critical stance, which boils down to “If I like it, it’s ‘art judged on the merits’; if you like it, it’s ‘moral judgment.’ ” But something else is missing. What set off the convulsions of the last 30 years? You might have to look a little further back in history, to the breakdown of institutional authority, a slow-motion implosion that by the 1960s was well underway and by the Reagan era almost complete. Gone are the days when the power to set the cultural agenda was concentrated in the hands of three networks and four critics. I happen to think that’s largely a good thing. Luke Jaeger, Northampton, Mass. Virginia Woolf addressed something of Morris’s dilemma when she wrote: “To speak without figure she had thought of something, something about the body, about the passions which it was unfitting for her as a woman to say. Men, her reason told her, would be shocked.” This implies that where creators find that their simply having expressed something has social meaning, they have to consider that how their creation will be received by gatekeepers of the dominant group is the last thing they should think about. In 2018 creators have ways of finding audiences that bypass these gatekeepers altogether. What happens to the critic who might be shocked? In 2018 they can’t say anything obviously racist or sexist lest they lose their gatekeeper status. As “I was shocked” or “This is motivated by hatred” are not particularly helpful, “I didn’t understand” or “This is what I thought the person was trying to tell me about their group” or “This was my abstract train of thought inspired by the work of art” might be of use. You may not have the experience to know if what the person is trying to say is true, but you can say whether the writer expressed it or not. Later on in the process, creators may understand that a general industry award means valuable representation for their group and test themselves against the tastes and preferences of the people who vote on these awards. Not that anyone involved with “Moonlight” necessarily did this, or that anyone should bother in the case of the Grammys, whose incomprehension of hip-hop is entirely too well known by now. (The irony is that Bruno Mars and the nostalgic, insanely popular, perfectly crafted pop album he made is entirely acceptable to traditional Grammy voters. He was the predictable choice for them in the ballot that saw the light of day. A ballot with Ed Sheeran might have split that vote and let Kendrick Lamar get through.)

2018,Readers Respond to the 9.30.18 Issue,"The Thread Re: Gary Keith and Ron, the Magi of Mets Nation Devin Gordon wrote about the Mets broadcasting trio. I may reside in New England, but my baseball heart lives in Queens. Devin Gordon’s tribute to Gary Keith and Ron is a perfect example of why great sportswriting is classic literature. “Yankee fans might want to skip this next part, because it gets a little mean, but just know that it comes from a vein of bitterness so deep I might bleed out once I open it.” If these words were written as a simple four-line stanza, it would be poetry. The icing on this cake of an article is Dolly Faibyshev’s photo of the three broadcasters tossing a ball in the air to themselves. It captures the whole story. Gary, in the middle, seems to be tossing the ball with his whole hand, as all amateurs might do. Ron and Keith show their tossing hands in a closed position, because, as pros, they simply spin the ball into the air. Ron intently watches the ball as it travels through the air, admiring his craft. He is a pitcher. Keith has no need to watch the ball. He knows in his bones where it is, and his hand will know where to go, when to open and when to close to catch his flip. He is a ballplayer! Allan Polak, Connecticut As one of those Mets fans whose longtime devotion — this season, at least — has been exceeded only by an otherwise latent masochistic streak, I’d like to thank Devin Gordon for telling the rest of the world what we already knew: The trio is — not arguably! — the best broadcast team in the game. Gordon was also totally right to end with “Next year, we’re going to be really good.” Let’s hope that Oscar Wilde’s — or Dr. Johnson’s — “the triumph of hope over experience” doesn’t apply! Susan H. Llewellyn, New York Re: The Crisis of Election Security Kim Zetter wrote about how America’s electronic voting systems are more vulnerable than ever. There is no more important national or local issue than our election system. If we are not willing to spend enough to ensure that we have a system of the highest integrity and security, then any other investment in our military or civil society is meaningless. Flaws in our election system, coupled with Republican efforts to add more barriers to voting, will do more to undermine our democracy than any outside force could ever do. If we love our country as much as we claim to, then we must ensure that our voting systems are secure and that every citizen is given an equal chance to vote so that our views are properly reflected in local, state and federal offices, no matter where we live, whom we love, how wealthy we are or what we look like. Edwin Andrews, Massachusetts Thanks to Kim Zetter and The New York Times Magazine for her deeply probing and alarming examination of the unaddressed vulnerability of our election system to computerized fraud, and the quiet coup in which the voting-equipment industry has taken private control of a quintessentially public function. But I do not know what to make of the “if only someone had warned us this was coming” thread that runs through Zetter’s narrative. As someone who has dedicated most of my working life since 2002 to sounding this alarm, and gathering and analyzing evidence to support that sounding, I wish to put it on the record that America was warned loud and clear. My election-integrity colleagues and I did our best to raise awareness and convey the urgency. That we were ignored, or scoffed at as “conspiracy theorists,” is a tragedy for which many in positions of influence bear much responsibility. I can only share the hope that what should have been front and center in the public discourse starting 15 years ago at the dawn of the computerized-voting era will be placed there now as the crisis it is — and not pushed aside until public, observable vote counting is restored to our elections.

2018,Readers Tell Scientists Who Say Dogs Aren’t Geniuses: ‘My Dog Is Exceptional’,"Dog lovers challenged a study that found canines to be smart but not “exceptional” by citing their own pets. The fur was flying in the comments section of a recent Science article about a study that found that dogs were no more intelligent than other animals. Readers challenged the research’s findings — and cited their own pooches as evidence. In the study, scientists looked at members of three similar groups: carnivores, social hunters and domestic animals. Like horses and pigeons, dogs can be trained to perform tasks. And unlike dolphins and chimpanzees, they cannot use tools. But what about Sylvie, the late dog of one reader, who “used her paw like a tool — a scythe, to be exact” for cutting grass?” And what about the dog who once faked a limp, while begging for pizza, according to another reader? “You will never convince me he’s not a genius,” she wrote. Here is a selection of readers’ comments. They have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. If you’re also having a hard time accepting the study’s findings, tell us in the comments. By far, the smartest dog I ever met was Mr. Sunshine, Sunshi, a golden retriever. We had many long conversations, and I have no doubt that Sunshi understood. I never had to tell him something twice. Just one example: We were out for a walk, and there was some glass on the sidewalk. I said, “Sunshi, that’s glass and it can hurt your paws,” and he walked around it. — Eugene, New York City My late, beloved dog Sylvie loved eating the tall grass that grew along our walking route. The stems were tough to pull out with her teeth alone, so she would use her paw to bend the stem, and then while the blade was tightly gripped in her jaw, she would exert a quick thrust to sever it. Sylvie used her paw like a tool — a scythe, to be exact. — Bill Bartelt, Chicago Dogs use humans as tools. Does any other species do that? If a ball is stuck under the entertainment center, after trying, the dog will come and get me by barking or nudging me. — adonovzn, Pennsylvania For about a half-year in my youth, I lived in a village in the Pyrenees where my neighbors were shepherds. I’d encounter them on walks. One day I asked the boss, “Mr. Vidal, how do you manage all these animals by leaning up against a rock and smoking your pipe?” He responded: “Well, I’ll tell you my secret: The goats have minds of their own, always looking for good grass, and the sheep just follow. I give orders to my dog, who keeps the goats from straying out of my sight, and the sheep just follow.” His dog lay under the dinner table, getting fed good meaty scraps. Smart enough! — P and S, Los Angeles In winter, I put my bichon/Shih Tzu mix and my toy poodle on the bed in order to put their little rubber boots on. While I’m getting the poodle’s boots on, the other dog covers up his boots with the throw at the end of the bed. I’m sure he’s hoping, “Out of sight, out of mind.” — Kathryn, New York City My dog once faked a limp in an attempt to get some pizza. You will never convince me he’s not a genius. — Jen, Seattle I am a veterinarian and have worked with a broad spectrum of species, from cats to cattle. I find that people tend to classify animal intelligence based on human intelligence and how people learn and react to their environment. In my opinion, animals express intelligence in different ways. The authors are also wrong about one important thing: My dog is exceptional. — Joe Klopfenstein, Corvallis, Ore.",The New York Times
2018,Readers respond to the 9.23.2018 issue.,"The Thread RE: Listen to the World From the crunch of lava in Kilauea to the songs of Madagascar lemurs, our fall Voyages Issue was dedicated to sounds from across the world. What a huge treat to listen to the Voyages Issue of The New York Times Magazine. I normally like to sneak away with the paper while my young kids are occupied with their Legos, but today I was able to involve them completely, and they absolutely loved listening to the cries of the lemur and the rattling sounds of the lava. Please do this again — though maybe consider a kids’ version with just the sounds (and no narration) so we can play a guessing game and try to match the pictures with their corresponding sounds. Heather Birchall, Sunnyvale, Calif. Congratulations on yesterday’s issue. It was extraordinary. We are an international community of nuns in Chicago, and we listened to your issue with a sister from India, one from Colombia and three Americans. We thought your creativity deserves an A-plus. We all enjoyed it very much. Mary Ellen Moore, Chicago I just listened to your audio NY Times Magazine and was reminded of the tours I do at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon for blind or low-vision visitors. The verbal is what I work with when I describe works of art, but I am now inspired to try audio with our visitors. Audio takes the verbal description to another level — a closer, more intimate level that one would normally not hear. This issue is wonderful. It is almost spiritual in its association with various sounds emitted by objects and living organisms. Thank you so much for taking my listening experience to new heights! Barbara Hart, Portland, Ore. You made me feel sentimental about the chaos of a Nigerian intersection. That is what good writing can do, with the help of the stunning soundtrack you provided. This demonstrates that one person can step into another’s shoes and see the world differently. “Sublime” is an understatement. It was so impactful and spiritually touching. What a great way to inspire all of us, at any age. When there is such a high bar to keep our attention due to our overstimulating environment, you succeeded to go beyond entertainment and provided inspiration and awe with the simplicity of nature. This is a wake-up call to all of us to save our greatest asset, the environment. William Hoskyns Congratulations on today’s issue of The New York Times Magazine. The sound editing was perfect; the photography beautiful. I was moved by the stories and voices. Thank you for the reminder that our world is so special, even in these times, and that we can always find awe, delight, wonder and joy in it, if we only listen. In gratitude. Leslie George, Syracuse I just wanted to say bravo and thank you for the most recent edition of The New York Times Magazine (the fall Voyages Issue). Having an audio tour of the photographs was brilliant, and a really stirring experience. I also loved how it connected to an article in the Travel section of the paper a few Sundays ago about an audio tour of London led by a woman with synesthesia. The idea of picking destinations based on experiencing new soundscapes is delightful, and makes the world wider and more full of wonder. Jarom McDonald, Oceanside, Calif. What a delightful new journey for the reader/listener in the sound and photography of this issue. Additionally, while my husband and I listened to the audio on speaker phones, my puppy was very engaged at hearing the indris sing from Madagascar — every note brought her closer to the phone. Jenelle Lozano, Huntersville, N.C. What a wonderful audiovisual experience you and your team have made available for anyone willing to take the time! Thank you very much for this superb innovation. I so hope that numerous subscribers and other readers of The New York Times get to enjoy this artistic masterpiece as much as I have, and that they, too, will express their appreciation. Keep up your excellent work. Nicholas S. Molinari, Brick, N.J. I just listened to/read the magazine from the past weekend and I was impressed with the result. I was initially not happy when I saw that my magazine did not have the regular features that I enjoy. But after listening I thought it was brilliant. Larry Comparone",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Readers’ Favorite Protest Songs: A Call to Make Some Noise,"From Pete Seeger to Public Enemy, the music that inspires our readers to take a stand. Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. What songs spur you to political action? In “Them’s Fightin’ Words: 10 Great Protest Songs,” Loudon Wainwright III, the singer-songwriter, reminisces about traveling to Newport, R.I., as a teenager to hear Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and Joan Baez rouse the crowd. He draws from that memory and others to create a list of songs that have inspired him to challenge the status quo. Mr. Wainwright admits that many of his picks are “oldies” (Mr. Seeger made the list twice) and that the collection is probably incomplete without voices like that of Marvin Gaye and Phil Ochs. Readers obligingly helped round out the list by suggesting some of their own favorite songs of provocation — and, in some cases, lamentation. Some are obvious, some are shocking. None are subtle. One of the most powerful of all is “Ain’ Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ’Round.” Born in 1956, growing up in Harlem during the 1960s, this song encouraged me through the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War and the Harlem heroin epidemic. — manigroup, Chicago Consider the viral video of Lynzy Lab who created a song after hearing Trump say that we should be afraid for our sons in the MeToo era. She lists all of the things women are afraid to do for fear of sexual assault, but the refrain is ‘It sure is a scary time for boys.’ The song ends with a call to vote and make some noise. — RAR, Los Angeles You’re right, Mr. Wainwright, you have a list full of artifacts. Get with the times. Anti-Flag has been logging more miles and messaging better than anyone the last 20 years. They have been looking out for everyone from Gulf War vets to Pussy Riot. Listen to “Racist” and “When the Wall Falls” and you know they are the ones getting it done. — Sam, Pennsylvania “Strange Fruit,” a lament for the lynched that goes beyond protest. — Rey Buono, Thailand “Which Side Are You On?” was written by Florence Reece, the wife of Sam Reece, a union organizer for the United Mine Workers in Harlan County, Kentucky. This is really a great song. It has been performed by Pete Seeger, the Dropkick Murphys, Natalie Merchant, Ani DiFranco and a lot of other artists. — Bruce Jones, Austin, Tex. As a late Gen Xer, I never heard any of Loudon Wainwright’s song picks live. Personally, I grew up on Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine, but unless we were at a concert, we didn’t sing them in public. — Diego, Forestville Not all protest songs do the same thing. Some seek to inform the listener. Some seek to anger the listener. Others seek to inspire and organize the listener. To my way of thinking, the most effective are those that are aspirational and can be sung by crowds helping to bring people together and motivate them. Mimi Fariña’s “Bread and Roses” certainly fits that bill. — Jim, Boston A protest song is more than a song decrying a social condition, it is one that rouses to action. As such, songs like “Fixin’ to Die Rag” are effective, while those like “Little Piggies” or “Bungalow Bill” by the Beatles skewer without moving to action. “Eve of Destruction,” a jeremiad, was certainly effective if, for nothing else, the backlash that followed its release. — Lawrence Zajac, Williamsburg Oh, it’s much too late for this, Mr. Wainwright. Trump is not some weird aberration, he’s who we are. You want a song that sums up America now? It’s Leonard Cohen’s “Everybody Knows.” — Kaleberg, Port Angeles, Wash. Protest music goes beyond folk and popular music. The anger that the people of New Orleans felt after Hurricane Katrina is on display in Terence Blanchard’s jazz masterpiece “A Tale of God’s Will” and Dr. John’s more pointed “The City That Care Forgot.” Everyone should listen to this music. — CScott, Cincinnati Listen to these songs and other suggestions from readers on our Spotify Protest Playlist.

2018,Opinion | Ready for a Woman as President,"A reader takes issue with some Democratic women who think otherwise. To the Editor: In “Democrats Foresee a Female Front-Runner. Or 3” (front page, Oct. 20), you say that “some Democratic women express doubt that Americans are ready for a female president.” No, and more no! This is the great canard from the 2016 election. In fact, Americans demonstrated their readiness for a woman as they gave Hillary Clinton almost 2.9 million more votes than they gave Donald Trump. Why do we overlook this critical point? We should be constantly reminded that it was the Electoral College that deprived us of the female president we were more than ready for. William DunhamBryn Mawr, Pa.",The New York Times
2018,Real Madrid Offense Hasn’t Been This Futile in More Than 30 Years,"Alavès 1, Real Madrid 0 Real Madrid has not struggled this much to score a goal in more than three decades. A last-gasp goal by host Alavès dealt Real Madrid, the European champion, a 1-0 defeat in La Liga on Saturday, extending Madrid’s scoring drought to four straight games — almost seven hours of game time without finding the net. The last time Madrid went as long without a goal was 1985. And Coach Julen Lopetegui is running out of time to make his attack click without the goals once provided by Cristiano Ronaldo. Madrid has one win in its last five Liga matches, and has gone four matches in all competitions without a victory. “We coaches are exposed to these situations, but we just think about how we can keep working,” Lopetegui said. “We are in October. It is not a good situation, but 10 days ago, it was.” The team’s fortunes have taken a drastic turn since it beat Roma, 3-0, in the Champions League less than two weeks ago. Before Saturday, Madrid lost at Sevilla, 3-0, drew with Atlètico Madrid, 0-0, and fell at CSKA Moscow, 1-0. Madrid center back Sergio Ramos defended Lopetegui, who took over from the hugely successful Zinedine Zidane this summer. Ramos said it would be “crazy” to change managers now, with the team “fighting for position at the top of the table.” He added, “We have to remain calm and try to break this streak.” Amid its drought, Madrid is also dealing with health issues. Forwards Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema had to be substituted during Saturday’s game because of unspecified injuries that Lopetegui said “greatly limited what we could do.” The team was already without the injured backs Marcelo and Dani Carvajal, and Isco is still recovering from surgery for appendicitis. After an international break, Madrid next plays at home against Levante on Oct. 20. It then hosts Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League before visiting Barcelona on Oct. 28. The Alavès substitute Manu Garcìa sent the fans at Mendizorroza Stadium into ecstasy when he headed in a corner kick knocked on by a teammate on the last touch of the game. Alavès had not had a Liga victory over Madrid at home since the 1930-31 season. To make the victory even sweeter, Alavès rose into a tie with with Madrid and Barcelona atop the league standings. Alavès, a small club from the northern Basque Country coached by Abelardo Fernandez, has lost only twice through eight games. “This is going to be one of the best days of my career,” Garcìa, a midfielder and team captain, said. “I am very proud.”",The New York Times
2018,Reality Breaks Up a Saudi Prince Charming’s Media Narrative,"Mediator Just six months ago, American media outlets presented a sunny-side-up portrait of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia as he made a good-will tour of New York, Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Eager journalists captured him at Starbucks with Michael R. Bloomberg, strolling the Google grounds with Sergey Brin and dining with Rupert Murdoch. Built into the narrative was a mostly cheerful acceptance of the story Crown Prince Mohammed was selling about himself — that here, at last, was the modern Middle Eastern leader the West had been waiting for. That story started to crack apart on Oct. 2, when the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a sharp critic of the Saudi government, walked into the country’s consulate in Istanbul and didn’t walk out. Last week, American intelligence officials found supporting evidence for Turkish assessments that Mr. Khashoggi, who lived as an exile in Virginia and wrote opinion columns for The Washington Post, was murdered at the hands of the Saudis, who deny involvement. Fred Ryan, the publisher of The Post, called Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance a likely case of “state-sponsored, cold-blooded murder.” The apparent hit was part of a progression that was underway long before Crown Prince Mohammed’s charm campaign, which made him out to be not some ruthless royal, but a youthful reformer who had granted Saudi women the right to drive and lifted the country’s 35-year ban on movie theaters (a potential jackpot for Hollywood). The rebranding effort also made it easier for United States businesses to tap into the billions the crown prince controlled in the Saudi Public Investment Fund. As it happened, the fund was seeking stakes in the American entertainment and media companies that mint mythologies and own the news. So there was Crown Prince Mohammad at an April soirée at Mr. Murdoch’s vineyard in Bel Air, Calif. Guests included the Walt Disney Company’s chairman, Robert A. Iger; the studio chief at Warner Bros., Kevin Tsujihara; and the actors Morgan Freeman and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who overshared on Instagram that he was “blown away to be told about the level of love the Saudi people have for me.” As the guest of honor at a Page Six-worthy dinner at the producer Brian Grazer’s Santa Monica home, the crown prince discussed Snapchat’s popularity in his kingdom with the Snap chief Evan Spiegel;Vice’s Shane Smith; Amazon’s chief — and Washington Post owner — Jeff Bezos and the agent-turned-mogul Ari Emanuel. Mr. Emanuel, an organizer of the evening, had reason to celebrate: the Saudis planned a $400 million investment in Endeavor, his entertainment holding company. (In light of Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, Endeavor is reassessing the deal, according to a person with knowledge of Mr. Emanuel’s thinking, who shared it only on condition of anonymity.) Vanity Fair noted at the time that the festivities were not marred by talk of civilian deaths in Yemen from Saudi-led airstrikes; the crown prince’s “anti-corruption” move to imprison scores of Saudi businessmen, including the owners of Saudi television networks and key rivals, at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton; or the five-year prison sentence the Saudi royal court handed the journalist Saleh al-Shehi for criticizing the government. The embrace between the American establishment and the leader known as M.B.S. was set to continue in Riyadh later this month at a business conference hosted by Crown Prince Mohammed. The sponsors, partners and participants of the conference — known informally as “Davos In The Desert” — included a number of media companies: CNBC, The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Los Angeles Times, The Financial Times, The Economist, CNN and Fox Business Network. [More business executives have canceled plans to attend the Saudi investment conference.] With the exception of Fox, which is reviewing its participation, all of those organizations pulled out as the Khashoggi story climbed most-viewed article lists and drew cable coverage. The story’s popularity was helped along by its thriller-like qualities, which included the allegation that the journalist’s body was dismembered with the aid of a bone saw before it was removed from the consulate. And suddenly the “M.B.S.” moniker took on a grim new meaning among the plugged-in set of Washington: Mister Bone Saw. There were plenty of reasons for media organizations to avoid the conference before those allegations, however. In January, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that Saudi Arabia’s detention of the critical journalist, Mr. al-Shehi, brought to eight the number of reporters behind bars “amid a widening crackdown in the kingdom,” and there have been more since. Sherif Mansour, the director of the committee’s Middle East and North Africa program, told me he took a dim view of the news media’s more credulous accounts of Crown Prince Mohammed. “We have been beside ourselves,” Mr. Mansour said. He added that the Saudis’ “reform claims were merely a sham.” Not everyone fell for the hype, though. In April, a clear-eyed New Yorker article by Dexter Filkins highlighted the Saudi “crackdown on what remained of the country’s independent press and pro-reform groups.” The story included an ominous quote about the crown prince from Mr. Khashoggi: “He can do whatever he wants now,” he said. “All the checks and balances are gone.” It would have made for jarring reading for anyone whose knowledge of the crown prince came from a glossy magazine called The New Kingdom that mysteriously appeared on newsstands ahead of his visit. It was 100 pages of Saudi cotton candy, filled with splashy photos of the crown prince smiling serenely beneath his checkered headgear here, shaking hands with President Trump there. The publication called him a “decisive leader prepared to back words with action.” The magazine was paid for and produced by American Media Inc., the tabloid news company that helped Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign to cover up his alleged affairs with a former Playboy model and a porn star. A.M.I. said it printed The New Kingdom to capitalize on interest in the crown prince’s visit. A more plausible reason emerged when my colleagues and I reported that the publication coincided with A.M.I.’s efforts to strike business deals in Saudi Arabia, which included a meeting there between the company’s chairman, David Pecker, and M.B.S. himself. None of this is meant to suggest there wasn’t something newsworthy in the crown prince’s moves to reopen theaters and allow women to drive under a more moderate form of Saudi Islam. “I never dreamed I would see that — these are huge deals,’’ said The Times columnist Tom Friedman, who wrote a column praising Crown Prince Mohammad last year, but has also warned that his autocratic side would undercut his efforts if left unchecked. It’s just that there’s a streak in American journalism to allow glittering narratives about budding authoritarians to obscure less appealing facts. It wasn’t too long ago that Bashar al-Assad captured journalists’ imaginations as a next-gen ruler ready to open Syria to American tech. His wife, Asma, landed a gauzy profile in Vogue in 2011 enthusing over the Assads’ “wildly democratic” home life. Yesterday’s reformer is now “the Butcher of Damascus.” There was also the civilian leader of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, a 1991 Nobel Prize winner and, potentially, “the Mandela of Asia,” as CNN reported in 2016. Last week, Myanmar arrested three journalists for critical reporting. That followed the sentencing of two of Reuters reporters to seven years in prison. Crown Prince Mohammad got something last week that those leaders never did — a spot on Vanity Fair’s annual New Establishment List.",The New York Times

2018,Rebel Leader Returns to South Sudan to Mark Peace Deal,"JUBA, South Sudan — The rebel leader Riek Machar returned to the capital, Juba, to celebrate a peace deal on Wednesday, more than two years after fierce fighting erupted in the city and forced him to flee the country. To further reinforce the peace deal, President Salva Kiir ordered the release of a jailed adviser to Mr. Machar, along with a rebel spokesman. Mr. Machar flew in with his wife and a small retinue. He met with Mr. Kiir, his long-time rival, and regional leaders who have pressed the two men to end the civil war. “We need peace,” Mr. Machar told thousands of people who gathered at a ceremony marking the peace accord that he, Mr. Kiir and the leaders of other groups signed last month. South Sudan, the world’s youngest nation, plunged into conflict in 2013 after Mr. Kiir sacked Mr. Machar as vice president. Troops loyal to both men clashed in the capital that December and ethnically charged fighting soon spread, shutting down oil fields, forcing millions to flee and killing hundreds of thousands of people. There has been sporadic fighting since the latest agreement was signed, but violence has died down. Mr. Kiir hosted Wednesday’s ceremony at the same spot where South Sudan’s leaders celebrated independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war fueled by oil, ethnicity and religion. Mr. Machar fled to the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 after fighting broke out again in the capital, wrecking an earlier peace deal and killing hundreds. He later traveled to South Africa, where he was held under house arrest until this year.",The New York Times
2018,Rebels in Congo Kill 15 and Abduct Children in Area of Ebola Outbreak,"JOHANNESBURG — Congolese rebels have killed 15 civilians and abducted a dozen children in an attack in the center of the latest outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, Congo’s military said Sunday. The violence threatened to again force the suspension of efforts to contain the virus. The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo was declared on Aug. 1, and has been centered on North Kivu Province, which borders Uganda and Rwanda. On Friday, the World Health Organization said that there had been 118 confirmed Ebola deaths so far and 35 probably caused by the disease, out of more than 200 cases. It is the 10th outbreak in the country since 1976. Efforts to combat the disease have been complicated by fighting between government forces and armed militias, and by attacks on medical workers. “We condemn this attack,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization. “Everyone should work on achieving peace and fight Ebola.” Rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces attacked Congolese troop positions and several neighborhoods of Beni, a city in northeastern Congo where many new Ebola cases have been reported, on Saturday and into Sunday, Capt. Mak Hazukay Mongha of the Congolese Army said. The United Nations peacekeeping mission said its troops exchanged fire with rebels in the Mayangose area of Beni. Rebels from the group, one of several militias active in Congo’s far northeast, have killed hundreds of civilians in recent years. The group has a history of cross-border fighting with the Ugandan army, attacks on peacekeepers and massacres of civilians. Angry over the killings, Beni residents on Sunday carried four of the bodies to the town hall, where police dispersed them with tear gas. Vehicles of aid organizations and the peacekeeping mission were pelted with stones, Radio Okapi, which is supported by the United Nations, reported. The W.H.O. has said it is “deeply concerned” by the outbreak but that it did not yet warrant being declared a global emergency. To receive that designation, an outbreak must be “an extraordinary event” that might cross borders, requiring a coordinated response. Confirmed cases have been found near the heavily traveled border with Uganda. Congo’s health ministry has reported “numerous aggressions” in the new outbreak against health workers, who have described hearing gunshots daily. Many are operating under the armed escort of United Nations peacekeepers or Congolese security forces, and ending work by sundown to lower the risk of attack. Late last month, containment efforts were suspended for days in Beni after an attack left more than 20 people dead, hindering the work of finding and tracking suspected contacts of infected people. Since then, many of the new confirmed Ebola cases have been reported in Beni as the rate of new cases overall has more than doubled, alarming aid groups. The weekend attacks in the Beni area came after two medical agents with the Congolese army were shot dead — the first time health workers had been killed by rebels in this outbreak. It is a “dark day” for everyone fighting Ebola, Congo’s health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, said late Saturday while announcing the deaths. Mai Mai rebels surged from the forest and opened fire on the unarmed agents with the army’s rapid intervention medical unit at an entrance to Butembo city, the health ministry said. The daytime attack appeared premeditated, with civilians present left unharmed, the statement said. The medical agents had been placed in “dangerous zones” to assist national border health officials. “Our agents will continue to go into the field each day to fulfill the mission entrusted to them,” the health minister said. “We will continue to take all necessary measures so that they can do their job safely.”",The New York Times
2018,Rebuilding After a Hurricane: Why Does It Take So Long?,"It’s not just the repairs, it’s navigating a ‘patchwork’ storm recovery system, applying for federal money and finding a reliable contractor. Six years after Hurricane Sandy, there are still about 2,000 households mired in the rebuilding process. Multiply that number by the tens of thousands of homes across the Southeast following Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and the work ahead looks daunting, to say the least. This is mostly because the United States lacks a unified, permanent national disaster recovery system. Instead, federal agencies work with the affected states, each of which has its own standards and protocols. Other variables include whether homeowners have flood insurance, the solvency and skills of homeowners and contractors and, quite simply, luck and timing. Here is a breakdown of how disaster recovery currently works when it affects your home, as well as issues to look out for. Even though flooding is the most common natural disaster in the United States, there are no legal requirements for homeowners to have flood insurance; standard insurance doesn’t cover flooding. That said, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) calculates that one inch of water in a home can cause $25,000 worth of damage. The federal government does not automatically provide funds for homeowners to rebuild. Register immediately with FEMA. Representatives sometimes go door to door in affected neighborhoods; usually there will be emergency disaster center or mobile office. If you have flood insurance, file a claim. Make sure to photograph the damage of your home in detail. It is best to have before and after shots. [Read this article about the thousands of families who are still rebuilding six years after Hurricane Sandy on Long Island's South Shore] If FEMA makes a major disaster declaration, and the agency says individual assistance will be available, it could provide money for rental and lodging, for instance, and emergency home repairs. The maximum available is $33,000 per household. After a presidential disaster declaration, the U.S. Small Business Administration provides low-interest loans for home repair and property damage of up to $240,000, primarily to creditworthy households. Community Development Block Grant- Disaster Recovery awards are administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to state disaster recovery agencies after a presidential disaster declaration and special Congressional approval. These grants can take years to reach homeowners because of the multiple steps involved. Consumer Protection Laws Are Weak When contractor disputes and fraud issues became an issue in Long Island, it was clear that New York laws were not strong enough, said Melissa Luckman, a law professor and director of Touro Law Center’s Disaster Relief Clinic. A good model, she said, is New Jersey’s Consumer Fraud Act, which has given the state attorney general more authority to go after fraudulent contractors. We Need More Trained Caseworkers About 11,000 homeowners enrolled in the NY Rising program. In 2015, New York’s recovery agency said there were about 131 caseworkers in the state, each one handling between 50 and 200 cases, according to Madhu Beriwal, the chief executive of a disaster management firm that provided staffing, among other vendors, for a period after Sandy. Currently 44 caseworkers oversee close to 2,000 households in New York state. And Lawyers Although there were lawyers who volunteered at FEMA’s disaster recovery center right after Sandy, the demand for legal services continued several years after, said William Friedman, a lawyer and former director for the New York Legal Assistance Group. At first, questions were mostly about applying for aid. But years later, homeowners needed legal representation to appeal bungled flood insurance claims, he said. Also: Local Governments Need to Hire When the rebuilding process starts, local governments need to expand, as more employees are needed to expedite permits for contractors and to field phone calls at consumer affairs offices. The paperwork alone creates a massive backlog at local buildings departments. Earlier this month, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act was passed by Congress and signed into law, which allows state agencies to use FEMA funds for mitigation efforts before a disaster occurs. The law will also enforce and update building codes, streamline the funding application process and stipulate that loans will not count against other monetary benefits.",The New York Times

2018,Recipes for Real Life,"Five Weeknight Dishes Hi and welcome to Five Weeknight Dishes, with recipe ideas for busy people like you. Can I also put in a plug for chicken soup made from scratch? (Don’t worry, this newsletter isn’t sponsored by Big Soup.) On Sunday, I used my electric pressure cooker to make spicy chicken stock, with this Bon Appétit recipe providing inspiration. We’ve had it for dinner off and on all week, adding shredded chicken, rice noodles, jalapeño, sliced squash and a drizzle of Sichuan chile oil. So good. O.K., one more plug: I’m doing a talk on Tuesday evening at the Museum of Food and Drink in New York with the amazing Kate McDermott! Kate is a master pie baker who teaches all over the country, so we’ll be talking about that, but also about her hippie youth on the West Coast of the ’60s and ’70s, and the ways in which the food thinking of that era have become vital again. I’d love to meet you, so if you’re there, please say hello. Or I’m at dearemily@nytimes.com if you just want to send me a note sometime. Here are five dishes for the week: 1. Sheet-Pan Chicken With Shallots and Grapes Don’t you just want to live in a world where dinner looks like this? Serve it with rice, farro, barley or wheat berries — a grain with some heft — and a simple green salad or some carrots you’ve cut into chunks, thrown onto a second pan, tossed with oil and put in the oven to roast to sweetness while the chicken cooks. View this recipe in your weekly plan. _____ 2. Pasta With Bacon, Cheese, Lemon and Pine Nuts I love Julia Moskin’s recipes — they’re delicious and smart and made for real life. This one is modular, a dish built on a pasta base that can be adjusted along the way to please everyone you’re feeding. (And read the story that accompanied this recipe, which lays out her strategy; it is sharply funny and true to the plight of the cook who needs to feed the picky.) Serve with an affable veg everyone likes — maybe green beans, with a little crunch. View this recipe in your weekly plan. _____ 3. Roasted Cauliflower With Feta, Almonds and Olives Cauliflower is perennially satisfying, and the olives and feta deliver a little excitement. You could serve this as a side dish, but with the cheese and nuts it’s filling enough to toss with farro or wild rice, shower with more herbs, and have for dinner. View this recipe in your weekly plan. _____ 4. Cumin-Lime Shrimp With Ginger Lime and cumin are often paired with shrimp; the addition of ginger makes this speedy recipe sing. Pile the shrimp into warm corn tortillas to make tacos, or serve them on a pile of white rice. I’d make a kale salad on the side dressed with lime juice and oil, but steamed broccoli or spinach would also work well. View this recipe in your weekly plan. _____ 5. Mushrooms on Toast Oh, I’d definitely eat this for dinner with a crisp fried egg, and you couldn’t go wrong with a lemony arugula salad on the side. A little cozy, a little Anglo, very fast.

2018,Opinion | Recovering the (Lost) Art of Civility,"Fixes Deepening political divisions in America are spurring acts of extreme violence. What will it take to regain civil discourse that serves common interests? Mr. Bornstein is a co-founder of the Solutions Journalism Network, which supports reporting about responses to social problems. Can anything be done to reduce the acrimony in American society? Recently I spoke with David Fairman, the managing director of the Consensus Building Institute and associate director of the M.I.T.-Harvard Public Disputes Program. For three decades, Mr. Fairman has been helping groups of people — often with long histories of bitter opposition — to get to a place where they can talk respectfully with one another and even find ways to work meaningfully together. Mr. Fairman has had success working on many issues, including human rights, climate change, economic development, education and criminal justice policy. He has the rare talent of envisioning pathways forward through what appear to be intractable conflicts. I asked him to reflect on the divide in America today. David Bornstein: What’s at the core of our polarization today? David Fairman: For many people right now, trying to take the perspective of the other side on divisive political issues feels like giving in — or a betrayal. To get a conversation going within a partisan group about the perspective of the other side takes courageous people within the group who stand up and say, “Listen, you know where I stand, but I want to have a serious conversation among us about what they think and why they think it, and I want to see whether there’s any way to find common ground on anything with them — because I just don’t believe that we’re going to get anywhere if all we do is tell each other that they’re wrong and bad.” D.B.: Why has the problem gotten so intense? D.F.: From the national perspective, politicians in both parties have incentives to mobilize their base with strong rhetoric. For most members of Congress who have safe seats, the biggest worry is a primary challenge, and that will drive you toward the more partisan voters who turn out in primary elections. But it’s not only the electoral machinery. Since the Republicans won back the House of Representatives in 1994, it’s been a much fiercer competition between the two parties than at most times since the Civil War. When you see yourself as the minority party for the long term, you have incentives to cooperate with the majority party to move some parts of your agenda. But when you think that you might win back control soon, there’s a strong incentive to just hold out and fight. On the other hand, when you gain control, you know it might not last, so you want to maximize your wins and use whatever tactics you can to overcome opposition. We’ve seen both parties doing this since the 1990s. And when you play win-lose politics fiercely for more than 20 years, voters adopt that mind-set too — or they become so frustrated that they tune out. There are also deep societal issues at play: demographic shifts, an economy that is changing fast and causing a lot of anxiety, and the culture wars. But we don’t have to have strong partisan divisions on all those issues, and there have been times in our recent history when we haven’t been so divided. D.B.: Is it necessary to understand how we got here? D.F.: It’s important to explore the question, but it’s not always necessary to agree on the answer. We have lots of experience in many contexts — from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to gang violence — that the most important thing is to be able to hear and acknowledge each other’s stories. We can do that without agreeing on exactly what happened or — and this is key — agreeing on whose fault or responsibility it is. In one of the exercises in our Workable Peace Curriculum for high school kids, you have to listen to others tell their story, say what their needs and concerns are, and then tell it back to them — only for accuracy, not to say that you agree with it, but just to see if you really understood what they were saying. And they get to say, “Yeah, you got that right.” Or, “Nope, you missed this.” Then you restate until they’re satisfied. It doesn’t have to be perfect, but it has to be enough for each side to feel that the other understands its view on the history. Without that experience of being heard, people will keep on turning the conversation back to how we got here and who’s at fault, and it’s very hard to move forward. D.B.: So each side needs to be able to listen to the other side so they feel “You understand me.” D.F.: Yes, and not just intellectually, not just devil’s advocate. It’s showing them that you’ve truly been “‘standing in their shoes,” not just saying, “Yes, I understand.” There is some empathic component to the acknowledgment that matters and that people respond to. There was powerful acknowledgment of this in work that our colleagues at the Public Conversations Project did with pro-life and pro-choice advocates in Boston after the murder of two people at abortion clinics here more than 20 years ago. The pro-life and pro-choice folks who came together didn’t change their fundamental view on abortion, but having gone through a process of perspective-taking, they were able to acknowledge each other’s core values and then agree on ways to expand choices for women considering abortion. In some work we did recently on economic mobility, we had an intense negotiation on the issue of paid sick leave. It succeeded because a credible workers’ rights advocate helped other worker representatives see what was at stake for business, and an effective business representative showed other business stakeholders why workers were so focused on this issue. That’s that mind-set that we need. It’s not giving in, it’s trying to get enough perspective on the other side to find a constructive way to meet your interests and theirs. D.B.: What can people do to make a difference with this problem? D.F.: Think about the choices we make as individuals about what news and information and online spaces we go to. Can you get outside your echo chamber enough to actually get curious? Moving from “I know everything about them — they’re jerks” to “I wonder what they’re saying about this” is huge. If the audiences for Fox News and The New York Times took a few minutes each day to look at the other source with real curiosity, I think it would help. A second, much more challenging move is to have serious, difficult conversations with people you know who think differently. There are successful efforts around the country to get people talking across difference on issues. The National Coalition for Dialogue & Deliberation has more than 700 members doing this work, mainly at the community level. Right now, towns, cities and regions may offer the best spaces for people to talk about divisive public issues — like public education, zoning and development, creating economic opportunities and protecting the environment. These place-based issues create a clear, relevant focus for participation and dialogue. People care because they see how they are directly affected. Then, if local government and civic groups are motivated and capable, they can create public forums that have some authority and legitimacy. The third ingredient is good process design and facilitation — people who can actually make that conversation constructive. When you get those ingredients — relevant issues, legitimate public space and good process — we see excellent public problem solving on many issues, like the work we’ve been doing on groundwater management in Salinas, Calif. And despite the polarization challenges, there are also windows of opportunity at the national level. Organizations like our excellent partner Convergence are able to bring diverse stakeholders together for dialogue on education, health care, criminal justice and economic mobility. ­­One big area of challenge and opportunity is discourse on social media platforms. We know that we’ve got major problems with polarized echo chambers on social media. But there are some efforts, like the one being undertaken by Social Science One with Facebook. We need to figure out the scope of the problem, where user education and action can have an impact, where we may need stronger enforcement of the platforms’ own rules and where there might be some scope for extending regulations about political messages to social media. There may also be some technology solutions still to come. I’d love to find a way to build an app for perspective-taking that would take off like Angry Birds. D.B.: What about political leaders themselves? Could they become less polarizing? D.F.: It’s possible. I wonder if there are some states where Democratic and Republican Party leaders would be willing to host cross-party conversations — not in the heat of the electoral cycle, but after it. Those conversations would be challenging, but they could be structured with an agreed set of questions that both parties say they want to explore together. They could pick a few public issues that matter in the state, and perhaps later look at national issues. Then, in cities and towns across the state, groups of no more than a dozen — half from each party — could meet over dinner, maybe once a month for six months. They could feed back the main points of their conversations to the state level, where they’d be reviewed by party leaders, who would also be in regular, private conversation with each other. After six months, or longer if it seemed useful, there could be some public reflection and discussion. I’m confident that a process like that with some design and facilitation from people who are independent could bring the partisan heat down, build relationships and make it harder to demonize each other, even if it didn’t lead to agreement on the issues. Party machinery matters. It works. It’s not hard for them to deliver activists to a room if they decide they really want to do this. D.B.: I’m envisioning the typical articles next month, like “Will Brett Kavanaugh ruin your family’s Thanksgiving?” What advice would you offer? D.F.: If you know there’s going to be a strong partisan division at the table and you really want to spend time on that issue, I’d suggest finding a constructive question to start the conversation. “Should Kavanaugh have been confirmed?” is probably not going to take you to a good place. “What did you learn from the Kavanaugh confirmation process?” could be more interesting. And once you hear a response from the other side, try to make your first follow-up be something like: “That’s interesting. Tell me more about that.” Go deeper, and try to stay curious. Some organizations and projects that focus on supporting civil dialogue: Ask Big Questions works on college campuses. Better Angels brings together Americans across political divides. Center for Nonviolent Communication works globally. Center for Whole Communities works at the individual, organizational and community levels. Civil Conversations Project (conversations from episodes of On Being, hosted by Krista Tippett). Civity cultivates respect and empathy across difference. Essential Partners focuses on conflicts driven by differences in identity, beliefs and values. Everyday Democracy supports community dialogue.

Interfaith Youth Core helps people of different faiths and traditions find common values and purpose. National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation is a network of groups that bring people together across fault lines. National Institute for Civil Discourse works with elected officials, media and the public. Resetting the Table builds dialogue about charged issues among people with diverse viewpoints, some of whom may feel skeptical, dismissive or estranged. Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom builds relationships between Muslim and Jewish women. Spaceship Media convenes people across divides and curates respectful online conversations. The Village Square works at the community level. Some organizations focused on conflict resolution and consensus building: CDR Associates specializes in collaborative decision making in high-conflict scenarios.

2018,Red Bulls Clinch M.L.S. Regular-Season Title,"Roundup The Red Bulls edged visiting Orlando City on Sunday to claim the Supporters’ Shield as Major League Soccer’s regular-season champion. The Red Bulls took advantage of a rare stumble by first-place Atlanta United to leapfrog Atlanta in the standings and claim the top seed in the playoffs on a wild final day that also saw one of the league’s biggest stars, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, miss out on the postseason when his Los Angeles Galaxy blew a two-goal lead and lost at home. The Red Bulls’ 1-0 victory over last-place Orlando and Atlanta United’s 4-1 humbling at Toronto, which missed the playoffs after winning the M.L.S. championship last season, gave the team its third Supporters’ Shield in six years and set a league record for most points in the regular season, with 71. The Red Bulls also won the Shield, awarded by fans to the team with the league’s best record in the regular season, in 2013 and 2015. Derrick Etienne scored the only goal for the Red Bulls, atoning for a missed penalty kick in the first half by slotting in a low shot in the 53rd minute. Dribbling left in the penalty area, Etienne dropped his defender by pulling the ball back to his right and firing a shot inside the right post. It was his fifth goal this season. The Red Bulls (22-7-5) finished the regular season with five straight wins and a league-record 71 points, two more than Atlanta. They are the first M.L.S. team to compile 70 points in the regular season but are still seeking their first M.L.S. championship. The team, a founding franchise in M.L.S., has reached the title game only once, losing to Columbus in 2008. But Sunday’s win offered renewed hope that this, once again, could be the year. “We are going after M.L.S. Cup,” Coach Chris Armas told exuberant fans at Red Bull Arena after the team’s latest milestone victory. “After 23 years, we are going after it.” The Red Bulls and Atlanta United each earned a first-round bye in the Eastern Conference playoffs. In the Western Conference, Sporting Kansas City beat Los Angeles F.C., 2-1, to hold off Seattle atop the conference standings. The Galaxy, which had hoped to claim the West’s final playoff spot with a win over Houston on their home field, seemed on their way when they took a 2-0 lead on two first-half goals by Ola Kamara. But Houston rallied with three goals after the break, and the loss allowed idle Real Salt Lake to claim the sixth spot in the West. In Toronto, Atlanta United’s Josef Martinez scored on a penalty kick — his league-record 31st goal this season — to wrap up the M.L.S. scoring title. But Lucas Jansson (twice), Marky Delgado and Sebastian Giovinco scored for Toronto, allowing the 2017 league champions to end a frustrating season on a high note. New York City F.C. clinched the third seed in the East with a 3-1 victory over visiting Philadelphia. Within the first 10 minutes, a Maxime Chanot header and a Philadelphia own goal staked N.Y.C.F.C. to a 2-0 lead. The day only got worse for the Union from there, as their goal scorer, Cory Burke, and his teammate Borek Dockal had to be separated after exchanging angry words after the halftime whistle. The M.L.S. playoffs open with elimination games on Wednesday and Thursday. In the East, the matchups were an N.Y.C.F.C.-Philadelphia rematch at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday and fifth-seeded Columbus at No. 4 D.C. United on Thursday. The Red Bulls and Atlanta United will play the winners in two-leg series that begin on Sunday. In the West, third-seeded L.A.F.C. will host Salt Lake on Thursday and fourth-seeded F.C. Dallas will play the Portland Timbers on Wednesday. Kansas City and Seattle will await the winners; their second-round series also will begin Sunday, with the second legs of each on Nov. 11. The two-leg conference championship series begin Nov. 25, after the next FIFA international break. M.L.S. Cup is set for Dec. 8, at the stadium of the finalist with the highest regular-season point total.",The New York Times
2018,Red Sox Emerge From a Chaotic Day With Commanding Lead in A.L.C.S.,"Red Sox 8, Astros 6 | Boston leads series, 3-1 HOUSTON — On a day riddled with controversies and accusations over spying and illicit cameras, one notable illness and loads of offense, it was somehow fitting that four and a half hours of thrilling baseball would come down to one final, nerve-racking defensive play. Of course, the bases were loaded with two outs in the ninth inning. And of course at the plate was Alex Bregman, the Astros lightning-rod star with the thunderous bat, hoping to win the game with one well-placed swing. And most fitting of all, the Astros — who felt they had been robbed of a two-run home run by an umpire’s controversial call early in the game — were also trailing by two runs in the ninth against Craig Kimbrel, Boston’s shaky closer. [Interference or Not? Both sides weigh in on the controversy] With the suspense inside Minute Maid Park already at peak level and fans barely able to watch, Bregman did not wait. He swung at the first pitch and lashed a sinking line drive into left field. It was a dangerous ball and the game hung in the balance as Andrew Benintendi, Boston’s left fielder, sprinted forward for the all-or-nothing play. Jackie Bradley Jr., who hit another big home run for Boston, watched helplessly from center field as the play unfolded, hoping along with legions of Red Sox fans around the country that his teammate would avert a sporting disaster. “I started seeing Benny running in,” Bradley recalled, “I see him leave his feet, and I was like, ‘Just don’t get by him, just don’t get by him. Lock it up, lock it up.’” If the ball got past Benintendi and rolled to the wall, the Astros could have scored three runs and won the game to even the American League Championship Series at two games apiece. Benintendi had to catch it. With all eyes upon him, Benintendi sprinted forward and dove to make the catch. As he slid, he held up the glove to show the umpires his handiwork and confirm the catch, then leapt to his feet to celebrate. Four hours and 33 minutes after the first pitch, Boston held on to beat the Astros, 8-6, grabbing a commanding three-games-to-one lead in the playoffs. “I can’t recall being more excited about a catch in my life,” said Benintendi, who received a kiss on the cheek from his teammate Brock Holt for his heroics. For Houston, it was the opposite feeling. Jose Altuve called it “a five-star catch, and it cost us the game.” But he and the Astros also felt they were the victims of a bad ruling by Joe West, the umpire on the right field line, who ruled that a fan had interfered with Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts as he tried to make a leaping catch of Altuve’s fly ball in the first inning. The Astros insisted it was a home run, but West ruled it an out, and a lengthy video replay upheld his call, much to Altuve’s dismay. “Two runs,” Altuve said. “The game ended up by two runs, so that makes me a little more upset.” The Red Sox now need only one more victory to dethrone the defending World Champions and capture their 14th American League pennant and a trip to the World Series. Out of necessity, they will turn to David Price, who has never won a postseason start, to pitch Game 5 on short rest against Houston’s ace, Justin Verlander. Price was warming up in the bullpen Wednesday and probably would have been called in had Benintendi not made the catch. He pitched Game 2 on Sunday and was slated for a potential Game 6. But Chris Sale, Boston’s scheduled starter for Game 5, was scratched before Wednesday’s game because he was still too weak after being hospitalized on Sunday for a stomach illness. “He’s feeling better compared to yesterday, but physically he’s not there yet,” Red Sox Manager Alex Cora said. “So I think, if necessary, he’ll pitch Game 6. He feels that he’ll be ready for that one.” The other big topic of conversation before Game 4 was the announcement by Major League Baseball that it had concluded an investigation — with no penalty — into whether the Astros had tried to steal signs against the Red Sox in Game 1 at Fenway Park, prompting discussion about whether Houston uses special cameras at Minute Maid Park to steal other teams’ signs, which the Astros deny. It was a messy distraction, but once the game got rolling it was largely forgotten amid the controversial non-home run call and another offensive onslaught from the Red Sox, who became the first team to score eight runs in consecutive games at Minute Maid Park this year. In the bottom of the first, Altuve lifted a long fly ball off Boston’s starter, Rick Porcello, with George Springer on first base. As the ball soared to deep right field, Betts jumped for the ball. His arm rose above the wall and his glove made contact with the hand of a fan who was also reaching for the ball, closing Betts’s glove and preventing him from making the catch. The ball bounced back into the field, but West immediately called Altuve out for fan interference. Altuve threw up his hands at second base, and the Astros requested a video replay review, hoping for a reversal of fortune that would tie the score, or at least put the runners at second and third. If replays clearly showed that Betts had reached beyond the wall into the seating area, it would not have been interference. “The spectator reached out of the stands and hit him over the playing field and closed his glove,” West told a pool reporter. According to Rule 6.01(e) of Major League Baseball’s rule book, “No interference shall be allowed when a fielder reaches over a fence, railing, rope or into a stand to catch a ball. He does so at his own risk. However, should a spectator reach out on the playing field side of such fence, railing or rope, and plainly prevent the fielder from catching the ball, then the batsman should be called out for the spectator’s interference.” After a delay of three minutes and 13 seconds, during which the fans chanted “Home run” over and over, the initial ruling was confirmed. Altuve was out and Springer had to go back to first. Houston did not score in that inning. “That was a clear home run,” fumed Astros outfielder Josh Reddick, who would make a run-saving diving catch in the ninth as well. Houston did take the lead, 5-4, in the sixth. But Bradley, who had hit a grand slam in Game 3 and a three-run double in Game 2, blasted a two-run homer that gave it back to Boston. They added two insurance runs and turned it over to Kimbrel, who earned his first six-out save — barely. In the ninth, Kimbrel walked three batters before Benintendi’s terrific two-out catch, leaving the margin of victory at two runs. After the game, Astros Manager A.J. Hinch was asked about West’s controversial call and whether more cameras along the perimeter of the wall might help with the replay review. That was all he needed to hear. “Yeah, earlier we started the day with, do we have too many cameras in the park?” he said. “I wish we had an angle that was perfectly along the line that would show it. That’s the one camera we don’t have.”",The New York Times
2018,"Red Sox Fans, With a Title to Cheer, Choose the Yankees to Jeer","On Baseball It did not take long for Red Sox supporters to get to the core of the matter. Within minutes of their team’s cementing its status as one of the best baseball clubs ever, fans at Dodger Stadium — in Los Angeles — began a seemingly incongruous chant. “Yankees suck. Yankees Suck.” Huh? What did the Yankees have to do with it? They had not played a game in nearly three weeks, since the Red Sox dispatched them in their American League division series. Yet with all that joy and euphoria derived from winning the World Series on Sunday night, the happy fans celebrated by disparaging a team that was not even involved. It may sound weird, but it is actually understandable once you recognize the little-sibling mentality of Boston fans vis a vis New York. For Red Sox fans, it is always about the Yankees, and that is the way it should be. If we celebrate the so-called best rivalry in sports, then it should endure even when the teams are not actually playing each other. That is how all-encompassing a rivalry should be. And it is not a one-way street. During the Yankees’ celebration after they won their 27th World Series in 2009, fans were heard on a street corner chanting, “Bawston sucks.” This perpetual David-and-Goliath bout goes back and forth with regular swings of the bat. Sunday’s anti-Yankees chant in Los Angeles was by no means the first. It was heard the night before, during Game 3, too. But there were good reasons for it, besides just decades of jealousy and resentment. First, it would have been too long-winded to chant about winning more games in the regular season (108) than any other team. It doesn’t roll off the tongue and it has no sense of humor. And an anti-Dodgers chant has no juice, either. What, Red Sox fans are supposed to still harbor animosity from the 1916 World Series (which Boston won, anyway)? After the kind of season the Red Sox just had — including beating out the Yankees by eight games in the A.L. East and romping through a postseason that ended with their four-games-to-one beatdown of the Dodgers in the World Series — most normal fans would have filed out singing triumphantly, “We are the Champions,” and nobody could have argued. The players in their victory celebration in the locker room even took a cue from the fans. Red Sox players sang all right, but it was “New York, New York,” which is boomed through Yankee Stadium after a game. It was a return jab at Aaron Judge, the Yankees star who played the song at Fenway Park after the Yankees won their only game of their division series. But this goes back much longer than a few weeks ago. This is about Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Bucky Dent and Aaron Boone (that is, Aaron Freaking Boone), and more. The overall inferiority complex Bostonians feel in regard to New York is centuries old, but it is not reciprocated off the playing field. Outside of sports, New Yorkers generally don’t care much what happens in Boston. Here is all you need to know to explain the differences between the cities: The last two New York City mayors grew up in the Boston area and are fans of the Red Sox (they were both re-elected too, despite the local news media poking fun at their roots and sports allegiances). That could never — in 100,000 years — happen in reverse. No way a New Yorker would ever become mayor of Boston, unless he or she publicly renounced the Yankees and forced Dunkin’ Donuts to give out free crullers in perpetuity. Not that Red Sox fans can’t get along with a segment of New Yorkers. During a series in September at Fenway against the Mets this year, fans of both teams united in their one core belief, that the “Yankees suck.” The pain for both is deep. For many years, Yankees fans crushed the souls of Red Sox fans with chants of “1918,” a cruel reminder that the Red Sox had not won a World Series since that year, in part because the Red Sox sold Ruth to the Yankees. All Red Sox fans could come up with in retort was, “Yankees suck.” As juvenile as it was, it fit the mood nicely and it stuck because for a long time, the only way Bostonians could get back at the Yankees was by proxy. They had the Celtics and the Patriots, who did so much for the self-esteem of New Englanders before 2004. So, of course, during the Pats’ championship parade in Boston after their first Super Bowl championship in 2002 — something their fans had waited 42 seasons for, guess what they chanted? But they also chanted it this year during the Patriots game against the Indianapolis Colts in Foxborough, Mass. on Oct. 4. We also heard it four days later at TD Garden during a hockey game between the Bruins and the Ottawa Senators, the day the Red Sox clobbered the Yankees, 16-1, in Game 3. “They had a terrific season,” said one Yankees official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to further stoke the rivalry. “It just shows how we are in their psyche. No matter what they do, they always compare themselves to the big boys down south.” The chant certainly reflects that old sentiment. Meanwhile, the Red Sox’ championship parade — their fourth this century — is Wednesday. You can bet your next cruller what you will hear.",The New York Times
2018,Red Sox Have Little Choice but to Believe David Price Is Due,"BOSTON — While the Boston Red Sox were still hugging, dancing and celebrating on the Yankee Stadium infield last week, Manager Alex Cora took David Price aside and told him something that would have appalled some fans of the team. Regardless of Price’s woeful record as a starting pitcher in the postseason, and his poor start just three days before, Cora told Price he was giving him the ball again. Price said he had expected to start again this postseason, but hearing it so soon meant it was not something that Cora had to mull over and debate. The manager believed in him, even if the fans did not. “Alex told me before we even got off the field that night,” Price said. “For him to tell me before we even took our jerseys off to put on our postseason shirts that we get when we win, that was special.” But for Cora, a first-year manager, it was a simple calculus. He believes that if the Red Sox are going to win the American League Championship Series and then capture a World Series title, they have to show faith in Price, who may be the most overdue pitcher in the history of postseason baseball. An elite starter in the regular season, Price has repeatedly gone astray in October, and his four teams have lost all 10 of his postseason starts. Price has two playoff wins in relief, but his record in postseason starts is 0-9 with a 6.18 earned run average, and he has surrendered 13 home runs in those 10 games. It is an unambiguous pattern, but Cora said he trusted Price to finally change his fate on Sunday, in Game 2 of the A.L. Championship Series against the Houston Astros. If Price cannot break the pattern, Cora’s choice could mean doom for the Red Sox, especially since they already lost Game 1. “I do feel that there’s a few things that got away from him the last few starts,” Cora said. “And we do feel that in Game 2 he’ll get back to attack the hitters in a certain way. That’s the beauty of David.” Now more is at stake than Price’s postseason reputation. If he fails again and the Red Sox do not advance to the World Series, the decision could haunt Cora and the Boston front office for years. Cora could have opted to put Price in the bullpen, where he has largely been effective in the payoffs, and start Nathan Eovaldi or Rick Porcello in Game 2. But that could leave the Red Sox scrambling for a Game 4 starter, or opting for the risky bullpen strategy — employing many relievers including Price, their most expensive pitcher. But relegating him to the bullpen for a second straight year could affect Price’s self-confidence and jeopardize the Red Sox’ long-term investment in him. Price came to Boston in 2016 after signing a seven-year, $217 million contract, and the last three years have not gone smoothly. The low point came a year ago when he verbally accosted Dennis Eckersley — a former Red Sox pitcher who is now one of their broadcasters, as well as a fan favorite — on the team plane over comments Eckersley had made about the Sox. Compounding the issue, Price did not pitch well that year, and he was relegated to the bullpen. This year, he had problems with nerves in his pitching hand, which prompted speculation about the effects of Price’s video-game habits and about his reaction to cold weather. But Price pitched well this season: He compiled a 16-7 record with a 3.58 E.R.A., and in the second half of the season went 6-1 with a 2.25 E.R.A. His one loss in that period came at Yankee Stadium in September, where a few fans of the home team taunted him with chants of “Who’s your daddy?” But Boston fans have also jeered Price at times, even though he said he felt only the love, now. “They’ve supported me the entire year,” he said. “I feel like it’s been good.” But his overall success in the regular season will mean little on Sunday if he performs the way he did in Game 2 of the division series against the Yankees at Fenway Park. Price recorded only five outs, surrendering two home runs and three runs over all. But Cora noted that Price has pitched much better against the Astros, and might have been Boston’s best option out of the bullpen in last year’s playoffs against Houston, which eliminated the Red Sox in a division series. Price relieved in two games, pitching six and two-thirds innings over all without allowing a run. Over his career, Price is 6-2 with a 2.94 E.R.A. against Houston. “I like his matchup against the Astros, obviously,” said Chris Sale, Boston’s Game 1 starter. “He’s pitched well against them the last couple of years. And he was the only reason we had a chance last year in the playoffs against Houston. So I like where we’re at.” Price has other supporters besides Sale, Cora and the Red Sox front office that invested so heavily in him. Justin Verlander, the Astros ace, pitched alongside Price for the Detroit Tigers in 2014 and 2015, and the two remain good friends. Verlander attributed Price’s postseason numbers to something like an extended fluke. “I do find that odd,” he said. “Honestly, I hope the trend continues for the short term.” On July 30, 2015, Price was traded by the Tigers to the Toronto Blue Jays, where another manager showed faith in him. John Gibbons, who recently stepped down as Toronto’s manager, said that Price was a totally selfless player when they were together. He said Price volunteered, unsolicited, to pitch out of the bullpen when the Blue Jays lost their only left-handed reliever, Brett Cecil, to injury in a division series against the Texas Rangers. “He came to me and said, ‘Skip, I can do whatever you need, just let me know,’” Gibbons said. “I’ll never forget that. A lot of guys wouldn’t make that offer, but he did. I love the guy.” Gibbons used Price in relief of R.A. Dickey in Game 4, and recorded the win. But some wondered whether Gibbons turned to Price in Game 4 so he would not be available to start Game 5. Gibbons called that theory nonsense. “Not true at all,” Gibbons said. “We just needed him in the pen.” After Toronto won that series, it moved on to the A.L.C.S., against the Kansas City Royals, and like Cora, Gibbons showed his faith and returned Price to the rotation. Price started Games 2 and 6 and gave up eight earned runs in 13⅓ innings, and Kansas City won both games and the series. Gibbons acknowledged that the postseason losing trend must affect Price, at least mentally. “He can’t get away from it,” Gibbons said. “Everyone reminds him of it, and he knows the situation. But he’s still one of their big dogs, and he does well against Houston. If they are going to win it, they need Dave.” Price has one more thing going for him against Houston. He has a French bulldog named Astro. According to the Baseball Reference website, Price’s nickname is Astro’s Dad. Cora and the Red Sox are gambling that Price makes that even more true in Game 2.",The New York Times
2018,Red Sox Reach World Series With David Price’s Playoff Breakthrough,"HOUSTON — On the nights before David Price starts a baseball game, he usually envisions himself on the mound executing good pitches to dangerous batters. But as he prepared to go to sleep the night before Game 5 of the American League Championship Series, knowing he had never won a postseason start before, Price took a new approach. He skipped past the images of nasty pitches and frustrated hitters and went right to the postgame celebration. “My last thought before I went to bed was a little different,” he said as he stood in the victorious Boston Red Sox clubhouse, wiping champagne from his eyes. “Last night I envisioned myself doing this right here, going through my head what I was going to say and how happy I’d be doing it.” In arguably the best game of his life, Price led the Red Sox to a 4-1 victory over the Houston Astros in Game 5 of the A.L.C.S., to clinch the series, four games to one, and capture the team’s 14th American League pennant. It was the first time in his 11-year career that Price, a 33-year-old left-hander, won a postseason start. “It’s one of the most special days I’ve ever had on the baseball field,” he said. His next start will be in the 2018 World Series, against either the Los Angeles Dodgers or the Milwaukee Brewers, beginning on Tuesday at Fenway Park. Whatever happens, a new World Series winner will be crowned because the defending champion Astros were simply overwhelmed by the Red Sox. Houston won the first game at Fenway Park but the rampaging Red Sox won the next four, including the final three at Houston’s Minute Maid Park. They also won the two road games of their previous playoff series against the Yankees in the Bronx, and are 7-2 over all in the A.L. playoffs against two 100-win teams. “They took it to us,” Houston Manager A.J. Hinch said. He added, “They never stop coming at you. They are a relentless group.” Jackie Bradley Jr., who drove in nine runs in the series, was named Most Valuable Player of the A.L.C.S., but in Game 5 the offense came from J.D. Martinez, who hit a solo home run in the third inning off the Astros starter Justin Verlander, and Rafael Devers, who slammed a three-run shot off Verlander in the sixth. Verlander has a reputation as a clutch postseason pitcher, but he was out-dueled by Price, whose reputation was much the opposite. In 11 previous postseason starts, Price was 0-9 and his teams had lost 10 of those games. In Game 2 of the A.L.C.S. on Sunday, the Red Sox became the first team to win a postseason game that Price started, although he did not earn the win in that game. He called it “baby steps,” at the time, and on Thursday said that Game 5 was, “a real step.” He went six innings, allowed three hits and no walks, and struck out nine batters with 93 pitches, and he was doing it all on short rest. Price started Game 2 in Boston on Sunday and was originally scheduled to make his next start in Game 6, if it happened. But when Chris Sale, Boston’s ace, got sick on Sunday, Manager Alex Cora asked Price to fill in on three days of rest, instead of the usual four, for Game 5. Price also threw 40 pitches in the bullpen during Game 4, so with the short rest and workload from the night before, there was some uncertainty about how effective he would be. But he answered those questions emphatically early on by striking out two batters in the first inning, including Carlos Correa, who was left looking at a 91-mile-per-hour cut fastball to end that frame. Houston’s first baseman, Yuli Gurriel, doubled in the fourth, but Price struck out Marwin Gonzalez for his third strikeout of that inning and his seventh of the game. In the fifth, he set down the Astros in order, getting another strikeout and putting himself in position to earn the win. The last batter he faced was Jose Altuve, whom he struck out with an 87-mile-per-hour changeup. “He showed up tonight,” said Andrew Benintendi, the Red Sox left fielder. “He went out there on short rest with all of that stuff and shoved. It was fun to watch.” After Price left the game, Cora, a first-year manager who celebrated his 43rd birthday on Thursday with a pennant, turned the ball over to Matt Barnes and Nathan Eovaldi for the seventh and eighth innings. Then Cora called on Craig Kimbrel, the closer who pitched two innings the night before. Kimbrel was not sharp in that game and had it not been for Benintendi’s game-ending diving catch with the bases loaded, the Red Sox might have lost. But Cora said the Red Sox had discovered that Kimbrel was tipping his pitches for about two weeks, meaning that opponents could tell which pitch he was about to throw. Kimbrel fixed the problem and with one runner on base and two outs Thursday, he induced a long fly ball from Tony Kemp. Benintendi went all the way back to the warning track and caught the ball. The Red Sox began to jump and hug one another in celebration of their 13th World Series appearance in franchise history and fourth this century. Of all the celebrants in the clubhouse, Price seemed the happiest. He has had a tumultuous three years in Boston, where many fans view him negatively, in large part due to his lack of postseason success. But as teammates continued to douse him with champagne, Price could barely contain his glee that he would no longer be asked about never winning a postseason start. “I don’t have to prepare myself for it in spring training, on Feb. 24 or when September rolls around and I’ve still got five regular season starts to go,” he said. “I don’t have to answer that question anymore.” For Price, it was like a vision come to life.",The New York Times
2018,Red Sox Rebound to Defeat Dodgers in World Series Game 4,"Red Sox 9, Dodgers 6 | Boston leads series, 3-1. LOS ANGELES — Chris Sale, the Boston Red Sox star pitcher, was furious. He did not appear in Game 4 of the World Series on Saturday, or in the previous game: a record-setting seven-hour, 20-minute affair that ended in a Boston loss. But Sale may have influenced his team as much as any player this weekend. When the Dodgers’ Yasiel Puig hit what felt like a backbreaking homer that left the Red Sox trailing by 4-0 in the sixth inning of Game 4, Sale lit into his teammates with an expletive-filled rant. [Red Sox vs. Dodgers: Follow our live coverage of World Series Game 5] At one point, he waved two fingers, illustrating that Rich Hill, the Dodgers starting pitcher who was shutting Boston down, had a limited arsenal of pitches. Yet the Red Sox, who had the majors’ best offense during the regular season, were sluggish, particularly their star hitters. “Oh my God, he was mad at us,” Red Sox second baseman Brock Holt said. Third baseman Rafael Devers added, “I’d never seen him yelling like that before.” Perhaps it was a coincidence, but soon after that tirade, the Red Sox roared to life — fueled by the bats of role players like Mitch Moreland, Steve Pearce, Holt and Devers — and outlasted the Dodgers for a 9-6 win. It left the Red Sox one victory away from their fourth World Series title in 15 seasons. A pinch-hit home run by Moreland brought them within one run in the seventh inning. Another blast, by Pearce in the eighth, tied the score. Then, finally, a pinch-hit single by Devers in the ninth put the Red Sox ahead, and Pearce added a Dodger Stadium-silencing bases-clearing double. Entering the game, the Dodgers were 54-0 when leading by four runs or more in 2018. But once the Red Sox start hitting, they can accomplish rareties. On Saturday they became the second team in World Series history to hit game-tying home runs in the eighth inning or later in consecutive games. The other was the 2001 Yankees. “One thing about our team, we keep playing,” Alex Cora, the Red Sox manager, said. “It’s been like that the whole time. We know that in the last third of the game we’ve been really good throughout the season, in the playoffs, and Mitch with a big swing and that got us going.” It simply took a while to get there. Given the ravaged state of both teams’ pitching staffs after the Game 3 marathon, neither manager announced a starting pitcher for Game 4 until Saturday afternoon. Eduardo Rodriguez had appeared in Game 3 for the Red Sox, but he faced only one batter and threw just six pitches. So Cora asked him to take the mound again a day later, but for much longer. The Dodgers toyed with the idea of using an “opener,” a growing trend in baseball that involves starting the game with a relief pitcher, based on matchups, and then replacing him with a traditional starter capable of throwing more innings. But they eventually opted against the tactic, thinking that taking Hill out of his usual routine outweighed any potential matchup advantages. For what it was worth, Hill was one of the Dodgers’ two pitchers who did not appear in Game 3, so he was well rested. Rodriguez, throwing harder than usual, and Hill, vexing batters with his ability to change speeds, dueled for five innings. The Dodgers broke through in the sixth inning, when Justin Turner scored on an error by Red Sox catcher Christian Vazquez, who made an ill-advised throw to first base. Rodriguez, a left-hander, might have been tiring and due for an exit, but Puig, despite being a right-handed batter, has been more successful against right-handed pitching. So Cora left Rodriguez in. “I pushed him too hard,” Cora said after the game. When Rodriguez fell behind and threw a 92 mile-per-hour fastball down the middle of the plate, Puig did not miss. Soon after making contact, he flipped his bat and threw both arms in the air. As he rounded the bases, Puig blew kisses toward the stands and flexed his arms. Rodriguez’s reaction was, understandably, exactly the opposite. After slamming his glove on the ground, he hunched over in distress until his manager came to retrieve him from the mound. A half-inning later, Sale’s fury still in their ears, the Red Sox trimmed their deficit to one. A Dodgers pitching move may have helped even more than the lecture. After six stout innings, Hill walked Xander Bogaerts to lead off the seventh and then struck out Eduardo Nunez. At that point, Dave Roberts, the Dodgers manager, curiously hooked Hill, who left the field to a standing ovation. After the game, Roberts explained that Hill had made an unusual request: instructing his manager to keep a close eye on him in that frame because he was tiring. “He did everything to put us in a position to win a baseball game,” Roberts said. “We’ve got to do a better job of picking him up.” Soon the Dodgers’ mistakes were magnified. Relief pitcher Scott Alexander walked his lone batter, Brock Holt. Though he has not inspired confidence lately, the right-handed reliever Ryan Madson got the call for his fourth appearance of this series. After Roberts turned to Madson, Cora deployed back-to-back left-handed pinch-hitters. Facing Moreland, Madson threw a subpar changeup that ended up deep in the right-field pavilion for a three-run homer. Puig, in right field, put his hands on his head, almost mirroring the anguish he had caused Rodriguez. Clinging to a one-run lead, the Dodgers called on closer Kenley Jansen to pitch the eighth inning against the heart of the Red Sox order. And for the second straight game, Jansen gave up a game-tying home run. In Game 3, it was to Jackie Bradley Jr. In Game 4, it was to Pearce — a solo blast to left-center field. Jansen’s face bore a nervous expression when Pearce made contact. Pearce held one arm up in the air as he ran around the bases. Pearce’s hit ended an 0-for-41 streak by Boston’s No. 1 to four hitters since the start of Game 3. “Obviously, we’ve got some M.V.P.-type guys on our team,” Moreland said, referring to Mookie Betts and J.D. Martinez, who each are hitting under .215 this series. “But it’s taken all 25 of us to get where we are today.” In the ninth inning, the Red Sox once again took advantage of the Dodgers’ bullpen and Roberts’s maneuvers. With Holt on second base, Devers poked a run-scoring single to center off Dylan Floro to give the Red Sox a 5-4 lead. With the bases loaded, Roberts brought in Kenta Maeda to face Pearce, who cleared the bases with a double. Bogaerts then drove Pearce home for a 9-4 lead. It was enough to withstand a shaky bottom of the ninth by Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel, who allowed the Dodgers to trim Boston’s lead to three runs. After the game, Cora made the unusual announcement that David Price would start Game 5 on short rest, not Sale on regular rest, as planned. Roberts insisted it was because the Red Sox liked the matchup. Sale may still be a factor of another kind. Asked about his tongue-lashing, Cora quipped, “My English is very limited, so I didn’t understand what he was saying.” Devers, though, told reporters in the postgame news conference that he had understood Sale’s oration perfectly. “But I can’t say it here,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Red Sox Thrash Yankees in a Humiliating Home Defeat,"Red Sox 16, Yankees 1 What began as a rambunctious crowd at Yankee Stadium — mockingly cheering David Price during introductions and roaring just before the first pitch — found itself transitioning through several stages of grief on Monday night. First came anxiety, followed by despair, which gave way to disbelief and anger and, finally, resignation. The Boston Red Sox sent the capacity crowd into a downward spiral and an early exit, clubbing Yankees starter Luis Severino and taking advantage of Manager Aaron Boone’s indecisiveness to score seven runs in the fourth inning and blast the Yankees, 16-1, to take a two-games-to-one lead in the American League division series. [Yankees vs. Red Sox: Follow our live coverage of Game 4 here] When it was all over, one of the most anticipated games in recent memory for the Yankees had ended in embarrassment: in an all-but-empty stadium with backup catcher Austin Romine on the mound. Instead of seizing control of the best-of-five series after winning at Fenway Park on Saturday night, the Yankees were left with the task of trying to avoid watching the Red Sox, who won a franchise-record 108 games this season, celebrate on their home field for the second time in three weeks. “As awful of a night as it was for us, we’ve got to turn the page,” Boone said. “Tomorrow’s obviously do or die.” The loss set Yankees records for most runs allowed and the largest margin of defeat in a postseason game, and set a Major League Baseball mark for the worst defeat by a home team in a playoff game. It also broke a seven-game postseason winning streak at home for the Yankees. The Red Sox pounded 18 hits, including four by Brock Holt, who became the first player to ever hit for the cycle in a postseason game. His final hit, a two-run homer in the ninth, came off the last of six pitchers, who was not a pitcher at all. [Read Tyler Kepner: Aaron Boone’s Inexperience Leaves the Yankees’ Season in Peril] The Yankees, who will send C. C. Sabathia to the mound on Tuesday night against Rick Porcello, can only hope that their veteran left-hander has more to offer than Severino. “That’s the beauty of baseball – we get to wake up tomorrow and it’s a brand new day and a brand new game,” Aaron Judge said in a mostly empty and somber clubhouse. “So that’s what we’re going to do.” It may be easier said than done — particularly with an atmosphere that is sure to be extra anxious after what unfolded in Game 3. The crowd had urged Severino on — chanting “Sevy, Sevy” when he was in an early jam — but he left to boos, trailing by 3-0 with the bases loaded, none out and the top of the order up in the fourth after he had walked Jackie Bradley Jr., who was trying to bunt, on four pitches. Severino gave way not to one of the Yankees’ relievers used to extricating themselves from those types of jams — David Robertson, Dellin Betances or even Jonathan Holder — but to the starter-turned-reliever Lance Lynn, who had entered in the middle of an inning just once this season. Lynn walked Mookie Betts to score a run, then gave up a bases-clearing double to Andrew Benintendi that left the crowd in stunned silence as it stared at the scoreboard that read: Red Sox 7, Yankees 0. “It was a long inning,” first baseman Luke Voit said. “You’re hoping that someone can make a play and you’re always trying to make that play just to kind of get the morale back. But they can hit and tonight they showed it.” And with Nathan Eovaldi on the mound for Boston, it must have felt like 70-0 to the Yankees. When the Red Sox acquired Eovaldi from Tampa Bay in late July, it was simply to bolster their rotation. But the former Yankee, who missed all of last season after receiving Tommy John surgery with the Yankees in 2016, has proved to be a tailor-made antidote for the Yankees’ upper cut swings and patient approach. Eovaldi has morphed into a strike-thrower who has learned to spot his 100-mile-per-hour fastball at the top of the strike zone and has developed a cut fastball to keep hitters off it. In three starts and one relief appearance for the Red Sox, Eovaldi has allowed one earned run in 23 innings against the Yankees. He went seven innings on Monday, allowing five hits — all singles — while walking one and striking out five. “I’ve had the recent success against those guys, so that helps,” Eovaldi said. “I didn’t have to change up my game plan too much.” In an effort to prod Severino out of a two-month funk, the Yankees reconfigured their rotation after he was shelled at Oakland in early September to give him more rest. In his last three starts of the regular season, Severino was afforded six, six and five days between starts, and he began to pitch better. He had seven days’ rest heading into the wild-card playoff, when he threw four scoreless innings. But he had only four days’ rest entering Monday, and it did not take long to show. Betts ripped the first pitch of the game — a 95-mile-per hour fastball — to deep center field. Brett Gardner tracked the ball down on the warning track, but it was a sign of things to come, as the Red Sox hit one rope after another. “He hasn’t swung at the first pitch in a while, and he crushed that ball,” Red Sox Manager Alex Cora said of Betts. “It didn’t go out, but it kind of let them know, like, ‘Hey, we’re here.’” Severino allowed seven hits, walked two, and of the nine outs he recorded three were balls belted to the warning track in the deepest reaches of the park. “It was a mess,” Severino said of his performance. He added: “Maybe I was trying to do too much.” In the opposite dugout, Cora shook up his lineup to great effect. He benched second baseman Ian Kinsler, third baseman Eduardo Nunez and catcher Sandy Leon for Holt, Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez, hoping to jolt the offense. It could not have worked better. Devers ripped a single to right to lead off the second, stole second base, advanced to third on a groundout and put the Red Sox ahead 1-0 when Vazquez singled off the glove of Severino. Holt began and ended the fourth inning outburst, lining a single to right to start the inning and hitting a two-run triple to right to cap it. Vazquez also singled and scored in the inning. Holt, Devers and Vazquez combined for eight hits, seven runs and eight R.B.I. Now, it will be Boone’s turn to adjust. Neil Walker, who can be counted on for quality at-bats, could find his way into the lineup at third base for Miguel Andujar, which would also give Sabathia — who yields more ground balls than any Yankees pitcher — a more reliable defender. Certain to be back in the lineup will be center fielder Aaron Hicks, who left the series opener with a tight right hamstring, and has not played since, though Boone pronounced him much improved from Saturday. “It was a much harder decision today,” said Boone, who ultimately did not want to risk losing Hicks — who has had a history of muscle pulls — for a lengthy period. But if the Yankees play anything like they did on Monday night, Hicks — and the rest of the Yankees — will have all the winter to get better. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Andrew Benintendi’s hit that cleared the bases on the fourth inning. It was a double, not a triple, and it made the score 7-0, not 8-0.",The New York Times
2018,Red Sox Waste Nathan Eovaldi’s Sterling Relief Effort,"LOS ANGELES — On Friday afternoon, a few hours before the start of Game 3 of the World Series, Nathan Eovaldi appeared at a news conference as the Red Sox’ projected starting pitcher for Game 4. That was the plan, though it was subject to change. It was quickly becoming clear, even then, that everything in the Series was subject to change. In any case, Eovaldi, a 6-foot-2 Texan who throws with a right arm that has twice undergone reconstructive surgery, had already appeared in the first two games of the World Series, throwing two innings of scoreless relief. So before Game 3, he was asked about the physical (and mental) toll of bouncing back and forth between starting and coming out of the bullpen. “I’m sure it could take a toll,” he said, “but right now, I feel really good.” Neither Eovaldi nor anyone else at Dodger Stadium could have anticipated the outsize role he was about to play in Game 3 — an epic mishmash of soap operatic baseball history. “That was the most incredible pitching performance I’ve ever seen,” Rick Porcello, the Red Sox’ starting pitcher, told reporters. “After the game was over, I started crying because that was — I mean, he’s grinding, every pitch. He literally gave everything he had on every single pitch, and it was special.” Eovaldi entered the game in the 12th inning, and kept returning to the mound, inning after inning. He threw 97 pitches, each accompanied by a loud grunt. He did not make his work look easy, because it was not easy, and that somehow made it more commendable. He might as well have been driving a forklift and laying brick. By now, most everyone knows that it ended badly for Eovaldi — unfairly even. In the bottom of the 18th, the Dodgers’ Max Muncy blasted a cutter for a game-ending home run that lifted the Dodgers to a 3-2 win, trimmed their series deficit to two games to one and renewed their championship hopes ahead of Game 4 on Saturday night. But it was a remarkable performance by Eovaldi, one that will surely be revisited in the days and weeks to come. Revisited, perhaps, because the Red Sox could not capitalize on the six-plus sterling innings that Eovaldi gave them: three hits, one earned run, five strikeouts, one walk. Revisited, too, because Eovaldi is up for free agency, and it is impossible to ignore his pockmarked history with injuries. He is laboring for the Red Sox, consuming innings without much rest, and even in the immediate wake of Game 3, he was not willing to acknowledge that he needed a break. “See how I feel,” he said of the possibility of returning sooner rather than later in the series. The Red Sox acquired Eovaldi in a midseason trade with the Tampa Bay Rays. In 12 regular-season appearances for Boston, including 11 starts, he was 3-3 with a 3.33 earned run average. His versatility and stamina, though, have been invaluable in the postseason. He has made two starts and four relief appearances, scattering 15 hits over 22⅓ innings while posting a 1.61 E.R.A. “He’s putting everything together,” Red Sox Manager Alex Cora said after Game 3. “The pitch mix — good breaking balls, good cutters, good fastballs. You almost have to be perfect in that situation, and he was perfect.” Or very nearly. Cora had set out hoping to preserve Eovaldi for Game 4. But as late afternoon dragged into early evening and beyond, Cora was cycling through pitchers and running out of options. Eovaldi was the ninth pitcher whom Cora called on, and Cora said he kept checking on him between innings. Cora recalled their brief conversations. “I’m good,” Eovaldi kept telling him. “I’m good.” Sure enough, Eovaldi was hitting 99 miles per hour with his fastball in the 17th inning. He struck out the Dodgers’ Justin Turner on three pitches to send the game to the 18th. But he soon ran into trouble against Muncy, throwing him a 90-m.p.h. cutter on a full count. Muncy had narrowly missed hitting a home run in the 15th inning, sending a blast that hooked foul by a few feet. But Muncy mashed this one into the bleachers in left-center. The fairy tale was over for Eovaldi, who took the loss — one of the finest losses in postseason history. “I told him how proud I was of him,” Cora said. “The effort was amazing.” At the same time, the Red Sox might regret letting that effort go to waste. Cora broke the emergency glass by summoning Eovaldi to the mound in the first place, and then by leaving him in there to throw pitch after pitch. Ahead of Game 4, Cora’s starting rotation was a bit shredded — and he knew that would be the case. But it was a risk worth taking, and Eovaldi rewarded everyone with a performance worth remembering.",The New York Times
2018,Red-Hot Economy? Women Aren’t Convinced,"A remarkable gender gap has opened up in Americans’ views of their own finances and the broader national economy. Men feel better about the economy than they have in over a decade. Women are far more skeptical. And the sharp divide has emerged since President Trump was elected two years ago. Nearly half of men — 47 percent — said their family’s finances had improved in the past year, according to a survey conducted for The New York Times in early October by the online research platform SurveyMonkey. Just 30 percent of women said the same, despite an unemployment rate that is near a five-decade low and economic growth that is on track for its best year since before the recession. Asked how they expected the American economy to fare over the next five years, nearly two-thirds of men said they anticipated “continuous good times economically.” Women were more likely to expect “periods of widespread unemployment or depression.” The gaps remain even between men and women who are similar in age, race, education and income. It isn’t clear how men’s and women’s diverging views of the economy will affect next month’s elections. There has historically been at most a loose connection between the state of the economy and midterm election results, and Mr. Trump’s signature economic policies poll poorly with swing voters. What is clear is that the gender divide — transcending party lines and voting preferences — is a striking departure from the past. Polls by the Pew Research Center going back to the mid-2000s showed almost no gender gap on economic questions until Mr. Trump took office; since then, men have become significantly more confident, while women’s confidence has stalled. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey has long shown a small gender gap, but the divide grew after Mr. Trump’s 2016 victory and in December reached its widest point on record. The gap has since narrowed slightly but remains larger than before the election. Men’s and women’s views of the economy have diverged since President Trump’s election.

Both are financially stable but have struggled to build up savings or buy a home. But while their circumstances are similar, their views of the economy differ sharply. Mr. Weeldreyer, a Wisconsin native who lives in Denver, said the local job market was strong. To the extent that his finances aren’t where he would like them to be, he blames his own choices earlier in adulthood, not the economy more generally. He is confident in the future. “It’s frustrating not being able to buy a house and stuff, but I guess I don’t lose sleep over it,” he said. “I guess it’ll work out.” Ms. Pierce sees things differently. She says there are plenty of jobs where she lives in central New York State, but pay has lagged. She dreams of the day she can pay her bills the day they arrive, rather than stalling until payday. “It’s gotten a lot harder to do the things that our parents may have done, buy the house and do all the American dream stuff,” she said. “Everything in my life seems to be getting more expensive, and my wages are the same.” Ms. Pierce’s and Mr. Weeldreyer’s different perspectives may reflect at least in part different realities. Denver is in the midst of an economic boom. Rome, where Ms. Pierce lives, has seen a significant rebound in recent years but is still struggling compared with the country over all. Their political views may also play a role. A registered Republican, Mr. Weeldreyer said he voted for Mr. Trump only reluctantly in 2016 and hadn’t made up his mind about how to vote in next month’s midterms. But he said the economy was “probably the one area where I would say the president is doing a good job.” Ms. Pierce is a member of the progressive Working Families Party and said she strongly opposed Mr. Trump’s agenda. Indeed, partisanship explains part of the gender gap. Americans’ assessment of the economy has become increasingly closely tied to their political views in recent years. People who identify as Republicans and as supporters of Mr. Trump are far more likely to say the economy is performing well — and there are significantly more men than women in both groups. Still, partisanship isn’t the whole story. Among men who said they “strongly approve” of Mr. Trump’s overall performance, 76 percent said their finances were better now than a year ago, according to the SurveyMonkey survey. That sentiment was expressed by just 65 percent of women who gave Mr. Trump strong overall marks. Other economic questions reveal a similar gap. “Republican men are just more confident and more optimistic than even Republican women are,” said Laura Wronski, a research scientist for SurveyMonkey. Mr. Trump has repeatedly promoted his economic record, and Republican strategists are hoping the strong economy will help hold off a potential “blue wave” of Democratic victories next month. Still, the economy seems to be doing little to win over groups of women who could be crucial to Republicans’ chances. Ms. Wronski noted that college-educated suburban white women actually felt slightly worse about their finances than women over all — and far worse than similarly situated men. Perhaps not coincidentally, they also overwhelmingly said they planned to vote for Democrats in the midterms. The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate. Diana Shue-Willis is exactly the kind of voter Republicans need to win over to keep control of the House. A college-educated Navy veteran in Virginia Beach, Ms. Shue-Willis is a registered Republican. Her husband works in manufacturing — a core source of support for Mr. Trump, and an industry that has experienced a rebound since he took office. But Ms. Shue-Willis, 49, is pessimistic about the economy. She lost her house to foreclosure during the last recession and now worries that banks are repeating the mistakes that led to the financial crisis. She worries about the cost of health insurance, and about the jobs available for her daughter, who didn’t earn a high school diploma. She said that the construction industry, where she works, was slowing down, and that she didn’t believe the rosy economic figures she heard on the news. “I think the unemployment rate they talk about on TV is misleading,” she said. Ms. Shue-Willis said she wasn’t sure whom she would vote for next month. She isn’t impressed by her Republican congressman, Scott Taylor — or by almost anyone else in Congress, a group she called “a bunch of squabbling hypocrites.” It isn’t clear what, beyond partisanship, is driving the gender divide on the economy. Men have not notably outperformed women in their economic fortunes since Mr. Trump took office. Women have, if anything, received a slightly disproportionate share of jobs, and the pay gap for full-time workers narrowed slightly last year. But hiring has been especially strong in male-dominated sectors such as manufacturing, construction and mining, noted Jed Kolko, chief economist for the job-search site Indeed. That growth, Mr. Kolko said, may be making men more optimistic — particularly because those same sectors had been in a long slump. “We are in this unexpected and perhaps temporary moment where job growth is faster on average in traditionally male-dominated jobs,” he said. Mr. Trump’s policies, Mr. Kolko said, probably have little to do with the blue-collar rebound. But that may not matter. Amber Wichowsky, a political-science professor at Marquette University, said that during the Obama administration, white men — particularly those without a college degree — reported feeling that their social status was eroding. Now that might be reversing. “Their guy’s in office, the economy’s doing well, it’s an even bigger shot in the arm,” Ms. Wichowsky said. “The psychology’s really important.” Even with the unemployment rate under 4 percent, however, millions of Americans are stuck in part-time or low-paying jobs, and many families have barely begun to recover from the Great Recession. “You have an economy that, although the stock market and unemployment rate look good, people’s actual lived experience of making ends meet” is less good, said Corrine McConnaughy, a political scientist at George Washington University. Ms. McConnaughy said the uneven nature of the recovery might affect men’s and women’s views of the economy differently. She said research had found that men, on average, gauged the economy based on their own financial situation. Women tend to weigh more heavily the experiences of the people they see around them. For Addie Chase, the economy is working fine. The shopping center that she and her husband own in Stratford, Conn., is fully rented, and she has a strong stable of students for her business as a piano teacher. But Ms. Chase, 67, said Connecticut as a whole was struggling economically. She sees people leaving the state in search of better opportunities, and she worries about the future. And she said her frustrations with the national political environment were hard to separate from her feelings about the economy. “I just feel like I’m angry all the time, which isn’t my personality,” she said. “Because women are so upset about how things are going, it colors their whole outlook.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Reducing Fatal Crashes,"letter The limo accident that took 20 lives in upstate New York raises two issues that a reader says should be addressed. To the Editor: Re “20 Dead Upstate as Limo Crashes on Way to Party” (front page, Oct. 8): While the causes of the crash are under investigation, this tragic incident in New York underscores at least two longstanding issues in our highway safety system. First, the annual crash fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in rural areas is about 2.5 times the rate in urban areas. The excess risk facing rural residents is attributed to several factors, including high prevalence of speeding and drunk and drugged driving, and inadequate access to emergency medical services and trauma care. A majority of the fatal crashes in rural areas involve a single vehicle running off the road. Installing roadside barriers and clearing roadside objects in “hot spots” could substantially reduce the fatality risk from these crashes. Second, the rate of seatbelt use by back-seat passengers and passengers of taxis and limousines is less than 50 percent — far lower than the 90 percent by drivers and front-seat passengers — largely because it is not required by law. Research indicates that use of seatbelts can reduce the fatality risk by about two-thirds.

2018,"Reeling From Tragedy, Many in Pittsburgh Say Trump Should Not Visit","PITTSBURGH — Still reeling from the horror and grief after Saturday’s massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue, Pittsburgh is now dealing with something else: the barbed politics of the 2018 midterms and widespread opposition to President Trump’s plan to visit here Tuesday. Jewish leaders said that President Trump was not welcome in Pittsburgh and accused him of stirring up extremism. Mayor William Peduto, who strongly rejected Mr. Trump’s suggestion that armed guards in houses of worship are the answer to violence, warned that the president would be a distraction from funerals taking place Tuesday. Many in the Jewish community in Pittsburgh cited what they saw as the president’s divisive rhetoric, which they feel had a role in enabling the violence here, as well as other recent episodes including the mail bombs sent from Florida to prominent Democratic figures and what appears to be the racial killing of two black shoppers near Louisville, Ky. Interviews in Florida reflected a similar urgency and unease about the intersection of violence in American life and the looming midterm elections. The incidents returned to a boil a long-running issue dating at least to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, when Mr. Trump was widely condemned for equating neo-Nazis with demonstrators protesting them. Now, one week before Americans head to the polls, criticisms that the president is sowing hurtful divisions in society have become an electoral issue, a turn of events that the White House and Republicans are vehemently pushing back on. Chants of “Vote! Vote! Vote!” broke out during vigils for victims of the synagogue shootings. Not all Jewish leaders said Mr. Trump was unwelcome. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was in the sanctuary leading a service for the Tree of Life congregation during the shootings, told CNN on Monday: “I’m a citizen. He’s my president. He is certainly welcome.” The president’s visit was announced at a briefing Monday. Later Monday, the White House said Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, would arrive at the Pittsburgh airport at 3:45 p.m. Tuesday, but there were no details about their itinerary in the city. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the news media were unfairly blaming Mr. Trump for inspiring violent acts by lone individuals. She echoed Mr. Trump himself, who on Sunday night angrily took aim at the media one day after denouncing the Pittsburgh attack as a “wicked act of pure evil and anti-Semitic.” “The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans, Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country,” the president wrote on Twitter on Sunday. The issue was most painful and raw in Pittsburgh in the wake of the massacre in which the suspect has a record of virulent anti-Semitism. “I do not want President Trump to come to Pittsburgh,” said Donna Coufal, the president-elect of Dor Hadash, one of three congregations worshiping in the same building on Saturday morning when 11 people were slaughtered. “I feel very sad saying that because I think if he was capable of feeling empathy or understanding how much we welcome strangers into our community, he would be welcome here.” Steve Gelernter, a Republican who lives in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, the backbone of the city’s Jewish population and where Tree of Life is a mainstay, said he was furious that Mr. Trump had not distanced himself enough from views espoused by white nationalists. “He is giving a platform for the closet racists to come out and have a voice,” Mr. Gelernter said. “You never saw any leader speak this way and the country become so polarized.” He said he intended to support Democrats on the ballot this year. His 86-year-old mother, Francine Gelernter, a Holocaust survivor who has lived in Pittsburgh for decades, said that for the first time she did not feel safe in America. She told a grandson, Max, to tuck the Chai necklace he wears under his shirt. Mayor Peduto, a Democrat, said a presidential visit would be a distraction while congregations are burying their dead. “We do not have enough public safety officials to provide enough protection at the funerals and to be able at the same time draw attention to a potential presidential visit,” he said. In Miami on Monday, Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor and Democratic nominee for governor, suggested that Mr. Trump — and Mr. Gillum’s Republican opponent, former Representative Ron DeSantis — bore responsibility if not for the violence then for the tone they set in public. “Our civic discourse is under attack. That kind of irresponsible language is now leading to loss of life,” Mr. Gillum told reporters after a rally. “You can’t give harbor to it. You can’t decry it in a public statement after a tragedy has occurred and then go back to a public rally and then stoke that same kind of, I think, irresponsible language.” Mr. DeSantis has been accused of courting racist elements in Florida and playing dog-whistle politics — implications he denies. One Florida voter, Milo Marcos, 30, said he didn’t vote in 2016 but felt compelled to cast a straight-Republican ballot this year. “I don’t want Democrats to get the House or the Senate,” he said. But he worried that the pipe bombs and Pittsburgh shooting would blunt Republicans’ momentum going into Election Day. “The press was good for the Republicans up to that point,” he said. “The caravan, I think that helped Republicans. You’re putting a face on illegal immigration.” Now, he said: “It just kind of changes the subject and allows the media to bring back the narrative that people who are supporting Trump want to do terrorism. Which is not true. Every side has crazy people.” In Pennsylvania, the Republican candidate for governor, Scott Wagner, who styles himself a Trumplike figure, recently recorded a video boasting that he would “stomp all over” the face of Gov. Tom Wolf with golf spikes. That threat was cited by a voter from Hummelstown, Pa., Jessica Kolaric, 46, who blamed Mr. Trump for a political climate where violence is no longer taboo. “For him to say he’s not inciting the violence within his party and this country, that’s absurd,” she said. Democratic and Republican strategists suggested most voters’ attitudes were already hardened, including opinions about Mr. Trump’s sowing of division. Some said the latest violent episodes would probably not move many votes. “There’s plenty of divisive rhetoric on the left: You can go to Eric Holder or Maxine Waters or whoever you like and find abhorrent comments,” said Charlie Gerow, a Republican strategist in Pennsylvania. “I think most voters have made up their mind one way or the other on both the president’s rhetoric and the rhetoric on the left.” Still, the scenes out of Pittsburgh during the president’s visit might paint a picture with the potential to surprise partisans on both sides. Mr. Trump has mostly avoided visiting states and cities where he is deeply unpopular. Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Josh Friedman, a leader of a progressive Jewish group, Bend the Arc-Pittsburgh, which circulated the letter over the weekend telling Mr. Trump to stay away, predicted the president would find a hostile reception. “He’s going to find streets filled with people that don’t want him here,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Registering to Vote at School,"letter An advocacy group says the idea has great promise. To the Editor: “Time to Close the Democracy Gap” (editorial, “Tune In Turn Out” series, Oct. 19) says that all the innovations that address voter engagement are intuitive and easy to carry out. Voter registration and preregistration through high schools has enormous promise. Even in states that don’t have formal preregistration laws, young people can generally register to vote if they will turn 18 by the next election. This means that the vast majority of high school students can register or preregister before they graduate. The best models in high schools involve peer-to-peer engagement combined with robust civics education and nonpartisan outreach to the entire school community about the deadlines and mechanics of voter registration and voting. Yet most high schools have no plan, no budget and no training to make sure that every graduate is a voter. Effective implementation depends on high school communities, including students, parents, teachers, administrators and school boards, all getting involved. Laura W.

2018,Regulator Seeks Information About Goldman Sachs Ethics Complaint,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an inquiry into the departure of a senior investment banker and Goldman Sachs partner who raised concerns about what he viewed as unethical conduct at the bank, according to people briefed on the inquiry. The partner, James C. Katzman, called Goldman’s whistle-blower hotline in 2014 to complain about a number of practices inside the Wall Street investment bank, people close to Mr. Katzman told The New York Times last month. David M. Solomon, who is now Goldman’s chief executive, urged Mr. Katzman to move past his complaints, and he left the firm in 2015. Among the grievances that Mr. Katzman voiced to Goldman officials were that his colleagues had sought to obtain confidential client information and that the bank inappropriately tried to hire a customer’s child. After he left Goldman, he told people close to him that he felt he could not share his concerns with regulators without violating the terms of a confidentiality agreement with Goldman. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Michael DuVally, declined to comment on the S.E.C. inquiry. “The legal department conducted an exhaustive investigation of the matters Mr. Katzman raised in accordance with our whistle-blower policy,” he said. He added that the job candidate Mr. Katzman was concerned about was never hired. The S.E.C. requested information from the bank about Mr. Katzman’s departure following the Times article, according to the people briefed on the inquiry. The agency also has contacted Mr. Katzman, one person said. The precise focus of the S.E.C.’s inquiry isn’t clear. Mr. Katzman did not respond to requests for comment. An S.E.C. spokeswoman declined to comment. Andrew Vollmer, who previously served as deputy general counsel at the S.E.C. and now teaches securities law at the University of Virginia School of Law, said the agency would most likely be concerned by Mr. Katzman’s belief that his agreement with Goldman barred him from talking to regulators. “The S.E.C. sues companies that have what it claims to be over-broad confidentiality terms that prohibit an employee from disclosing misconduct to the S.E.C.,” Mr. Vollmer said. Any current or former Goldman employees with restricted stock must regularly sign a confidentiality agreement or forfeit the payments. Payments can be clawed back for “cause,” including if the former employee engages “in any act or making any statement which impairs, impugns, denigrates, disparages or negatively reflects upon the name, reputation or business interests” of Goldman, according to the bank’s regulatory filings. Mr. Katzman took that language to mean that he was prohibited from discussing his concerns with the bank’s board or with regulators. Such agreements are common, but three years ago the S.E.C. began taking action against language it viewed as restricting employees from alerting regulators to perceived misconduct. In one case, the S.E.C. sued the engineering company KBR, formerly a subsidiary of Halliburton, because the company required employees who reported misconduct to KBR’s internal investigations group to sign an agreement promising not to discuss the matter with anyone without special authorization from KBR’s legal department. KBR settled the case by paying a $130,000 penalty and adding language to its contract that specifically authorized employees to talk to government investigators without getting permission from its legal department. Goldman’s compensation agreements contain no such exemption for talking to government officials. “We have never limited the ability of our current or former employees to raise any concern that they may have with regulators or the Goldman Sachs board,” Mr. DuVally said. The S.E.C. also might be looking at the substance of Mr. Katzman’s complaints, including his accusation that investment bankers asked him for confidential information about a client he was representing. Mr. Katzman viewed the request as a violation of internal rules meant to prevent the improper use of client materials. “The potential breach of client confidentiality is a huge touch-button issue for the regulators these days,” said Ross Intelisano, a lawyer who represents corporate whistle-blowers. An earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of James Katzman, the former Goldman Sachs partner. He is James C. Katzman, not James M. Katzman.",The New York Times
2018,Relatives of Tails,"daily crossword column Ben Gross and James Somers throw something for everyone into their debut puzzle. SATURDAY PUZZLE — How often do we get a pairs debut? I couldn’t find this statistic. It’s nice to take on a new venture with a trusty companion, like knowing that you have someone to talk to at a holiday party (not that this sort of thing is on my mind these days). I thought this grid was a riot. The “clues from today,” let’s call them, were a little outrageous, but they were tempered by some elegance, nostalgia and wine. Oh, actually, beer and wine, if we’re talking about trusty companions. The “fat” corners in the northwest and southeast were harder than their opposites, but as a whole, it was a really fun solve. There are three vernacular entries today — two of them debuts — that are bound to get a reaction from many solvers. The presumptive seed entry, smack down the middle at 7D, is what I would call louche, because I love that word and because it works for this 21st-century version of a cheap date: NETFLIX AND CHILL. This is the modern version of “Inspiration Point” in the old sitcom “Happy Days,” if you remember that — the laugh track was set to go “ooohhhh” every time anyone mentioned it. For some of us, NETFLIX AND CHILL just means doubly economizing by streaming a movie you only sort of wanted to see, while sitting on a sofa with some dogs and knitting, with the thermostat set to a frugal number because you still have wood-framed windows. It doesn’t have to be louche. The other two, which crossed each other in cunning fashion and were very disarmingly clued, were 26D, BUTT DIALED, and 46A, FLIP PHONES. This is adorbs because it was really hard to accidentally call someone by sitting down with a good ol’ flip phone in your back pocket, and it happens so often with my iPhone now that I have to meticulously prune my contacts lest I unintentionally stalk somebody. One of my more estimable colleagues actually wrote a guide on how to avoid this problem. 25A: This clue was also half of a clever cross, with 18D. A “section” of Cesarean speech is I CAME, I saw, I conquered; at 18D, the Latin word for “that,” a pronoun, is ILLE. Both entries are oft-used in The Times puzzle, but I don’t remember seeing ILLE, so I looked it up. It’s usually clued as “Winnie __ Pu,” in reference to a charming event, the 1960 publication of A.A. Milne’s classic little bear book translated into Latin. The translation went to The Times best-seller list, the only book in Latin ever to do so, and remained there for 20 weeks, and the translator got on “To Tell the Truth.” 28A: Also crossing BUTT DIALED, this clue — “Relatives of tails” — might bring to mind something else caboose-like, derriere-esque, rump-ish. Except the constructors mean elegant formal wear, so please forget what I just said and think swellegant — TUXEDOS, maybe. 8D: I suppose that with a third endearing intersection of entries we’re looking at a pattern. Mr. Gross and Mr. Somers probably engaged in a number of TETE A TETES over this puzzle, one of which was probably sharing delight over the placement of RATATAT at 30A. 32D: The Victorians had Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; we have Miley Cyrus and her ALTER EGO, Hannah Montana. This was a television show, in which Ms. Cyrus played herself, sort of (or at least a teenager named Miley), and lived a double life as Hannah Montana, global superstar. Double lives are rough on people. 34D: After the “Powerful ray” at 5A turned out to be a denizen of the sea, a MANTA, you might have been misled by the “harmful rays” here: they’re ultraviolet! I’ll have my PARASOL refurbished in time for spring. We decided to build the puzzle when Ben realized that the phrase “Netflix and chill” was 15 letters. It felt a little risqué, so we were delighted when the puzzle was ultimately accepted. Our initial construction effort, however, got off to a bad start: Ben had misconfigured our construction software such that it only offered single-word fill — no phrases! We eventually figured out how to use computers properly, and when we were able to pair BUTT DIALED with FLIP PHONES, we knew we were onto something. We struggled a bit with the north-center — we’re not particularly proud of the AREEL/AREI intersection — but we hammered away until we had something we were happy with. Cluing the puzzle was especially fun. We each took a copy of the completed grid and, working alone, wrote up a full set clues. Then we compared clues for each entry in a series of TETE A TETES. Our cluing was helped by a simple shell script James wrote, called cross, which let us see all the past Times clues for any entry we were considering (basically a worse version of xwordinfo.com/Finder).

2018,Relentless and Resilient Red Sox Cap a Record-Breaking Season,"On Baseball LOS ANGELES — Steve Pearce joined the party in progress. The Boston Red Sox added him in a trade in June, a month before the nonwaiver trading deadline, just in time to face a Yankees left-hander in the Bronx. Pearce doubled in his first at-bat. He had always been curious about life as a member of the Red Sox. He was born and raised in Lakeland, Fla., but he rooted for the Boston sports teams because his family had roots in New England. “I was brainwashed as a kid,” he said. On Sunday at Dodger Stadium, in Game 5 of the World Series, Pearce helped his adopted fan base add another jewel to its crown. He started and ended the scoring with home runs, leading the Red Sox to a 5-1 victory and their fourth championship in 15 seasons. [Read an inning-by-inning recap of Game 5 of the 2018 World Series.] “This has been a lifelong journey, and to be here right now is a dream come true,” said Pearce, who hit .333 with three homers and drove in eight runs to win most valuable player in the series. “Best feeling in my life.” He connected for a two-run shot off Clayton Kershaw in the first inning Sunday, and homered again off Pedro Baez with the bases empty in the eighth. David Price, Joe Kelly and Chris Sale throttled the Dodgers, with Sale striking out Manny Machado on a slider to end it. The players mobbed Sale in front of the mound, and Pearce, the first baseman, flung his glove to the sky. In finishing the World Series here, the Red Sox shook off any effects of the most memorable game of this series: the record 18-inning marathon in Game 3. They even had the perspective to recognize history as it happened, even in defeat. When the Dodgers beat them early Saturday morning on homer by Max Muncy — in the 440th minute of the game — the Red Sox were not discouraged. They were excited. “We talked about how crazy of a game it was, and how fun — that was nuts,” the slugger J. D. Martinez said a day later. “I mean, that was an 18-inning World Series game. You never see that; it was the longest game ever! That was pretty sick. Yeah, we lost, but if you’re a baseball fan and you love the game, that’s something you want.” Just as the 1975 Cincinnati Reds recovered from Carlton Fisk’s famous Game 6 homer to win Game 7 in Boston, the 2018 Red Sox shook off Muncy’s blast and won the next night. Their 9-6 comeback win in Game 4 was another validation of their franchise-best 108 victories in the regular season. “You don’t win 108 games in that division, that league, in this day and age unless you’re a pretty good club,” Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said. Martinez was mostly quiet through the first four games of the World Series. So was Mookie Betts, Boston’s other top candidate for the American League Most Valuable Player Award. Both were hitting below .215, just as the Dodgers had hoped. “When you’re game-planning against a particular team, there’s the superstars that you don’t want to let beat you,” Roberts said. “We put Mookie on, we put J. D. on.” The Dodgers used intentional walks to avoid Betts and Martinez in the ninth inning of Game 4. But they could not stop the Red Sox from scoring five runs in the inning, turning a tie game into another emphatic display of a deep and merciless lineup. And Betts and Martinez homered off Kershaw in Sunday’s clincher. The Red Sox took command of this World Series despite getting only four ordinary innings in Game 1 from their ace, Sale, who made more of an impact with a profane dugout rant in Game 4 than he did while pitching in the opener. Yet Manager Alex Cora has helped the Red Sox with a World Series full of inspired moves. Two pinch-hitters — Eduardo Nunez in Game 1 and Mitch Moreland in Game 4 — have delivered three-run homers. Another, Rafael Devers, singled home the go-ahead run in Game 4 after Pearce, a role player who hit .333 in the Series, had tied it with a homer. Pearce was one of three pivotal midseason trade acquisitions by Dave Dombrowski, the president of baseball operations. He also added starter Nathan Eovaldi, who has dazzled in relief in this World Series, and second baseman Ian Kinsler. “One of my favorite things I’ve seen since I’ve been here is the team chemistry on and off the field,” said Pearce, who has played for all five teams in the A.L. East. “And when I came in, they were having fun and laughing, everyone was together and talking baseball. And then you notice on the field when you’re playing against them for so long, they’re always having fun. It’s very contagious, and it’s just a great atmosphere.” Cora has helped cultivate that environment in his first season as manager. He is the third Red Sox manager in the last four to win a World Series in his Boston debut. Terry Francona did it in 2004 (adding another title in 2007), and John Farrell did it in 2013, after the team’s awkward one-year interlude with Bobby Valentine. While Roberts was burned by his reliance on the veteran reliever Ryan Madson, who allowed all seven of his inherited runners to score in Games 1, 2 and 4, Cora has mostly made shrewd bullpen moves. When he left in starter Eduardo Rodriguez to serve up a three-run homer to Yasiel Puig on Saturday night, Cora acknowledged his mistake. “I pushed him too hard,” Cora said, adding later, “I was actually kicking myself for a few innings before the comeback.” Cora played for the Red Sox championship team in 2007, when he was a reserve infielder. That was the only Boston team in a stretch of 17 seasons from 1996 to 2012 that won the A.L. East. Those Red Sox dominated with a pitching staff that had the best earned run average in the A.L. and an offense that led the majors in walks. The lineup revolved around David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez but had firepower throughout. “It’s the same way here — we’ve got Mookie and J. D., but the at-bats around them, they’re great,” Cora said. “It’s a relentless group. We’re not as patient as that group, but we grind at-bats and we foul pitches. Obviously we drive the ball out of the ballpark, but we can do other stuff, too.” Both teams had speed, Cora said, and a strong rotation, stingy bullpen and power hitters off the bench. “And both managers, they’re bald,” he added. Cora had reason to smile. He won a World Series ring at Dodger Stadium last fall as the bench coach for the Houston Astros. Now he has done it again, with a resilient roster that seems to cherish its place in history.",The New York Times
2018,Religion and Right-Wing Politics: How Evangelicals Reshaped Elections,"Retro Report In the early 1970s, many evangelical Christians weren’t active in politics. Within a few years they had reshaped American politics for a generation. When he campaigned for president in 1976, Jimmy Carter often invoked the late theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and his admonition that “the sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.” That sort of faith-inflected speech from a major national politician was new to most voters. So was the candidate himself, a former Georgia governor who taught Sunday school and described himself as born again, an obscure term for many millions of Americans. Mr. Carter managed, narrowly, to win that first post-Watergate national election. As president, he put liberal aspects of his Baptist tradition front and center, whether appealing for racial equality, lamenting economic disparity or making human rights concerns integral to American foreign policy. What he did not win were the hearts and minds of his white co-religionists. A new movement of white evangelicalism awakened during his presidency, one that was socially conservative and hostile to his agenda and to him personally. In 1980, Mr. Carter lost the White House to the Republican Ronald Reagan, who had support from two-thirds of white evangelical voters. They liked Mr. Reagan’s staunch anti-Communism and his calls for limited government, so much so that they closed their eyes to aspects of his character — twice-married, alienated from his children, almost never attended church — that flew counter to much of what they considered elements of an upright life. Coincidentally or not, one year earlier a powerful conservative force had come into being: Moral Majority, founded by the televangelist Jerry Falwell and hostile to abortion rights and homosexuality. This installment of Retro Report, a series of video documentaries about major news stories of the past that have a lasting impact, examines the rise and the legacy of Mr. Falwell, who before his death in 2007 yoked his movement to rightist politicians and helped shape their stance on major matters. American evangelicals had long steered clear of politics, but with the advent of Moral Majority that was no longer so. “For really the first time in any significant way, evangelicalism becomes interlocked with the Republican Party,” Randall Balmer, a professor of religion at Dartmouth College, told Retro Report. In Mr. Reagan they had a president who shared their distaste for modern whirls of social change. His endorsement of them was a clarion call. “It was, like, come up out of the catacombs — you know, you don’t have to be silent anymore,” the conservative columnist Cal Thomas said. They are certainly far from silent in rallying behind the present president, Donald Trump, whose personal traits make him a thoroughly implausible vessel for evangelical aspirations: thrice-married, credibly accused of multiple extramarital affairs, given to vulgar speech. He has talked of grabbing women by the genitals, demeaned immigrants from poor countries and said, in defiance of a central Christian tenet, that he has never seen reason to ask God for forgiveness. Yet white evangelical support for Mr. Trump exceeded 80 percent in the 2016 election; he did better even than George W. Bush, who was outspoken about his rebirth through Jesus. Important evangelical figures like Franklin Graham, Billy Graham’s son, practically swoon. “I believe he’s president of the United States for a reason,” Mr. Graham has said of Mr. Trump. “I think God put him there.” The infatuation appalls some others on the religious right, among them Michael Gerson, a speechwriter for Mr. Bush who was reared in an evangelical family. In an Atlantic magazine article this spring, Mr. Gerson criticized the likes of Mr. Graham and Jerry Falwell Jr. for having provided “religious cover for moral squalor.” A comparably dark assessment was offered by Timothy Keller, a Presbyterian clergyman who wrote in The New Yorker last December, “ ‘Evangelical’ used to denote people who claimed the high moral ground; now, in popular usage, the word is nearly synonymous with ‘hypocrite.’ ” All the same, Mr. Trump’s us-versus-them pugnacity is well-received by white evangelicals. He shares, and augments, their fear that the country they know is slipping away — if not already lost, what with upheavals like legalized same-sex marriage, acceptance of gay and transgender rights, and the ascension of religious and racial minorities. Those evangelicals, Mr. Gerson wrote, have proved susceptible to “a message of resentful, declinist populism.” In other words, to Mr. Trump’s message. Thus far, he has delivered for them in significant ways. His two appointments to the Supreme Court signal a desire to chip away at Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion. Breaking with decades of precedent, he shifted the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a move long sought by both Israeli leaders and American evangelicals. This president seems indifferent at best to social programs long woven into the nation’s cultural fabric but scorned by the religiously orthodox. “Our giveaway programs, our welfarism at home and abroad,” the elder Falwell once sermonized, “is developing a breed of bums and derelicts who wouldn’t work in a pie shop eating the holes out of doughnuts.” One can easily imagine Mr. Trump giving a similar speech. Will white evangelicals continue to influence the national discourse so powerfully? Perhaps. But the demographic tide would seem to work against them. They are getting older, with a median age of 55. Statistics from the Public Religion Research Institute in Washington show that they now account for 15 percent of the population, down from 23 percent a dozen years ago. A younger cohort of evangelical Protestants is increasingly black and Latino. Ethnicity aside, they resemble other young Americans in not automatically sharing their elders’ hostility to same-sex marriage, abortion or gay and transgender rights. They are more likely to believe that nurturing the newborn is at least as important as protecting the unborn, and that their self-description as pro-life includes desiring affordable health care for everyone. In barn-red Texas, some white evangelical women have had it with unquestioned fealty to Republicans. Galvanizing them are Trump administration actions like separating immigrant children from their parents at the southern border, a policy they deem anti-Christian. “I care as much about babies at the border as I do about babies in the womb,” Tess Clarke of Dallas told a New York Times reporter. For voters who feel as she does, it is a matter of establishing justice. And that, Reinhold Niebuhr might have reminded them were he still living, remains politics’ sad duty. Jimmy Carter “taught Bible classes all his adult life, with an emphasis on what is in Scripture rather than what is not — mainly, a regard for the poor, the rejected, the victims of prejudice and injustice,” Garry Wills wrote in a review of “Faith,” a recent book by the former president. A 1971 obituary marked the death of Reinhold Neibuhr, a theologian “who preached in the marketplace, a philosopher of ethics who applied his belief to everyday moral predicaments and a political liberal who subscribed to a hard‐boiled pragmatism.” Jerry Fallwell, who died in 2007, “helped create the religious right as a political force, defined the issues that would energize it for decades and cemented its ties to the Republican Party,” Peter Applebome wrote in his obituary. Earlier this month, Elizabeth Dias spoke to Tess Clarke and other white evangelical women in Texas who are no longer willing to blindly follow their religious leaders. They are endorsing Beto O’Rourke, the Democrat who is challenging Senator Ted Cruz for a Texas Senate seat in next week’s election.",The New York Times
2018,"Religion and Women’s Rights Clash, Violently, at a Shrine in India","NEAR SABARIMALA TEMPLE, India — As a woman and a man climbed a steep trail on Thursday leading to one of Hinduism’s holiest temples, a mob multiplied with frightening speed. From a point farther up the path, several hundred men screamed at the woman, insisting that she immediately turn back from visiting the Sabarimala Temple, a centuries-old shrine in southern India. When the pair of visitors, both journalists for The New York Times, decided to descend, the crowd rushed at them, hurled rocks and pummeled two dozen police officers. “Madam, you don’t be afraid, O.K.?” Habeeb Ullah, one of the police officers, told one of the journalists, a bit too late. For centuries, women of childbearing age were prohibited from entering the temple, which is perched on a lush hill in the coastal state of Kerala. Last month, after India’s Supreme Court struck down that ban, saying that barring women from the temple infringed on their constitutional rights, thousands of protesters pledged that women who dared to visit the temple would be punished. On Wednesday, when the temple opened for the first time since the ban was scrapped, it quickly became the latest battleground in a long-running conflict between India’s modern, liberal court system and deeply conservative elements of its ancient culture. Protesters, many of them women, assaulted several journalists, smashed vehicle windshields and tried to rip a 22-year-old woman who planned to visit the temple from a bus. “Hooliganism reigns in this place,” the woman’s father, Manoj, who goes by one name, told the Indian news media. “It’s almost as if these people view women as terrorists.” By late Wednesday, the Kerala government had deployed hundreds of heavily armed police officers near a river bed at the base of the trek, and dozens of people had been arrested. Manoj Abraham, a police officer in the area, said, “Every devotee will be allowed safe passage.” But the dispute is about something much broader than access to a temple: whether Supreme Court rules can be enforced in a spectacularly diverse country of 1.3 billion people, where progressive court orders issued in New Delhi are abstract, or optional, in rural parts of India, and communities are intensely organized around religion. Though Indian women are leading campaigns to dismantle discriminatory rules on access to religious sites, and courts are ruling in their favor, the grip of tradition is still ironclad in places like the Sabarimala Temple. “In India, the people’s belief is more important than any law,” said Devidas Sethumadhavan, a district officer in Kerala for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu nationalist group. For as long as anybody can remember, caretakers at the Sabarimala Temple, which hosts millions of pilgrims every year, have obediently enforced a de facto ban on women and girls who menstruate, defined by temple officials as those between 10 and 50 years old. The restrictions are rooted in the belief that the presence of menstruating women, who some Hindus believe are impure, would distract Lord Ayyappa, the deity the shrine is dedicated to, because he is celibate. But in September, the Supreme Court overturned a 1991 decision by the Kerala High Court, which had upheld the ban. The Supreme Court ruled 4 to 1 that preventing menstruating women from visiting the shrine violated the country’s Constitution and was similar to the ostracism faced by India’s lowest castes, formerly known as “untouchables.” “This denial denudes them of their right to worship,” Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who has since retired, wrote in his opinion. In a concurring opinion, Judge Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud wrote: “To treat women as children of a lesser god is to blink at the Constitution itself.” Around Kerala, the ruling brought a wave of anger, particularly among far-right Hindu nationalists affiliated with India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which rose to power in 2014 with the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Members of the B.J.P. and other political parties have demanded a review of the court’s order. But Kerala’s chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, who accused fringe Hindu groups of backing Wednesday’s attacks, said the state government would do everything in its power to uphold the Supreme Court’s ruling. “Those who want to pray cannot be stopped,” he said. For the Times journalists, the problems started before the trek had even begun. Early Thursday morning, when they walked toward the starting point, a group of young men asked where they were going, where they were from, and if the woman, 46, had an identification card. Later, with cameras from several local television stations surrounding the journalists, a group of men started chanting “Go back!” and “Leave!” in Malayalam, a local language, and English. Along the trek, framed by views of thick forest and cubbyhole restaurants selling lemon soda and snacks, the intensity of the attacks grew more acute and better organized. After a bare-chested man, muttering under his breath and wearing a saffron scarf, a politically charged symbol for Hinduism, pointed his cellphone camera at the woman, a long line of men began doing the same, and then they followed her. Past the halfway point, a larger crowd higher on the hill started screaming, raising fists in the air and jumping on the trail’s side railings. When the journalists decided to turn back, the protesters, apparently emboldened, started chasing them. Police officers braced for the impact, swatting the air with wooden batons. Several of them insisted that it was still safe for the pair to continue, even as they struggled to hold the crowd back. At one point, a group of men broke through the clasped hands of the officers, who had formed a ring around the woman, and threw rocks at her. She was struck on the shoulder but was not wounded. At the bottom of the hill, heavily armed officers ushered away the two journalists, who were escorted from the area in a caged bus. The police said that no woman had gotten so close to the temple in more than two decades. Officers said they were not sure what would happen in November, when traffic to the temple picks up enormously, and when pilgrims often wait 10 hours just to start the hike. In previous years, women under 50 might have gone unnoticed in the crowds, the police said, but this year, with tensions raised, greater scrutiny is expected. Still, there were a few small signs of encouragement. As the female journalist neared the bottom of the trail, an angry group trailing her, a small man pushed past a police officer, stuck out his hand and smiled. “I want to congratulate you,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Remains of 63 Fetuses and Infants Found at Second Detroit Funeral Home,"The remains of 63 infants or fetuses were found at a funeral home in Detroit on Friday, the Detroit Police Department said. The discovery came amid an expanding investigation, one week after authorities found the decomposed remains of 11 infants or fetuses at another — apparently unrelated — funeral home in Detroit. The discoveries have raised concerns about the handling and disposal of human remains by the city’s funeral homes, especially in cases of stillbirth. On Friday, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs found “heinous conditions and negligent conduct” at the Perry Funeral Home. State authorities said on Saturday that they removed 37 remains from boxes and 26 from a freezer. Some of the human remains there were found to be years old. In an emailed statement, the department said the Perry Funeral Home may have committed criminal violations by failing to properly dispose of bodies or to facilitate their final dispositions, such as burial or cremation, in accordance with state laws. The business was shuttered Friday and its license was suspended. In an emailed statement on Saturday, Joshua I. Arnkoff, a lawyer representing the funeral home, said it had not committed any criminal offenses. The remains were unclaimed by parents, the statement said, and the funeral home did not have the legal authority to conduct a final disposition — such as a burial or cremation — of those remains. The discovery was prompted in part by a lawsuit filed in July by a woman whose daughter, Alayah Laniece Davis, died shortly after she was born in a hospital in December 2014. At the time, the mother said the body should be given to Wayne State University Medical School for research or educational purposes, the lawsuit said. Instead, the remains ended up in the custody of Perry Funeral Home and may have been stored at the Wayne State University School of Mortuary Science for years without the mother’s knowledge, according to the lawsuit, which also named the university and the hospital where the baby was born as defendants. The lawsuit said the funeral home indicated, on a certificate of death, that the infant’s remains had been buried in a cemetery, even though they remained at the mortuary. All of this happened over a period of years without the mother’s knowledge, the lawsuit added. “We’ve got multiple layers of potentially criminal activity by Perry Funeral Home, lack of supervision on the part of the mortuary science program and gross negligence on the part of the hospital,” said Peter J. Parks, a lawyer for the mother. The statement from the funeral home’s lawyer said Perry was not involved with the body donation program. “Perry Funeral Home received these remains from local hospitals who had indicated to Perry that the remains were ‘unclaimed’ by the parents,” it said. “In other words, the hospitals had informed Perry that the hospitals had reached out to the parents by certified mail and/or by phone, and the families did not respond. We do not believe that any of these remains involve families that paid Perry for funeral services.” In a statement emailed on Friday, Wayne State University said it had become aware of the lawsuit only recently. “Without offering an opinion on the lawsuit itself, we believe the claim against the university is baseless and we will be moving soon to dismiss it,” it added. A spokeswoman for the Detroit Medical Center, where Alayah was born, could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday but told The Detroit News that it was against its policy to discuss pending litigation. On Oct. 12, news broke that infants’ remains had been found hidden in the ceiling of another funeral home — the Cantrell Funeral Home, which had been shuttered in April. The news reached Alayah’s family, which encouraged Mr. Parks to share their concerns about Perry Funeral Home with the police, which he did. In a news conference on Friday, Chief James Craig of the Detroit Police Department said the two funeral homes did not appear to be connected, and that officials may form a task force to investigate how human remains are stored and documented in the area. “This is larger than we might know,” he said. Daniel W. Cieslak, another lawyer representing Alayah’s mother, said in an interview on Friday that based on documents he had seen while investigating this case, there could be hundreds of fetuses’ remains in the custody of Perry Funeral Home. “I’m glad they recovered that many,” he said after investigators found dozens of them on Friday. “But it seems to me that there could be more.” Mr. Cieslak and Mr. Parks hope to turn the mother’s complaint into a class-action lawsuit. Chief Craig called the situation “very, very disturbing” and said that state authorities could be called upon to help with a wider investigation. “There’s a lot that has happened in the last 24 hours,” Mr. Cieslak said, adding that he was glad the authorities had investigated the Perry Funeral Home. “But it’s raising more questions for me now.”",The New York Times
2018,Rembrandt’s ‘Night Watch’ to Undergo Years of Restoration,"AMSTERDAM — The Rijksmuseum announced on Tuesday that it will restore Rembrandt’s “Night Watch,” a monumental group portrait that holds pride of place in the Dutch national museum here and the hearts of the Dutch people. The restoration will last several years, while the painting remains on display in the museum’s Gallery of Honor, so that the public can observe the process. Taco Dibbits, director of the museum, said in an interview that this will be a “huge undertaking” and the Rijksmuseum’s “biggest conservation and research project ever.” He compared it in scale to the restoration of the frescoes of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. He did not provide an estimate the cost of the renovation, but said it would be “millions over at least several years.” Rembrandt’s 1642 painting, formally known as “Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq,” has not been restored since 1976, after a museum visitor attacked it with a bread knife, jabbing two-foot-long knife marks into the surface, cutting a seven-foot-wide hole, and ripping off a section of the canvas. At that time, the museum was able to restore the painting and retouch the surface, but some of the retouching has now turned yellow, Mr. Dibbits said, and needs to be redone. The museum conservators have also noticed that the bottom left-hand corner of the painting, where there is a small dog, has become blanched over time, and they don’t know why. The Rijksmuseum plans to first study the painting for about eight months, using new scanning technologies that were not available during previous restorations, such as macro X-ray fluorescence scanning, which can explore different layers of the paint surface to determine what needs to be done. The restoration itself is likely to take at least a couple of years, Mr. Dibbits said. Throughout the whole process, a transparent showcase will be built around the painting, the scientists and the restorers, so that visitors can view the progress. Mr. Dibbits recalled watching the previous restoration of the “Night Watch” when he was a child growing up in Amsterdam. “I was 9 and we went as a family several times to watch it,” he said. “It’s very impressive because you can see the process and you’re basically standing in the operation theater.” When it is completed, Mr. Dibbits hopes that the investigation and restoration will give scholars more insight into the work, and offer visitors a clearer sense of the original painting. “Visually it will be a big change,” Mr. Dibbits said. “You will be able to see much more detail, and there will be areas of the painting that will be much easier to read.” “There are many mysteries of the painting that we might solve,” he added. “We actually don’t know much about how Rembrandt painted it. With the last conservation, the techniques were limited to basically X-ray photos and now we have so many more tools. We will be able to look into the creative mind of one of the most brilliant artists in the world.”",The New York Times
2018,"Remembering the Marvelous, Maddening Mario Buatta","postscript Under all that colorful chintz there were some serious dust bunnies, but also a lot of laughs. When Mario Buatta drew his last breath at 9:12 p.m. on Oct. 15 at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the celebrated interior designer, 82, known for his exuberantly colorful work, riotous persona and matching sobriquet, the Prince of Chintz, seemed at peace. At his side were his family and two stalwart friends: Emily Evans Eerdmans, with whom he wrote “Mario Buatta: Fifty Years of American Decoration” (Rizzoli, 2013), and Anne Eisenhower, the decorator and a granddaughter of America’s 34th president. “He was wearing his favorite color, blue,” Ms. Eerdmans said. Moments before, the two women had played recordings of cabaret music he loved, including a favorite romantic ballad, “Baby I’m a Fool,” sung by Melody Gardot. A generous host, Mr. Buatta loved taking friends to cabaret, theater and comedy shows. When Peggy Lee performed in New York, he would attend every performance, sometimes for 40 days in a row. Other favorites were the comedian Joan Rivers and Marilyn Maye. “He put a lot of fun into everyone’s lives,” said Joan Kron, a writer. A leading proponent of the so-called American English country house style, Mr. Buatta was at one point the country’s most famous decorator. His clientele included Barbara Walters, Nelson Doubleday, Malcolm Forbes, Henry Ford II, Billy Joel and Mariah Carey, and his “Buatta-ful” interiors adorned the covers of Architectural Digest, House & Garden, and House Beautiful. For Ann and Charles Johnson, he designed eight houses, including a grand apartment at the Sherry-Netherland in Manhattan and Carolands, a 98-room Beaux-Arts chateau in Hillsborough, Calif., built by an heiress to the Pullman railway coach fortune. “Mario decorated it beautifully,” Ms. Johnson said. “Many people didn’t know he was also a very good period decorator.” As a close friend of his for 30 years, I can attest that he could be delightful and exasperating in equal measure. He was often hilariously funny, loyal, kindhearted and impulsively generous. On the flip side, his jokey patois and fiery temper tantrums left some wondering whether he was inflamed with rage or just pulling your leg. Or possibly both. “Decorating can be quite psychological and intense,” Ms. Eerdmans said. “Mario had a gift for keeping it light.” She admitted, though, that he could be a “curmudgeon,” if a loyal one. When the decorator was in top form, few could resist his madcap charm. “Mario was wonderfully eccentric,” said Patricia Altschul, a longtime client whose antebellum mansion in Charleston, S.C., designed by Mr. Buatta, is featured on the TV series “Southern Charm.” “I invited him to fancy parties, and he would show up wearing a fake wig and eyeglasses 50 times too big,” Ms. Altschul said. “He looked like a giant grasshopper.” When they attended a black-tie reception at Buckingham Palace Mr. Buatta, an incorrigible prankster (who often faked foreign accents and different identities on phone calls), brought his “companion,” Harold, a motorized rubber cockroach, and sent him scampering over a grand commode. This elicited roars of laughter from Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. “He was a frustrated performer at heart,” Ms. Altschul said. “My son Whitney called him ‘The Dame Edna of decorators.’” “Mario loved to have fun,” Ms. Altschul said, “but he would also get cranky and scream.” Shop assistants and workmen were frequent targets of his blistering fulminations. “He was a holy terror,” Ms. Altschul said. Temo Callahan, a designer and a longtime friend, met Mr. Buatta while working at Clarence House, the fabric showroom. “Mario was a delightful, charming, wonderful person,” Mr. Callahan said. “But he was a paradox. If you had a sense of humor, you got along with Mario. If you were a silly shop person, he would grind you into bits.” “He’d be screaming and winking at the same time,” Mr. Callahan said. “A lot of people didn’t understand that. He was very difficult but lots of fun. Mario loved high drama. You have to remember it was drama, not meanness.” Mario joked about his own paranoia about assistants, fearing that they would steal his ideas and trade secrets. (“Mario accused everyone of stealing,” Ms. Kron said.) Some who worked for him in the 1980s remember him fondly. Others do not. “Mark Hampton had 20 assistants,” Mr. Callahan said, referring to another famous decorator, with whom Mr. Buatta collaborated in the 1980s on a design of Blair House, the president’s guesthouse across from the White House. “Mario had yellow legal pad pages of his to-dos, folded into quadrants,” Mr. Callahan said. Panic ensued every time he thought he’d dropped them. In more recent years, Mr. Buatta was a proud Trump supporter, much to the dismay of his many liberal Democrat friends. Convincing him otherwise was an unrewarding battle, said Louis Bofferding, an antiques dealer and Obama supporter. “The first time Mario got mad at me, he came into my shop and asked the prices,” Mr. Bofferding recalled. He said, ‘How can you ask these prices when you’re a socialist?’” “I had to laugh,” Mr. Bofferding said. More troublingly to some, the design genius who wrought exquisite interiors for his clients preferred to live in exotic disarray. “I am the original hoarder,” he told The New York Times in 2013, referring to his passionate — perhaps borderline pathological — collecting habits. Friends, clients and journalists entreated him for invitations to his grand parlor-floor apartment in the East 80s in Manhattan, but it was strictly off-limits. “I asked for 30 years to see his apartment,” Ms. Altschul said. “He never let me in.” Mario was extraordinarily kind to me when I began writing and performing satirical songs in the late ’80s that cheekily skewered some of the wealthy Park Avenue parvenus who happened to be his clients. I tried to repay his kindness by visiting him in the hospitals and nursing homes where he spent most of his time during the last three years of his life, refusing exercise. I also had the dubious privilege of helping him to tidy up his increasingly untidy apartment. In recent years, it was piled high with grand English furniture interspersed with tarpaulins up to the ceiling, Groucho Marx mustaches, huge gilded palm tree lamps and makeshift towers of books and magazines that threatened to collapse at any minute. The windows of his parlor floor apartment were magnificent in scale but ominously opaque. He explained that it was merely three decades of dust and soot. (The floor-through apartment was crepuscular even on a sunny summer’s day.) He refused to hire a maid, convinced that anyone who entered his lair was bound to steal something of incalculable value. His vast office on the ground floor was also piled to the ceiling with fabric swatches, multiple generations of Harolds, catalogs, coffee table books and thousands of CDs of Lee and other of his favorite cabaret singers. He loathed billing. An avowed Luddite, he stabbed out invoices with one finger on a rickety typewriter using pastel-colored carbon-copy paper. I convinced him to buy a computer in the mid-1990s and soon regretted it when he inundated me with calls asking how to operate it. (Locating the delete key remained a challenge.) Inevitably the infernal “machine” was cast aside and became entombed in dust. When he died, Mario was about three years behind on his billing. He implored me to do it for him and was furious when I politely declined the honor. “He always said, ‘I’ll get around to it,’” Ms. Kron said. An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a cabaret singer whose music was played for Mario Buatta in the moments before he died. She is Melody Gardot, not Melodie Gurdot.",The New York Times
2018,"Remembering the Moon Landing, Nearly 50 Years Later: ‘We Were All Completely Silent’","A new film, “First Man,” tells the story of Neil Armstrong’s stepping onto the moon in the summer of 1969. We asked readers to tell us what they remembered about that historic day. There was no such thing as YouTube in 1969. If you missed watching an important event on TV, you couldn’t Google it to catch up. For the most part, you just had to be there. The Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969, was one of those important events. As Neil Armstrong descended the steps of the lunar module and became the first person to set foot on the moon, the world’s eyes seemed to be upon him. As “First Man,” a new film from Damien Chazelle, tells the story of the landing from Armstrong’s perspective, we asked readers what they remembered of that day and what it meant to them. Here is a selection of their responses, which have been edited and condensed for clarity. Please use the comments to share your own memories. We almost missed it as we headed home from the lake. It was late. We were on a dark empty road paved with gravel that we had driven on for miles without seeing a house, a light or another car. We were listening to a radio station that crackled and faded in and out as signals were found and lost and found again. As it became clear that the astronauts were about to step out of the lunar module, the pressure on my dad mounted to FIND SOMEPLACE WITH A TV NOW. At that point, I think we would have stopped at any house we saw and asked to come in and watch their TV with them. With only minutes to go, we saw the lighted sign of a gas station in the true middle-of-nowhere, Missouri. We pulled off near the pumps and our tires made that “ding ding” sound that cars always triggered at gas stations back then. We went into the station and found an older man sitting in the dark with only the black and white of his tiny television flickering in the dust and the stagnant air that smelled of rubber tires and motor oil. He was sitting in the only chair and so we, my mom and dad and brother and I, sat down on the cold dirty floor. And there, surrounded by the mechanics of autos, we watched a man step down onto the moon. — Russ Ann Oppermann, Olathe, Kan. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] I was 5 years old and staying with my family at our “summer house,” a rustic cottage in rural Upper Greenwood Lake, N.J. We attended a local performance of the musical “The Fantasticks” that afternoon, and I was enraptured. The show suddenly stopped and a television set was brought out to the center of the stage. The actors, still in costume, gathered cross-legged on the stage to watch the moon landing, joined by the audience. I vaguely remember the television images of the moon landing itself. More indelible for me is the memory of how momentous it seemed when the magical stage performance I had been watching came to a halt so that the actors could join us in watching something unique and important. — Thea Lawton, Anchorage I was in summer camp in upstate New York. We had one TV, an old black and white set, in a large room with beat-up couches. More than 100 campers and counselors crowded into the room. We saw Neil Armstrong step from the ladder and heard him say, “That’s one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind.” He left out the “a” before “man.” The sentence made no sense. Some of us were disappointed that our first step onto the lunar surface began with poor English. [As The Times’s 2012 obituary for Armstrong states: “His words would become the subject of a minor historical debate, as to whether he said ‘man’ or an indistinct ‘a man.’] Some also weren’t thrilled to find out that the plaque left on the moon bore the signature of Richard Nixon. — S. Finkelstein, Lewes, Del. I still have the black and white negatives we shot off the TV — a full roll. — Felice Frankel, Boston We were visiting relatives in New Jersey on the day of the landing. We watched the landing on TV there. (I think my father was disappointed that Walter Cronkite wasn’t on the moon to personally show the landing and to interview the astronauts.) We took off for home, where we planned to watch the moonwalk. Originally there were many hours until the moonwalk, so we had plenty of time. However, as we drove up, the radio informed us that NASA was continually moving up the time of the moonwalk, so we became a bit nervous. As we drove through our hometown of Syracuse, N.Y., on the normally busy highway, we realized that we were the only car on the road! Everyone was home watching the spectacle. Fortunately, we arrived home with some time to spare, so we were able to watch the moonwalk. — Lee Schechter, Binghamton, N.Y. I was spending the summer on Monhegan Island, where we had a family home. The island had no electricity, but across the street June Day had a generator. She put her TV in her front yard and a crowd gathered to watch the event. Watching TV on the island was novel, but seeing the first man on the moon was unforgettable. We were all completely silent. — William Vaughan Jr., Chebeague Island, Me. I was 8 years old and watched the moon landing from my parents’ living room in Nashville. It had a profound impact on my life. So much so, I now work for NASA, made friends with Neil, Buzz [Aldrin] and Mike [Collins] and have managed the anniversary commemorations for the agency since the 35th anniversary of the lunar landing. — Bob Jacobs, Washington A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.

2018,Rent Hike Hits Beloved Drama Book Shop,"Books News Over the past century, the Drama Book Shop, a legendary independent bookstore that has one of the largest selections of plays in the country, has survived a series of natural and man-made disasters: a fire that damaged a collection of signed first editions, floods, multiple break-ins and armed robberies (once, the thieves took the entire safe). But can the store withstand another rent hike? On Wednesday, that question alarmed members of the theater community, after news broke that the store’s owners would not renew the lease at its 40th street location next year, facing rising rents that have been suffocating struggling retailers throughout Manhattan. Allen Hubby, a vice president of The Drama Book Shop, said the store couldn’t afford to pay much more than its current rent of nearly $20,000 a month, but plans to move to another location in the neighborhood and to remain in the theater district. “We sell $10 plays,” he said in an interview in his office at the back of the store. “It’s never made anybody wealthy, but we’ve always been able to pay our bills.” The planned move, which was first reported by Crain’s New York, isn’t the first time the beloved store has been displaced. Since its founding around 1917 by the Drama League, a theatrical association, the shop has migrated a few times over the decades before landing in its current location at 250 West 40th Street in 2001. But it has always been strategically situated in the theater district. Over the decades, acting legends and Broadway and film luminaries have visited the store — including Marilyn Monroe, Katharine Hepburn, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Midler, Alan Cumming, John Lithgow, Kevin Kline and Cher. The store has 20 staff members, most of them part time, and stocks more than 20,000 titles, including plays in translation and musical libretti from popular Broadway plays. Acting students often come by in search of monologues for auditions. “There’s no where else in New York where there’s such a large selection of plays,” Mr. Hubby said. It’s also long operated as a creative hub and incubator for new productions. The Story Pirates, a children’s theater group, practices and holds performances upstairs. The basement functions as a cozy theater space. “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda worked on the music for “In the Heights” on the piano in the basement. In 2011, the store even won a Tony Award, for “excellence in theater.” “Name another Tony-winning bookstore,” Mr. Miranda said in an interview. “We have to figure out what we’re going to do,” he said when asked about the store’s unique role for theater lovers and artists and the possibility of its closing. “That’s it.” The Drama Book Shop is the latest independent bookstore in Manhattan to be squeezed out by stratospheric rents. Earlier this month, a brief panic swept through the literary world when the website Bowery Boogie reported that McNally Jackson would be closing its Prince Street store, a space it occupied for 14 years. After an outcry on social media about the erosion of Manhattan’s cultural institutions, the store announced on Twitter that it would relocate in June 2019, but plans to stay in the neighborhood. Before the news of the rent spike, the store appeared to be thriving: earlier this year, it opened a large new outpost in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. While some took comfort in the Drama Book Shop’s hundred year history of surviving periodic rent hikes and other disasters, including rampant crime in Times Square in the 1970s, others worried the store might not land on its feet in a neighborhood where rent increases are driving out even large retail chains. “This is bad news for the theatre community,” the theater producer James Forbes Sheehan wrote on Twitter. The Broadway actor Alex Boniello, who has performed in “Spring Awakening” and “Dear Evan Hansen,” summed up the collective reaction from the theater world with a crying-emoji filled tweet: “No!!! This can’t be!!!”",The New York Times
2018,Republican Candidate in Pennsylvania Threatens to ‘Stomp All Over’ Opponent’s Face,"Standing by the side of the road three weeks before Election Day, Scott Wagner, the Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania, wanted to send a message to the incumbent, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat. It said, in part: “I’m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes.” That violent imagery was perhaps the most jarring of several verbal bombs thrown by Mr. Wagner in a video posted to Facebook on Friday, as the country approaches the homestretch of a tense campaign season. By Friday afternoon the video had been viewed over 28,000 times. “Well, Governor Wolf, let me tell you what, between now and Nov. 6, you better put a catcher’s mask on your face, because I’m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes,” Mr. Wagner roared, as the sound of cars whizzing past could be heard nearby. “Because I’m going to win this for the state of Pennsylvania. And we’re throwing you out of office. Because I’m sick and tired of your negative ads.” The ad came as both parties have sparred over the level of civility in politics, with Republicans recently likening Democratic protesters during the confirmation hearings for Brett M. Kavanaugh to a mob and criticizing remarks about Justice Kavanaugh by various Democrats. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Wolf’s campaign condemned Mr. Wagner’s remarks. “Scott Wagner’s latest rant shows he is unhinged and unfit for office,” Beth Melena, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Threats of violence have no place in society, especially from someone running for public office."" But Andrew Romeo, a spokesman for Mr. Wagner, said in a statement that his “comments were not to be taken literally.” “He wanted them to be a metaphor for how he will approach the final stretch of the campaign,” Mr. Romeo said. The video was meant to argue that Mr. Wolf had been “hiding behind false and negative attack ads like a coward,” he said. The negative ad that appears to have so enraged Mr. Wagner, and which he showed during his Facebook video, claimed that the waste management company he owns, Penn Waste, had sued 6,979 of its customers. Mr. Wagner defended the lawsuits, saying they were a necessary part of getting delinquent clients to pay their bills. “If you have a company and you render a service, you want to get paid for it,” he said. Polls suggest that Mr. Wagner, a former state senator, may have trouble throwing Mr. Wolf out of office. A poll released last month by Franklin & Marshall College showed him trailing the incumbent by 22 points, 30 percent to 52 percent, among likely voters, with 17 percent of voters undecided. Fifty percent of respondents said Mr. Wolf was doing an “excellent” or “good” job as governor. Regaining ground in Pennsylvania is a key priority this year for the Democratic Party, which reeled when the state voted for President Trump in 2016. Along with Michigan and Wisconsin, it was one of three states considered reliably blue whose votes for Mr. Trump helped decide the election. The political terrain suggests Democrats have reason for hope in November. Republican candidates face an electorate, especially in suburban swing districts, that remains uneasy with Mr. Trump. And earlier this year, the state Supreme Court ordered a redesign of Pennsylvania’s congressional districts, which were deemed a partisan gerrymander that favored Republicans. An earlier version of this article misstated Scott Wagner’s current political position. He is no longer a state senator, having resigned in June to run for governor.",The New York Times
2018,Republican Candidates Soften Tone on Health Care as Their Leaders Dig In,"WASHINGTON — In advertisements, in debates and on the campaign trail, Republican candidates are abandoning their promise to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act and are swearing that they never voted to undo protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions — and never will. But as the candidates seek to assuage voters who say health care is their top issue, their leaders are staying the course, setting up a collision between campaign promises and the party’s agenda should Republicans emerge from the midterms in control of Congress. Representative Steve Scalise, the House majority whip and possible speaker, vowed to revisit the legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act that passed the House last year but died in the Senate. “As long as we can keep making it better we will,” he said in an interview, “but ultimately we need to fix this broken system.” That is not the message voters are hearing. Some of the campaign claims have been audacious — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, in a debate this week with his Democratic rival, Representative Beto O’Rourke, said he had never taken aim at pre-existing conditions, even though the “Cruz amendment,” offered during the Senate debate to repeal the Affordable Care Act, expressly permitted insurance companies to offer plans with none of the protections of President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, including those for pre-existing conditions. In the House, dozens of lawmakers who voted repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act have introduced or signed onto resolutions affirming the importance of coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, even though such protections would have been weakened or removed by their votes. Some, like Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, have released ads explaining their support for the issue, and others have scrubbed critical mentions of the Affordable Care Act from their websites entirely. “They’re just trying right now to hold the House, and then they’re going to reassess where they are on the issue,” said Tim Chapman, the executive director of Heritage Action, a conservative lobbying group. If the language on the campaign trail is to be believed, that reassessment could be dramatic. Representative John J. Faso, Republican of New York, voted last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act on a razor-thin, party-line vote. Now in the political fight of his life, Mr. Faso said he hoped Congress would take a more bipartisan approach. “The thing I think would be most important would be to actually get buy-in from a certain number of Democrats,” he said, adding, “If we try to go down a one-party approach, I think that’s doomed to failure.” Republicans are betting that voters will distinguish their attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act from the issue of pre-existing conditions. They maintain that their replacement bill, the American Health Care Act, would ensure that people with pre-existing conditions could receive insurance, although the bill would have let states seek waivers that would weaken those protections. It would have also eliminated rules blocking insurance companies from charging patients with pre-existing conditions more. But political winds have shifted. A Fox News poll released this week found that 54 percent of those polled had a favorable opinion of the Affordable Care Act, tying a record high. Health care remains voters’ top issue in the midterms, according to polling released Thursday by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. When those who call it very important are asked to describe what health care issue concerns them, nearly one in five names a need to increase access, and far fewer mention opposition to the Affordable Care Act, the poll found. Those findings track with a previous study that found widespread support for the health law’s provision preventing insurance companies from denying coverage based on a person’s medical history. “This seems to be a real breakthrough for people; whatever else they understand about how health insurance works, it bothers them to think that insurers might charge you more or exclude coverage for your condition because it’s pre-existing,” said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the foundation. “It registers in such a profound way with the public, they want that to continue to be the law of the land.” But Republican leaders have not wavered. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told Bloomberg News this week, “It’s no secret that we preferred to start over” to repeal and replace the health law. Democrats have seized on Mr. McConnell’s remarks as proof that Republican candidates’ tempered remarks are nothing but campaign artifice. ""Republican candidates know they are on the losing side of this issue, so they’re just covering their tracks,” said Leslie Dach, the chairman of Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group. “They’re putting these statements on TV, and I think McConnell’s statement pulls the rug out from everything they’ve been saying.” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, accused Mr. McConnell of “blurting out the truth.” “If the G.O.P. controls Congress next year, they will return to their monstrous campaign to steal health insurance from tens of millions of families, raise health costs, impose an age tax on older Americans and destroy protections for the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions,” she said. Republicans, in turn, have accused Democrats of misrepresenting their position on health care, dismissing their attacks as fear tactics. “They’re trying to bait and switch you, so Republicans appear to be on the defensive,” said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas. “They are going to use this desperate lie of an attack against us when in fact what we’re trying to do is cater” to constituents. But on the campaign trail, the advertisements appear to have at least tempered how candidates previously supportive of repealing the legislation are willing to discuss the issue. Mr. Faso counts himself among more than a dozen Republicans who signed onto a resolution “expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a replacement for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act should have certain features” introduced by Mr. Sessions, affirming the importance of ensuring protections for those with pre-existing conditions. “I felt strongly I needed to reiterate my position on it. I just think the principles that are outlined are ones that could help guide us going forward,” Mr. Faso said. Whether that approach carries into the next legislative session remains to be seen. But Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who studies American public opinion, noted the power of the public as a balance to governing authority. “What candidates are hearing on the local level now is that people are really concerned that perhaps some of the protections in Obamacare will be taken away,” Ms. Bowman said. If re-elected, will Republicans weigh those concerns when they consider further action? “I think they will have to,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,"Republicans Abandon Vulnerable Lawmakers, Striving to Keep House","DALLAS — Vice President Mike Pence laid out a hopeful vision for the midterm elections this week as he campaigned for Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, telling Republican donors that candidates like Mr. Sessions could stop Democrats from winning the House in November. “The road, they know, to their majority comes right through Pete’s district,” Mr. Pence said. Referring to this city’s vote-rich suburbs of undecided moderates, he added, “Make sure the red wave starts here.” Mr. Pence was deploying a favorite image of both Republicans and Democrats this fall: An electoral tidal wave of voters carrying their party to power in Congress. But the point of his trip was not to stir a wave. It was to build a wall. As they brace for losses in the House of Representatives, Republican Party leaders are racing to reinforce their candidates in about two-dozen districts, trying to create a barricade around their imperiled majority. They are pouring money and effort mainly into moderate suburban areas, like Mr. Sessions’s seat, that they see as critical to holding the chamber by even a one-seat margin. And they have begun to pull millions of dollars away from Republican candidates who have fallen substantially behind in once-competitive races. Republicans steering the House effort, who insisted on anonymity to discuss party strategy, believe that by intensifying their efforts in a smaller number of districts, they can limit Democratic gains to perhaps 20 seats on Nov. 6 — just short of the 23 seats Democrats need to take over the House. Party leaders are counting on a surge of energy from conservative voters to repel Democrats in many of the redder districts on the House map, so that they can concentrate their advertising on teetering purple seats. Republicans in Congress and the White House see a Democratic takeover in the House as a mortal threat, potentially allowing the opposition party to bring the Republican agenda to a halt and launch far-reaching investigations that could put the Trump administration under siege. There are between 60 and 70 Republican-held districts that are being seriously contested, and Democrats, boosted by strong fund-raising, have been expanding their television advertising in conservative-leaning districts in an effort to stretch Republicans thin. National polls have shown most voters favor a Democratic-led House over a Republican one, though the Democrats’ lead has varied. In a tactical retreat, Republican groups have already withdrawn some or all funding from a few embattled incumbents, mainly in suburbs where President Trump is unpopular, including Representatives Kevin Yoder of Kansas, Mike Coffman of Colorado and Mike Bishop of Michigan. They have abandoned more than half a dozen seats where Republican lawmakers are not running for re-election. On Wednesday they cut loose the Tucson, Ariz.-based seat of Representative Martha McSally, who left to run for Senate. Party strategists said several other incumbents must recover quickly or risk losing funding, including Representatives Peter Roskam of Illinois and Mimi Walters of California, who represent white-collar suburbs near Chicago and Los Angeles, respectively. Former Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the G.O.P. might be helped by the renewed energy of its base following the battle over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, but he added that independent voters remained a challenge. “You want to hold your losses to 20 or 22,” Mr. Davis said, underscoring Republicans’ vanishingly thin margin for error. “This is the kind of year where Republicans are going to have to give up on some races and they’re going to have to make some hard choices.” Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the Republican committee, said the party is continually “evaluating the best way to use our resources and the best paths forward” to defending the House. “Our number-one goal, above all, is keeping the majority,” Mr. Gorman said. In a memo circulated to Republican donors this week, Corry Bliss, who helms the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC funded heavily by Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, laid out the party’s precarious position. Mr. Bliss said the Supreme Court fight had boosted Republican enthusiasm and a few vulnerable incumbents were looking stronger in polling, including Representatives Will Hurd of Texas and Andy Barr of Kentucky. The Adelsons, who donated $30 million to the super PAC last spring, have given millions more from their casino fortune to Mr. Bliss’s group in recent weeks. But Mr. Bliss said Republicans were facing a “green wave” of Democratic money, as Democratic challengers raise enormous sums online and donors like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, pour millions into anti-Republican ads. “There are 20 races within four points that will determine the House majority, and C.L.F. will keep working to win them,” Mr. Bliss wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. Democrats believe Republicans will not be able to shrink the House battlefield: Democratic groups have taken an aggressive approach to the map, probing Republican vulnerability even in districts that tilt to the right. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently began advertising in six conservative-leaning seats, from rural Pennsylvania to the suburbs of Little Rock, Ark., where they see Republicans slipping. On Thursday, the group began spending money against two more targets: Representatives Brian Mast of Florida, whose red-hued district stretches north from Palm Beach, and Mia Love of Utah, in the Salt Lake City suburbs. Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, who chairs the Democratic committee, said the landscape of competitive races was already too broad for Republicans to build an electoral firewall around a chosen few. “Many of these districts are closing our way,” Mr. Luján said, adding: “There are many paths for us to get to a majority.” Mr. Luján wryly pointed to Mr. Sessions, 63, as an example of Republican distress, noting that the Republican candidate had suggested last year he would not need help from the national party. Now, Mr. Luján said, Mr. Sessions is “calling the cavalry home to see if they can defend that seat” against Colin Allred, his Democratic challenger. The Dallas race reflects the territory where Republicans plan to stand and fight. It is a diverse district, about half white, and a highly educated one, with more than two-fifths of residents holding college degrees. Though it has long tilted toward Republicans, voters favored Hillary Clinton over President Trump in 2016, and Mr. Trump remains unpopular according to polling conducted by both parties. The streets are dotted with “Beto for Senate” signs, and Republicans expect Senator Ted Cruz’s Democratic challenger, Beto O’Rourke, to carry the area. But this is by no means a left-leaning district: many moderates here tend to be registered Republicans, and Democrats have struggled in the past to mobilize its sizable Latino, black and Asian-American communities in congressional elections. Mr. Sessions, a House committee chairman, is in a close race with Mr. Allred, 35, a civil rights lawyer whom Republicans have sought to brand as a liberal. A poll conducted by The Times and Siena College found the two effectively tied, and both parties are saturating the district with advertising. House Majority PAC, the main Democratic outside group focused on the House, began a $2.3 million ad campaign against Mr. Sessions this week, attacking his two-decade tenure in Congress and his vote last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Dallas Mayor Michael S. Rawlings, a Democrat who holds a nonpartisan office, said Mr. Sessions was at risk of losing because voters wanted to rebuke Washington, and Mr. Trump most of all. Mr. Rawlings, a moderate who has avoided endorsing in House races, said he was backing Mr. Allred in part because Mr. Sessions had failed to be a “moral leader” and challenge offensive Trump administration policies, like its ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. “This race represents a major part of Dallas that is very centrist, which I identify with and I’m an example of — business individuals, families that have careers in commerce,” Mr. Rawlings said. He faulted Mr. Sessions for his close alignment with the president, saying “I think the environment around him changed, and he made his choices the way he decided to make them.” Republicans are determined to contain their losses in areas precisely like the one Mr. Rawlings described, where most voters have supported Republicans in the past. Private Republican polling has shown conservative voters growing more enthusiastic over the last few weeks, but Democrats are still more energized, and moderate voters are currently leaning their way. Republicans say they are prepared to make ruthless choices in these districts. In the suburbs ringing Philadelphia, for example, they may soon redirect money out of an open-seat race where they are trailing, in Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District, and funnel it to Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, who are in difficult races. In races where they believe they can rescue embattled incumbents, Republicans must still overcome suspicion among moderate white voters, especially women. In Pennsylvania, for instance, Patricia Hankins, a retired computer programmer, said she had supported Mr. Fitzpatrick in the past but this year planned to vote for his Democratic challenger, Scott Wallace, a wealthy investor. Ms. Hankins, 56, said she still liked Mr. Fitzpatrick but was frustrated by the lack of federal action on gun control and wanted Democrats to take the majority. “The Republican Party has gone so far to the right that you can’t even really have reasonable conversations,” Ms. Hankins said. After Mr. Pence’s event in Dallas on Monday, Maryann Collins, a local Republican precinct leader, expressed optimism that more conservative voters were finally getting energized to block Democrats from gaining control. Ms. Collins, who said she is “86 and proud of it,” said the Supreme Court fight had “fired a lot of people up.” “They’re more determined than ever that they’re not going to let the nuts take over,” Ms. Collins said.",The New York Times
2018,Republicans Are Suddenly Running Ads on Pre-existing Conditions. But How Accurate Are They?,"It’s a sign of the issue’s importance that several candidates in close races are feeling pressure to respond. For months, Democratic candidates have been running hard on health care, while Republicans have said little about it. In a sign of the issue’s potency, Republicans are now playing defense, releasing a wave of ads promising they will preserve protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. The ads omit the fact that the protections were a central feature of the Affordable Care Act and that the Republican Party has worked unceasingly to repeal the law, through legislation and lawsuits. Republicans in Congress have recently come forward with limited legislative proposals to ensure some pre-existing conditions protections if the health law is overturned. One, a House resolution, would have no force of law, even if adopted. The other would contain a significant loophole: Insurers would have to cover those with pre-existing illnesses, but would not have to cover care for those particular illnesses. (Neither is on track to become law.) As with some Democratic advertisements, several ads by Republicans feature family members with health problems. Some directly respond to criticisms offered by a Democratic rival. Many cite votes for Republican bills that would have overhauled large portions of Obamacare last year — the very same votes that Democrats have been using as evidence that Republicans want to limit health coverage. Protection of pre-existing conditions is popular, and surveys suggest that voters trust Democrats more than Republicans on health care. A few months ago, Republican candidates were happy to focus their messages elsewhere — on the economy, or immigration policy. They are now defending themselves on less friendly territory. Here are a few of this new crop of G.O.P. ads and some context. The Republican candidate: Josh Hawley, Missouri’s attorney general, is challenging the incumbent, Senator Claire McCaskill. The ad: A tight shot of Mr. Hawley talking into the camera is cross-cut with images from a field where his family and children are playing with brightly colored soccer balls. Mr. Hawley describes how one of his “two perfect little boys” has a rare disease that would be considered a pre-existing condition. “We know what that’s like,” he says, before saying that he supports “forcing insurance companies” to cover pre-existing illnesses. The boy kicks a ball across the field. The strategy: Mr. Hawley is among a group of G.O.P. officials from 20 states who have brought a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. If the suit succeeds, the entire law, including its guarantees of affordable coverage for Americans with prior illnesses, could be eradicated. (The Trump administration has argued in court that most of the law should stand, but its pre-existing conditions protections, alone, should be invalidated.) Ms. McCaskill has been using Mr. Hawley’s participation in the suit as a central line of attack in her campaign, and has highlighted her personal experience with breast cancer. Mr. Hawley says he supports protections for those with pre-existing conditions, but it’s not clear whether the policies he supports would provide the same protections that people like his son currently enjoy. If his lawsuit invalidated the entire health care law, it would return the country to a time when people with prior illness sometimes couldn’t buy coverage at all. Republicans could pass a law restoring Obamacare’s consumer protections, but Mr. Hawley has not yet explicitly endorsed such a strategy. In an interview this summer, Mr. Hawley said he supported unspecified policies to protect such customers and to allow young adults to remain on their parents’ health plans. “We can do those things apart from the structure of Obamacare,” he said, recommending a less stringent set of regulations on insurance benefits. Last year’s Republican repeal bills provided some protections for people who remained insured without interruptions in coverage. But they would have permitted insurance companies in some states to avoid covering certain types of medical treatments or to charge higher prices to sicker customers who had let their coverage lapse. The Republican candidate: Dana Rohrabacher is an incumbent congressman from California’s 48th District who has served in the House since 1989. He is being challenged by a lawyer and real estate businessman, Harley Rouda, in a very close race. The ad: Mr. Rohrabacher stands beside his wife, while his daughter, Annika, sits on a swing. Mr. Rohrabacher explains why health care is “personal” for his family: “When my daughter Annika was 8 years old, she was afflicted with leukemia. It was devastating for my family, but she got through of it.” Photos of Annika in a hospital bed and a wheelchair are replaced with video footage of the Rohrabacher family walking along a beach (Mr. Rohrabacher wears a wet suit and carries a surfboard). “That’s why I’m taking on both parties and fighting for those with pre-existing conditions,” he says, shaking a fist. After Mr. Rohrabacher says he endorses the ad, Annika adds: “And so do I.” The strategy: Mr. Rohrabacher really does have a novel strategy to try to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, one that is at odds with the dominant approaches of both political parties. His proposal, explained in an op-ed this summer, would allow commercial plans to avoid covering pre-existing illnesses, but allow affected patients to get Medicare coverage for those ailments alone. The ad casts Mr. Rohrabacher as a creative and nonpartisan lawmaker, with a personal interest in health care, rather than one who follows Republican leaders. But when it came to more realistic choices for managing the health care system, Mr. Rohrabacher also voted for the American Health Care Act last year, a bill that would have upended large parts of Obamacare. The bill would have made large cuts to the Medicaid program, which covers many American children, and weakened protections for patients with prior illnesses in states that pursued waivers of Obamacare’s usual rules. His unusual proposal appears to tie his support for that bill with his commitment to Americans like his daughter. But his commitment is an imperfect match with his legislative record. The Republican candidate: Dean Heller, a Republican Senator from Nevada, is in a close race for re-election against Jacky Rosen, a congresswoman from the state’s Third District. The ad: To understand this advertisement, you almost need to have seen Ms. Rosen’s attack ad against Mr. Heller, which compares him to an inflatable tube man, spineless and floppy, as it describes his shifting positions on last year’s Obamacare repeal effort. Mr. Heller’s ad shows the tube man waving on a screen beside a television camera and a director’s chair labeled ROSEN. “Jacky Rosen’s idea of fixing health care: a campaign commercial,” Mr. Heller says, as the camera zooms out. Mr. Heller criticizes Ms. Rosen for failing to advance health care legislation, saying: “I’m fighting to protect pre-existing conditions and increase funding for Nevadans who need it most. Jacky, I’ll stack my record up against yours any day.” The commercial closes with another shot of the tube man. The strategy: Mr. Heller found himself in a tough spot when Republican repeal bills came to the Senate floor last year. Republican leadership really needed his vote to advance a bill, and he had promised as a candidate to repeal Obamacare. But Nevada’s governor opposed the legislation, saying it would hurt the state. First, Mr. Heller opposed the Senate bill. Ultimately, he voted for a more stripped-down plan that would have kept pre-existing condition protections while eliminating other key parts of Obamacare. (He also noted his support for a bill that would have replaced Obamacare’s insurance markets with a block grant program to states that would have allowed them to eliminate pre-existing conditions protections altogether.) It is true that Mr. Heller has advanced more pieces of health legislation in the last Congress than his opponent. He was, after all, part of the Republican majority that controlled the legislative agenda. But neither of the health care bills Mr. Heller cites in his ad has become law, and it’s questionable whether their effects would match his claims in the ad. These are the same bills and votes that Ms. Rosen has cited as evidence that Mr. Heller would pare back health coverage. The reference to Ms. Rosen’s ad suggests it has been memorable enough to voters to merit a response. The Republican candidate: Kevin Cramer, North Dakota’s congressman, is running to unseat a Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp. The ad: There are cows. “Come on, Heidi, the word’s out,” the ad’s narrator says, citing news reports fact-checking aspects of Ms. Heitkamp’s ads that criticized Mr. Cramer’s health care record. “It’s a stampede,” the voice says, as cows trot across the screen, pursued by a cowboy with a lasso. (Side note: Is this a stampede?) The narrator explains that “Kevin Cramer voted for guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions.” Ms. Heitkamp’s health care advertisements, the narrator says, “don’t pass the smell test.” Then a cow moos. The strategy: Like Mr. Heller, Mr. Cramer is trying to characterize his votes to repeal Obamacare as efforts to preserve protections for pre-existing conditions — and he is responding to Democratic ads highlighting the issue. That claim is a bigger stretch for Mr. Cramer than it is for Mr. Heller, despite some quibbles with details of Ms. Heitkamp’s ads. Mr. Cramer voted to support the American Health Care Act, a bill that would have allowed states to weaken protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. If the bill had become law, North Dakota might have preserved Obamacare’s rules, but that is different from “guaranteed coverage.” Mr. Cramer also recently co-sponsored a nonbinding House resolution that argues that pre-existing condition protection should be in future health overhaul bills. That suggests Mr. Cramer is engaged on the issue, but that also is different from a guarantee.",The New York Times
2018,Republicans Find a Facebook Workaround: Their Own Apps,"Imagine a society in which everyone more or less agrees with you. You wake up in the morning to online greetings from people who share your views on guns, religion and country. Your news feed contains only posts from like-minded politicians or articles from like-minded news outlets. You can safely post your own comments without fear of vitriol from trolls or challenges from naysayers. This is the insular world in which tens of thousands of Americans who use conservative political apps are experiencing the midterm election season. Amid a chorus of conservative complaints that Facebook and YouTube have become hostile to right-leaning views — and as those social media giants take steps to limit what they see as abusive or misleading viral content — a few Republican consultants have begun building a parallel digital universe where their political clients set the rules. One start-up has built an app for the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association that has been downloaded more than 150,000 times. Supporters of President Trump can download an app from Great America, a big-spending pro-Trump political action committee, or America First, Mr. Trump’s official 2016 campaign app, which has some features that remain active. Many backers of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas use Cruz Crew, an app built for his re-election campaign. The apps deliver curated partisan news feeds on what are effectively private social media platforms, free from the strictures and content guidelines imposed by Silicon Valley giants. Some allow supporters to comment on posts or contribute their own, with less risk that their posts will be flagged as offensive or abusive. Many apps have video-game-like features where users can earn points for making campaign donations or contacting their legislators. Amass enough points and a supporter can attain increasing status levels — like “BigLeague” or “Patriot” — or even gain a spot on the app’s leader board. Crucially, these mini-platforms harness the powerful reach of platforms like Facebook and Twitter even while competing with them. Some apps give users the option of posting on Twitter or Facebook messages that are scripted by the campaigns, combining the seeming authenticity of organic social media posts with the message discipline of paid advertising. Proponents are positioning these apps as durable communities that offer conservatives viable alternatives to mainstream social networks. The Great American app has offered text messages that you can send to your representatives with a push of a button. The app identifies your representatives from the ZIP code you provide when building your profile. “People with center-right views feel like the big social platforms, Facebook and Twitter, are not sympathetic to their views,” said Thomas Peters, the chief executive of uCampaign, a start-up in Washington that developed the N.R.A., Great America and Trump campaign apps. “It’s creating a safe space for people who share a viewpoint, who feel like the open social networks are not fun places for them.” Sheltered from the broader public, however, the platforms can intensify political polarization and social divisiveness, or circulate disinformation. Anyone in the United States may download uCampaign apps, Mr. Peters said, but they give a campaign the ability to bar interlopers who post messages challenging the campaign’s positions. The Great America app juxtaposes a mix of enthusiastic posts about Mr. Trump and photos of puppies with anti-immigrant memes like “Today’s illegals, tomorrow’s Democrats.” One recent post, with an image depicting nooses, read: “Noose flash: Treason still punishable by death.” The Great America app also hosts a ritual called “Fake News Friday,” in which it awards “Trump points” to users who post liberal-bashing, mainstream-media-trashing memes. “Is this the beginning of the political Balkanization of digital engagement technologies?” asked Michael Slaby, a communications strategist who oversaw technology for President Barack Obama’s national campaigns. “Given the tribalism of current American politics, it’s possible.” Dan Backer, general counsel for the Great America PAC, said the app was a place for like-minded Trump supporters to socialize and entertain themselves. It has also enabled the campaign to quickly and inexpensively engage supporters. Since 2017, the Great America PAC has paid uCampaign about $108,000 for development and monthly service fees. Mr. Backer added that the app’s user policy prohibits abusive comments and those that incite criminal activity. But, he said, “I don’t think we want to be in the business of trying to censor people’s political views.” Democratic candidates have also used consumer-facing apps to promote their political campaigns and advocacy. But the main election apps currently used on the left — such as MiniVAN, built by NGP VAN, a leading technology provider to Democrats — are geared more narrowly for campaign volunteers engaging in door-to-door canvassing, an activity where they can woo and record details on individual voters. Many are not designed to create lasting social communities. This year, Democratic campaigns are also embracing peer-to-peer text messaging, a technology that may engage younger voters more than stand-alone candidate apps do. Not to be outdone, uCampaign recently started its own peer-to-peer texting platform, RumbleUp, for conservative campaigns. Mr. Peters, a Catholic blogger and former web developer, said he hadn’t set out to become the go-to app maker for conservatives. In 2012, he was working as a conservative activist in Washington and grew frustrated with the success of the Obama campaign’s digital outreach efforts. The Obama campaign had a smartphone app that supporters could use to follow campaign news, volunteer, canvas voters and promote campaign messages on social media. Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger, had an app whose central feature was a photo filter allowing supporters to take selfies with the slogan “I’m with Mitt.” Mr. Peters was not impressed. “It did not do the one thing I wanted it to do,” he said, which was to “help win the election for Mitt Romney by asking me to donate money to them, to post things to social media, to invite my friends and family to register to vote — to do all of the things, basically, that the Obama app did.” In 2014, Mr. Peters started uCampaign with $150,000 in start-up capital. The money came from Sean Fieler, the president of the hedge fund Equinox Partners and a well-known donor to conservative groups. Since then, uCampaign has developed dozens of campaign apps, including for Republicans like Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, the Republican National Committee and organizations like the Family Research Council, a Christian group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. Campaigns pay the company a one-time fee to develop an app and then monthly service fees. And the start-up is spreading its tools globally — to conservative political parties, anti-abortion groups, and other causes in Europe and countries including Canada and Australia. In the United States, apps developed by uCampaign have been downloaded more than 500,000 times. A Republican polling company, WPA Intelligence, is behind Senator Cruz’s campaign app. The N.R.A. and Great America apps, which enable users to friend and message one another, have developed cultures with their own parlance and rituals. In their posts, users sometimes greet one another as “deplorables” or “fellow patriots” and refer to liberals as enemies, “libtards” or traitors. Conspiracy theories — including memes against the financier George Soros — abound. The midterm elections are not about Democrats vs. Republicans but, as one N.R.A. app poster put it, “socialism vs. freedom.” Outsiders, for their part, can keep out. Soon after a reporter for The New York Times contacted 10 users via the apps, a person with the user name Deplorable Dee posted on the Great America news feed: “Troll Alert!!! New York Times asking for interviews, do not communicate with these libtards.” Only one user, Ken Kumerle, a car rental agent in South Carolina who has earned more than 366,000 points on the N.R.A. app, agreed to be interviewed for this article. “They all seem very patriotic to me,” Mr. Kumerle said of the members of the N.R.A. app community. “I go in every day and try to do something, post or send a tweet.” The apps are being deployed as larger tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, are under scrutiny over how they share and secure their users’ data. Facebook, which is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for allowing third-party apps to obtain personal information about users’ friends, has taken steps to restrict what user data can be pulled off the platform. By tracking their users’ activities, political apps can collect a wealth of data about them and their social circles outside Facebook’s control. Apps from uCampaign and WPA Intelligence, for instance, ask users for their name, address, phone number and email address. The apps from uCampaign may also collect user names and other details when users post campaign messages from the apps on Twitter or connect their Facebook accounts. The National Rifle Association app offers users 100 points for posting a comment on its news feed and 200 points for telling their legislators, “No New Gun Control Today!” Both uCampaign and WPA have ties to AggregateIQ, a political technology company based in Canada. AggregateIQ is under investigation by the British government over its handling of voters’ personal data and connections to the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, a voter profiling company that improperly harvested the information of millions of Facebook users. In 2016, AggregateIQ paid uCampaign to create the campaign app for Vote Leave, the secessionist side of the British referendum on leaving the European Union. More recently, WPA hired the Canadian company to develop the underlying software used in the Cruz app. The Times tested several of the apps’ privacy practices and found that, when a user invited a friend to join uCampaign’s N.R.A. app, the app did not send the friend’s information to itself or to other companies. But The Times found that a similar feature on WPA’s Cruz app sent a friend’s contact details to an AggregateIQ domain. Chris Wilson, the chief executive of WPA Intelligence, said his company, not AggregateIQ, received and controlled app users’ information. Some political apps, including from uCampaign, also ask users who want to send friends campaign messages to share their contacts. If a user agrees, the app can try to match the contacts to profiles of likely voters, using information provided by a political campaign. As an example, Mr. Peters, the chief executive, described how the Trump app in 2016 was able to match 68 of his 900 contacts to voters in swing states. “It asked me to send a text to my mom in Michigan saying, ‘Only Trump has a plan to repeal Obamacare,’” Mr. Peters said. “But it asked me to send an email to a friend in Florida saying that ‘only Trump has a plan to build the wall.’” Mr. Peters turned some of those features, like inviting friends, into a way for users to collect points and gain status within the group. He began incorporating gamelike features into his company’s apps in 2014 as a way to get supporters to participate in political activities. In July, for instance, the N.R.A. app began offering users 100 points for tweeting a slogan urging their senators to support Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court. The messages have since been have tweeted more than 13,300 times. The Cruz app similarly awards points to users for tweeting campaign messages, volunteering and taking part in other activities. “The Obama campaign proved, and Democrats continue to prove, the value of continuously engaging supporters via an app like this,” said Mr. Wilson of WPA Intelligence, the company behind the Cruz app. “It is critical Republicans keep up with tools of our own.”",The New York Times
2018,Republicans Hold Cash Edge Heading Into Final Stretch of the Midterms,"WASHINGTON — Republicans entered the final month of the campaign with more money in the bank than the Democrats, providing them with vital ammunition as they wage a furious effort to hold on to control of Congress. The most recent round of campaign finance disclosures, filed Saturday, showed that Republican national party committees, candidates in key House and Senate races and their top unlimited-money outside groups, or “super PACs,” had $337 million on hand as of Sept. 30. Their Democratic counterparts had $285 million in the bank on the same date. It was a rare bright spot for Republicans in a fund-raising picture otherwise dominated by Democrats on the strength of their breakneck small-donor fund-raising by candidates in key congressional races. By contrast, Republicans owe their cash-on-hand advantage to brisk major-donor fund-raising, and a slower pace of spending, by their party committees and super PACs. The three national Republican Party committees had outraised their Democratic counterparts $531 million to $471 million since the beginning of 2017, according to the disclosures with the Federal Election Commission. Super PAC fund-raising was basically a draw, with the top 10 Democratic super PACs outraising their Republican counterparts $335.3 million to $335.1 million — washing away concern among Democrats that they could be swamped by a late tidal wave of cash from wealthy Republicans. Overall, Democrats have outraised Republicans $1.29 billion to $1.23 billion, counting their respective top super PACs, national party committees and campaigns in targeted congressional races, according to an analysis of election commission filings covering the beginning of 2017 through the end of last month. The analysis does not capture all of the money at play in the final weeks, including spending by nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors, as well as seven- and even eight-figure donations that major donors or their advisers say have been — or are expected to be — given to super PACs after the period reflected in Saturday’s filings. It also does not necessarily mean that the committees with the largest nest eggs — such as the Republican National Committee, which has $51.3 million in the bank, compared to the Democratic National Committee’s $10.3 million — will necessarily spend their cash in the midterms directly. But the analysis provides a broad assessment of the relative financial strength of the two parties in what is expected to become the first midterm election to surpass $5 billion in total spending. And it hints at how the two sides might allocate their resources as Democrats try to capitalize on their energized base to claw control of the House away from Republicans and make inroads on the state level and, less likely, in the Senate. The Republican cash advantage could allow the party to bolster financially strapped campaigns that still have a chance, and fund an emerging strategy of nationalizing the race around President Trump and culturally divisive issues like immigration and the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Republicans are issuing ominous warnings about liberal “mobs” deploying dirty tactics to help Democrats smear conservatives and push the country toward socialism. “We’re seeing parity in the money race, and I expect both sides to be taking a pretty hard look at their races in the next week or two, so that they can cut some, and double or triple up on others,” said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that analyzes campaign fund-raising and spending. The bigger strategic issue for candidates, party committees and super PACs, he suggested, will be how they adjust to Mr. Trump’s efforts to nationalize the midterm elections in a manner that defies recent political norms. “President Trump in the last two weeks has managed to dominate free media coverage in a way that is firing up his base, and the value of that cannot be measured in the same way you measure super PAC advertising or party committee spending,” he said. On the Democratic side, a pair of top super PACs — Priorities USA Action and the League of Conservation Voters’ PAC, known as the LCV Victory Fund — last week launched a joint $300,000 digital get-out-the-vote advertising campaign. The ad, which is intended to mobilize young voters and voters of color in four competitive House districts, seemed to suggest that a vote for Republicans is a vote for white nationalism. The two super PACs have combined to raise tens of millions of dollars this year, according to election commission filings, with big checks coming from labor unions and wealthy liberals, including a total of $2.5 million from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor. Mr. Bloomberg, who is considering a 2020 presidential campaign, is planning to spend $100 million to help Democrats capture control of Congress, a political adviser said, including $20 million he donated this month to Senate Majority PAC, the leading super PAC supporting Democratic Senate candidates. His political adviser, Howard Wolfson, said: “Big money has traditionally sided with Republicans. But in this cycle you’ve seen some change with at least a couple of Democratic donors who are attempting to level the playing field a little bit, and we would certainly be prominent in that group.” On the Republican side, the biggest super PAC of the cycle, the Congressional Leadership Fund, began airing radio ads last week deploring “the liberal mob, pushing their extreme views, trying to hijack our democracy and steal seats on the United States Supreme Court” through “despicable lies, disgusting character assassination, a new low, even for them, falsely accusing an innocent person of being a sexual predator.” The ad is airing in 10 competitive House districts; in nine of them, the Democrat had outraised the Republican through the end of last month. The Congressional Leadership Fund had raised $125 million through the end of last month, according to election commission filings, including $50 million from the Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam Adelson. They ranked as the biggest donors of disclosed money during the midterms, having donated $112 million to Republican super PACs through the end of last month, and the talk in Republican finance circles is that the Adelsons are considering giving more. Brian Baker, the president of a super PAC called Future45 and a political adviser to the Ricketts family, major donors to Republican and conservative causes, said that “it’s difficult to compete with the Democrats’ funding, but we are trying to help level the playing field so that their message isn’t the only one voters hear.” The fund-raising reports for Future45 show that it raised less than $105,000 between the beginning of 2017 and the end of last month. But it appears to have received a late influx of cash, since it reported spending more than $4 million this month on a nationwide advertising campaign. Its ad asserts that “voting for any Democrat” will empower “the far left moving to socialism, undefended open borders, immediate tax increases, 100 percent government-run health care,” as well as “the screaming, the violence, the smears and death threats” of angry mobs. “Most strategists will say that if you’re the party in power in a midterm, you should localize,” Mr. Baker acknowledged. “But this is already a national election, and rather than walking away from that, we are embracing it and trying to expose the extreme elements of the Democratic Party, and what they’d do if they win the majority.” At least some major Republican donors appear to be on board with the themes that Mr. Trump and supportive super PACs are using to try to nationalize the race. “These attacks on free enterprise, and the idea that we want to go to socialism, which has failed throughout history, is scary to me,” said Frank VanderSloot, who owns an Idaho-based health and home products company called Melaleuca. The company has donated $500,000 to Congressional Leadership Fund, while Mr. VanderSloot and his family have donated another $285,000 to Republican candidates and committees. “What’s driving me is to try to protect America as we know it,” Mr. VanderSloot said. He said he does not always like Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and “his attacking of individuals.” But he said he supports the president’s deregulation and tax-cutting measures, adding that he gave $2 million worth of bonuses to his employees after the tax cuts. “The overall climate for business I think is greatly improved,” he said. “Our sales are way up. When you have people with more money, they buy your product.”",The New York Times
2018,Republicans Look to Safety Net Programs as Deficit Balloons,"WASHINGTON — With the federal deficit growing and President Trump suddenly talking about another tax cut, the conversation in Washington has turned to the inevitable question of how — or whether — Congress will engage in any type of fiscal discipline. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and Kentucky Republican, got people in Washington talking — and generated some new campaign ads from Democrats — when he suggested this month that changes to Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid were needed to tame the deficit. So what does that presage should Republicans maintain control of Congress? This month, the Treasury Department recorded a $779 billion deficit for the 2018 fiscal year, stemming in large part from a sharp decline in corporate tax revenues after a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year. Since Republicans have historically made deficits a big talking point, Mr. McConnell was naturally asked what the heck he was going to do about it. “It’s disappointing, but it’s not a Republican problem,” Mr. McConnell told Bloomberg News in an interview. “It’s a bipartisan problem: unwillingness to address the real drivers of the debt by doing anything to adjust those programs to the demographics of America in the future.” That is code for wanting to tackle entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, which Republicans say need to be reined in to address the ballooning federal deficit. In the Capitol Hill language of indirection, Mr. McConnell’s response most likely served two purposes: to signal to his party’s base that, yes, deficits still make Republicans in Congress sad, but, no, the tax cuts are not to blame. President Trump has shown little interest in taking on the programs that are swelling as the baby boom ages — Social Security and Medicare — and Mr. McConnell further signaled inaction. “There’s nothing on our agenda to do that unless we have an agreement with the Democrats that we can all sign on to,” he told reporters later. Still, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said in a recent interview that the administration had to be tougher on spending and would begin to consider “the larger entitlements” — Social Security and Medicare are the two biggest social insurance programs — “probably next year.” Even if the Republicans maintain control of Congress, they are likely to lack the votes to make major overhauls to the big entitlement programs, especially without the president’s support. So they would have to turn to the budget process trick — most likely in the first half of 2019 — that allows the Senate to pass legislation with only 51 votes. There are limits to that process, but Republicans’ myriad efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act provide a guide. The bill, which ultimately failed, would have turned Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, into block grants to the states while slowly rolling back its expansion under the Affordable Care Act and squeezing overall spending on the program. “Last year when we were taking a run at repealing Obamacare, there was a very serious effort to reform Medicaid,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. “We got close to uniting Republican senators on the idea that not only do we need to change the architecture of the program but also long-term growth of the program.” This would be their easiest play, especially if the Republican majority expands in the Senate. “If Republicans keep the House, I have no doubt they will redouble their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and slash funding,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the program, in an email. Indeed, if Republicans keep control of Congress, they might view this as a mandate from voters. Republicans have long toyed with the notion of allowing some private investments in Social Security, but there has been no serious legislative attempt since President George W. Bush was smacked down when he tried to change the program in 2005. President Barack Obama offered some cuts in Social Security in exchange for new revenues in the “grand bargain” he pursued with the House speaker at the time, John Boehner, toward the end of both of their terms. But House Republicans rejected that notion, and it collapsed under the weight of partisan brawls. Further, the retirement program is generally considered less of a threat to fiscal solvency than Medicare since its outlays are not expanding as fast as the health programs. [Read more about campaign pledges regarding Social Security.] And given the political polarization, Democrats and Republicans are unlikely to agree on a plan to overhaul the program, which would be necessary for any major changes. The Republican agenda still officially calls for turning Medicare into a voucherlike program that would give recipients a choice of whether to get subsidies to buy private insurance or maintain traditional coverage. Again, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he does not want to make changes to this program for older Americans, though he has spoken frequently about trying to lower the costs of drugs in Medicare, including by increasing the government’s power to negotiate prices. Well, congressional Republicans don’t want the government to negotiate drug prices — that’s an idea pushed by Democrats. Congress has already made modest moves on the drug-pricing front. “The tax cuts kind of poisoned the well on this,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow in budget, tax and economics at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. He noted: “It’s hard to cut taxes for corporations and then cut Medicare. The optics for that can be brutal.” On Thursday, Mr. Trump released his latest drug-price ideas, which would essentially base the costs on those paid by other industrialized nations. “If Republicans retain the Senate, they will do everything they can to take away families’ health care and raise their costs,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader from New York, said in response to Mr. McConnell. “Americans should take Senator McConnell at his word.” Right away, the comments became the subject of ads; Priorities USA Action, the largest Democratic Party “super PAC,” dumped an immediate $2 million into the effort, and others joined the fray. Expect to see more of this as Democrats try to turn their closing message before the midterm elections back to health care, as they had already been trying to do Yes, Republicans are embracing legislative efforts that would allow states to employ work requirements to lower the food stamp rolls. They will get a lot of pushback from Democrats, whose votes they need to pass the bill.

2018,Republicans Rushing to Save House Seats From Onslaught of Democratic Money,"CINCINNATI — As the 2018 midterm campaign enters its final full week, House Republicans are rushing to fortify their defenses in conservative-leaning districts they thought were secure, pouring millions of dollars into a last-minute bid to build a new firewall against Democrats. Republicans, in defending a 23-seat majority, are likely to lose a handful of open or Democratic-tilting seats as well as another dozen suburban districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, according to political strategists in both parties. But now Republican officials are increasingly concerned about Democratic incursions in some of the remaining 30 competitive districts on the House map where the Republican candidates thought they had an edge. For the final two weeks of the election, Democratic campaigns and outside groups are on track to substantially outspend Republicans, strategists on both sides say. Democrats are set to spend $143 million on television advertising in House races, compared with $86 million for Republicans, according to one analysis by a Democratic strategist tracking media buys. Democratic super PACs and other outside groups are poised to outspend their Republican counterparts by a wide margin, erasing an advantage Republicans planned on having. Much of the Democrats’ unanticipated firepower comes from one source: Michael R. Bloomberg, the liberal former New York City mayor who may run for president, plans to spend about $20 million on House advertising through his super PAC, Independence USA, in the final week of the campaign, a Bloomberg adviser said. With Democratic challengers out-raising their opponents in more than 100 districts last quarter and President Trump energizing the left as well as his own base, well-financed House Republican groups are scrambling to put down emerging threats in states like Florida and Washington while augmenting existing spending in Kansas, Virginia and Minnesota. [Read about the political motivations of people who recently made their first donations to an election campaign.] In a Florida district that includes northern Palm Beach County, where Republicans have swept in in the closing days of the race, first-term Representative Brian Mast said he welcomed the help. “I don’t like being hit over the head by outside groups,” Mr. Mast said. The midterm campaign has returned to the sort of bipolar dynamic that defined it at the start of the year. Senate Republicans are confident once again in retaining their one-seat majority in that chamber thanks to a favorable map of races. But Democrats are poised to pick up an array of governorships in major states and could dislodge Republicans’ eight-year hold on the House. Republicans hope they can keep the House if they sweep the closest races, a tall order given the Democratic enthusiasm in many districts. But much of the Republican spending is aimed less at securing a majority than at limiting the breadth of a Democratic takeover as the field of competition grows well beyond 40 seats. “It’s the suburban seats and it’s the flow of money,” Representative Tom Cole, a longtime Oklahoma Republican and former House campaign chairman, said of the party’s two overriding concerns. Many Democrats remain deeply scarred by Mr. Trump’s victory, memories that have been unnervingly revived by the recent spike in conservative enthusiasm. But unlike at this moment in the presidential election, when Mrs. Clinton sought to harden her party’s putative blue wall, it is Republicans who are on the defensive in the battle for the House, with the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership — the two main groups financing Republican advertising — routing money anew into campaigns. “Some of the guys who should be in trouble are doing O.K.,” said Michael Steel, a longtime House Republican strategist, alluding to lawmakers in districts Mr. Trump lost or only narrowly carried. “But there appear to be little fires everywhere.” The biggest danger for Republicans in House races remains in the moderate suburbs of blue states like New York, New Jersey and California, where they could lose up to a dozen seats — half their margin of control. Then there are a handful of other affluent districts just outside other cities where voters have recoiled from Mr. Trump’s divisive style of politics. “I think we’ll have a suburban wave,” said Liesl Hickey, a former executive director of the N.R.C.C. “A lot of the districts that we are most likely to lose are Democratic-leaning, they’re just going to what their modern DNA is.” But what poses so much peril for Republicans is that a surge of donations to all manner of Democratic candidates has allowed them to go on offense in districts that had received far less attention and money. Those races in more conservative, exurban areas could make the difference between Democrats winning a splinter-thin majority or claiming a firm grasp on the House. Mr. Trump’s standing in these districts is not as dismal as it is in those races Republicans are likely to lose. But two years after he carried the districts, his conduct in office has pushed his disapproval ratings to about the same level of his approval ratings. And with Democrats enjoying an advantage on intensity and money, and Republicans in many of these races unprepared for the scale of both, Republicans are vulnerable. For example, officials in both parties have long viewed Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois as at risk because he represents an upscale, Chicagoland district that backed Mrs. Clinton. But now Representative Randy Hultgren, a Republican hailing from a more far-flung Chicago suburb that backed Mr. Trump, also appears in jeopardy. Mr. Hultgren’s Democratic opponent, Lauren Underwood, raised over $2 million in the last quarter while he took in $455,000. It is a similar story in North Carolina, where Mr. Trump touched down on Friday to help a couple of Republican candidates running in conservative districts near Charlotte who have been out-raised by Democrats and have had to rely out on outside groups. “This is a tough environment for Republicans and when you get outspent two to one or three to one over the last few weeks you’re asking for trouble,” said Corry Bliss, who runs the House Republican super PAC and has been forced to fill that gap between Republicans and better-funded rivals. In a particularly frustrating development for Republican leaders, they are racing to protect two House seats they had already spent tens of millions of dollars defending in special elections: one anchored in suburban Atlanta’s Cobb County and the other in central Ohio. In the Georgia seat, Republicans say a combination of robust Democratic turnout — propelled by Stacey Abrams’s campaign for governor — and a heavy financial investment by Mr. Bloomberg has put them unexpectedly on defense. Tilting the political map further, Mr. Bloomberg’s group is also financing ads in two other conservative-leaning suburban districts long viewed as relatively safe by Republicans: one held by Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, the other a seat in the suburbs of Jacksonville, Fla., that former Representative Ron DeSantis vacated to run for governor. Republicans are straining to keep up. Just in the last few days, Republican committees have spent millions on Ms. Herrera Beutler and Mr. Mast of Florida — both of whom hold center-right, outer-suburban districts — as well as for a couple of conservative open seats in Virginia and Florida. At the same time, they have added additional funding into a Virginia Beach-based district and seats in southern Minnesota, in suburban Des Moines and around Topeka, Kan. “We’re now seeing opportunities that we didn’t think would be there,” said Representative Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, adding: “I do feel confident that we’re going to get the majority and then some.” Former Representative Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, a Republican who served as vice chairman of the party’s campaign committee, said Republicans faced races that were “tightening up” across the board, especially in diverse suburbs and districts full of right-of-center “soccer moms.” He said Republicans stood a chance to hold the House if some of those moderate women returned to the fold. The difference between a narrowly held Democratic House, or even one with the barest of Republican majorities, will most likely turn on about 20 districts that Mr. Trump won comfortably but not overwhelmingly and that contain a mix of new developments as well as smaller, older communities. Many of these seats were gerrymandered by Republican state legislators to protect incumbents, but that was in the pre-Trump era, when Republicans could more reliably count on the votes of moderate women. “They have an assumption about that voter and their fidelity to the Republican Party that is not true under Donald Trump,” said Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former House Democratic campaign chief, of voters he called “anti-Hillary but never pro-Trump.” Republicans in some once-safe districts expressed confidence they would hang on. In the Cincinnati area, Representative Steve Chabot is counting on the addition of a heavily Republican exurban county that was added to his district to ward off a well-funded challenge from Aftab Pureval, the 36-year-old Hamilton County clerk who raised over twice what Mr. Chabot did in the last quarter. “One of the things he has been successful at is raising a boatload of money,” Mr. Chabot acknowledged. He lost his seat once before when Barack Obama was at the top of the 2008 ticket and had to win it back two years later, but he said he felt assured of his success this time. Mr. Chabot said that his race was “not really” competitive and that he might win by over six points. On his way to pick up a few dozen Xavier University students to caravan with them to an early voting site, Mr. Pureval said that he had his “eyes wide open” about the difficulty of the district and that he was counting on a wave of energy to overcome the Republican gerrymander. One danger for Republicans may be lawmakers who have never faced true political combat. Some in the party fear Representative Rob Woodall of Georgia may have waited too long to take his race seriously. Mr. Woodall, who holds a rapidly diversifying suburban district, has yet to run a single television ad, and Democratic polling in the governor’s race has shown Ms. Abrams with a solid lead in the area. Carolyn Bourdeaux, the Democrat challenging Mr. Woodall, said she was mystified by his approach to the campaign. Ms. Bourdeaux has raised far more money than Mr. Woodall and finished September with about $273,000 more in the bank than he had. Unchallenged on television, she has positioned herself as a nonthreatening moderate in a changing district and has declined to endorse left-wing priorities like single-payer health care. “He has not put together a particularly aggressive campaign at all,” Ms. Bourdeaux said of Mr. Woodall.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Republicans for Democrats,"Conservative readers explain how and why they will vote against Trump this year. Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Ross Douthat has a suggestion for Republican voters who don’t like President Trump: Go ahead and vote Republican in any Senate races — but vote for your local Democratic House candidate, as a check on Trump. He explained his thinking on this week’s episode of our podcast, “The Argument,” and we invited listeners to tell us their own thoughts. The responses have been fascinating, and I want to share a few here: Mary Beth Hunt: “I am a lifelong moderate Republican despairing over the current situation. I am appalled by Trump and fearful of his authoritarian rhetoric and behavior. The lack of checks and balances that should limit presidential authority deeply concerns me, as does the undermining of institutions (the free press, for example) that support a healthy democracy. “I voted in 2016 but was unable to vote for either Trump or Clinton. In the midterms, I will vote for Democratic candidates for House, Senate, and governor. I’m holding my nose to do it, but I hope there are enough like-minded people to check Trump’s power. I fear we are watching the demise of our democracy, and desperate times call for desperate measures!” [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Richard Wright: “I am a former lifelong Republican (became independent after Trump’s nomination), a Burkean conservative reader of National Review and Commentary, and Ross, along with David Brooks, are two of my current ideological guideposts. I have already mailed in my [Florida] ballot in which I did exactly as Ross proposed: Dem for the House, Rep for the Senate, and a write in of Jeb Bush for Gov. since Gillum is too far to the left and Desantis is too much a Trump sycophant.” Eric Morgan: “I am a lifelong Republican, having voted with the party in every presidential election since the first Reagan term. I was never a [Bill] Clinton fan and in the current #metoo world we live in his legacy has not aged well in my opinion. So it was with a clothespin upon nose and a very heavy heart that I pulled the lever for Hillary in 2016. “So, I count myself among the Never Trumpers who has taken the previously inconceivable action of voting for not only a Democrat but one of the most deeply flawed candidates in my lifetime. Here is the good news — I live in Utah and will vote for Mitt Romney who has shown the courage to speak out against the most flawed President since Nixon. I hope he doesn’t let us down.” Lynn Schmidt: “I am a Never Trump former Republican. I live in Missouri where we have Senator McCaskill running against Josh Hawley. Josh is a Trump lackey. I will be voting for and even have donated money to several Democratic campaigns. As a mother of a child with a disability, I got off the Trump bandwagon when he made fun of the reporter with a disability. I was a delegate to the 2012 RNC but would not even attend our state convention if that meant supporting Trump. I am no longer a Republican if the G.O.P. is the Party of Trump. I am disappointed every day by our president. There are currently no checks and balances. That is what I am voting for, checks and balances.” For more on this topic, you can read some of the conservatives who have grown disillusioned with the Republican Party, including: Jay Caruso of The Dallas Morning News, writing a piece in The Atlantic called “I’m Not Leaving the Republican Party;” The Washington Post’s George Will urging Republicans to vote against their party; Mona Charen, about an on-stage encounter early this year; Max Boot, on quitting the G.O.P.; and Jonathan Chait on the importance of Boot’s attack on the party.

2018,Rescue Teams Scour Ruins as Hurricane Death Toll Rises,"SPRINGFIELD, Fla. — Hurricane Michael’s death toll rose to 16 on Friday and was expected to climb higher as emergency workers searched rubble and the storm’s grim consequences stretched from the Florida Panhandle into Virginia. Rescue teams combed a region razed by a Category 4 hurricane that flattened blocks, collapsed buildings and left infrastructure crippled. Some of the hardest-hit communities have yet to report fatalities, and although officials said they hoped they would find survivors, a resigned gloom was setting in throughout the disaster zone. Here’s the latest: • At a news conference Friday afternoon in Marianna, Fla., Sheriff Lou Roberts confirmed three storm-related deaths in Jackson County. • The authorities in Virginia said five people had died, including several who had drowned and a firefighter who was responding to an emergency call. Two other people were feared dead. • Four deaths occurred in Gadsden County, west of Tallahassee, according to Lt. Anglie Hightower, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office. The victims included a man who died when a tree crashed down on his home in Greensboro. • An 11-year-old girl, Sarah Radney, was killed on Wednesday when a carport was torn away and was sent hurtling into a modular home in Seminole County, Ga. • North Carolina officials reported two more deaths on Friday, raising the death toll there to three. The authorites said a man and a woman had died in McDowell County when their car struck a large tree that had fallen in a road. • At least 1.5 million customers were without electricity in states stretching from Florida to Virginia. • Many health institutions in Florida remained closed, including four hospitals, 13 nursing homes and 14 assisted living facilities, according to information distributed at a senior federal leadership briefing on Friday and shared with The New York Times. The figures were slightly higher than those distributed by Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration. Several dialysis centers were also closed. • President Trump said on Friday that he would visit Florida and Georgia next week. “People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great state of Georgia,” he said on Twitter. • It has been a tough few weeks for the Carolinas. After thrashing the Florida Panhandle, Michael slogged through states still reeling from the effects of Hurricane Florence last month. • Much of the coast of the Florida Panhandle, including Mexico Beach and Panama City, was devastated. The area is dotted with small, rural communities, some of them among the poorest in the state. Read more about how the storm was hard on people without the means to evacuate. Roy Radney, Sarah Radney’s father, said his daughter had gone to visit her grandparents earlier in the week while she and her siblings were on fall break. As the storm churned through the part of southwest Georgia where the grandparents lived, Mr. Radney, 37, called to check in at least once an hour, and sometimes every 15 minutes. Things were fine at first. But then he got a call from his brother. The reception was bad and Mr. Radney could not quite make out what his brother was saying. But he could tell he was crying. “When I finally got through and spoke to my mom, my mom said Sarah had been hit in the head,” Mr. Radney said. The wind, he was told, had lifted up a portable carport that had been behind the house and thrust it toward the home. One of its legs burst through and struck both Sarah and Mr. Radney’s mother. His mother’s lung was punctured, her rib broken. Sarah’s head injury left her gasping for air for 45 minutes to an hour. “Last night was just hell,” Mr. Radney said. “I’m an hour and a quarter away, and my daughter’s dying, and I can’t do anything about it. I can’t think of anything that is more related to hell than that.” Then, finally, Mr. Radney and his wife got through again, and his father told Mr. Radney’s wife that Sarah had died. “And that’s about the end of the story,” Mr. Radney said. [Read more about Mr. Radney’s memories of Sarah here.] Most of the people who died in Virginia were drowning victims; another was a firefighter who had responded to a car crash on an interstate highway. The firefighter, Lt. Brad Clack of the Hanover County Fire-EMS Department, was one of four firefighters struck by their fire engine when a tractor-trailer slammed into it, pushing it into them, around 9 p.m. on Thursday outside Richmond, according to the Virginia State Police. Mr. Clack was at the scene of a two-vehicle crash on Interstate 295 during the storm. The fire engine’s lights were on, and the roads were slick when it was struck by the tractor-trailer on the side of the road, the police said. The driver of the tractor-trailer suffered serious injuries, the police said, and charges were pending. The other three firefighters were taken to a hospital in serious condition. One of the drowning victims died in Charlotte County, near the North Carolina border, after a car was swept away on a bridge on Thursday night, according to the state police. Two other people were in the car, with one rescued and the other missing. Earlier on Thursday, James King Jr., 45, was swept away in his car in floodwaters in Pittsylvania County in southern Virginia around 3:30 p.m. and could not be rescued despite the efforts of sheriff’s deputies, the state police said. “The floodwaters were too deep and too swift for them to maintain contact with him,” the police said. And two people were killed in Danville, Va., on Thursday when their cars were overrun by flash flooding. William Lynn Tanksley, 53, died when the car he was in was swept away in fast-moving water around 5 p.m., the Danville Police Department said. Jennifer Bjarnesen Mitchell, 60, died around 10:20 p.m. when the vehicle she was in got stuck in high water. A motorist was also reported missing in Nottoway County. The vehicle was recovered, but the person who was in the vehicle had not been found. As the death toll rose in Virginia, the authorities expected more deaths to be reported farther south along the hurricane’s path. “I expect the fatality count to come up today. I expect it to come up tomorrow, as well, as we get through the debris,” Brock Long, the chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in an interview with CNN on Friday. “Hopefully it doesn’t rise dramatically, but it is a possibility.” [Here is why a death might be considered storm related in one state and not another.] Government officials were racing Friday to find a way to get food and water to the increasingly desperate people of the Florida Panhandle. “When is anybody coming to do something?” said Trenisa Smith, 48, a school bus driver in Springfield who had been giving herself insulin treatments in the back of her car. “I’m worried every day.” In the immediate aftermath of the storm, it was becoming clear that many residents were not only left without a habitable home, but also without adequate stockpiles of food. Some residents were doing what they could to find food or water, including rummaging through stores that had been damaged. One man said he had been driving to the nearby bay and filling buckets with water to flush the toilets. Carl Jones, 43, said that he had seen no hint of government response as of Thursday night — “only thing is the police came and said you’ve got to be inside” at nightfall, he said. [Read more about the desperation among Panhandle residents.] The seaside community of Mexico Beach, where the storm made landfall, was a flattened wreck. Across the small sport-fishing town, piers and docks were destroyed, fishing boats were piled crazily on shore and residents wandered the streets in horror and wonder. “These were all block and stucco houses — gone,” the former mayor, Tom Bailey, said. “The mother of all bombs doesn’t do any more damage than this.” Mr. Long, the administrator of FEMA, said that emergency responders were focused on Friday morning on search-and-rescue efforts in Mexico Beach and other hard-hit areas, including inland communities. Emergency responders are expected to complete all of the “initial” search-and-rescue missions by the end of Friday in both Florida and Georgia, he said. The road to Mexico Beach became passable Thursday morning, less than 24 hours after Michael made landfall, and it became evident that few communities had suffered more. The town of about 2,000 permanent residents swells to as many as 14,000 in July, and is known for having a relaxed feel compared with the brash tourist strips of Panama City Beach or the tony nearby beach developments of Alys Beach or Seaside. “So many lives have been changed forever, so many families have lost everything,” Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said. “Homes are gone, businesses are gone. Roads and infrastructure along the storm’s path have been destroyed. This hurricane was an absolute monster.” Mr. Long was visibly frustrated over reports that residents of the Panhandle coast had ignored state and federal warnings to evacuate before the hurricane arrived. He said that an estimated 13-foot storm surge, not high winds, had reduced homes to piles of wood and debris. The homes that were still intact, at least partly, were most likely built higher off the ground, allowing the rushing ocean to pass underneath, Mr. Long said. “There’s a lesson here about building codes.” He asked for patience, especially in the area around Mexico Beach and Panama City as workers tried to clear streets, safely remove downed power lines, and secure ruptured gas lines. One challenge has been communication, Mr. Long said, and officials are working to allow wireless companies access to the areas to restore cellphone service. It may be some time, he said, before people can return home. “Bottom line, it was one of the most powerful storms the country has seen since 1851,” he said. “It’s going to be a long time before they can get back.” [Click on the image below to get a sense of the scale of the destruction in Mexico Beach.] We analyzed aerial images of Mexico Beach, Fla., and found that at least three-quarters of the buildings along a one-mile stretch were destroyed or severely damaged. While the coastal devastation has become obvious, some disaster experts are most concerned about the conditions farther inland. Andrew Schroeder, research and analytics director for Direct Relief, said data analyzed by his humanitarian organization showed that people from the coasts had evacuated relatively short distances, to areas that the storm also raked with high winds and cut power lines. [Here is how you can help victims of Hurricane Michael.] “These are some of the most socially vulnerable places in the entire country,” Mr. Schroeder said, low-income counties with high proportions of older adults, and many people with disabilities and chronic illnesses. These inland areas were “where the focus has to be,” he said. But assessing the impact will take time. “You only find out about a lot of this stuff after the peak of the attention curve.” The photographers Gabriella Angotti-Jones, Emily Kask, Scott McIntyre, Johnny Milano and Eric Thayer are on the ground in Florida covering the storm for The New York Times. See their images here. Hurricane Michael could inflict wind and storm-surge losses of up to $4.5 billion, according to CoreLogic, a data-analytics company in Irvine, Calif., that bases its estimates on the replacement cost of houses and other structures in the paths of major storms before they hit. Sharper estimates are expected in the coming weeks, as homeowners report their actual losses to insurers. Property insurers in Florida tend to be younger, smaller companies than those elsewhere, but analysts said they appeared adequately cushioned with reinsurance and were expected to bounce back. CoreLogic’s estimate does not include the cost of flood damage, which is borne by the National Flood Insurance Program, operated by FEMA. Standard homeowners’ policies do not cover flood damage, and people who live on designated floodplains are required to buy $250,000 worth of coverage from the federal program. The requirement has been hard to enforce, though, and many people who should have the insurance do not. An unknown number of F-22 stealth fighters, each costing $339 million, were left behind at Tyndall Air Force Base and probably damaged when Hurricane Michael hit the Panhandle on Wednesday. Photos and video from the wreckage of the base, where hangars were shredded, showed the distinctive contours of the stealth fighter’s squared tail fins and angled vertical stabilizers jumbled in the wreckage of the base’s largest building, Hangar 5. Another photo shows the jet in a smaller hangar that had its doors ripped off. An Air Force spokeswoman, Maj. Malinda Singleton, acknowledged that some aircraft at the base had been damaged but would not confirm that they were F-22s. “A number of aircraft were left behind in hangars due to maintenance or safety reasons, and all of those hangars are damaged,” Major Singleton said. “We anticipate the aircraft parked inside may be damaged as well, but we won’t know the extent until our crews can safely enter those hangars and make an assessment. Tyndall Air Force had 55 F-22 fighters, according to a base briefing, but not all of the high-tech and notoriously finicky jets are always flight-worthy. An Air Force report this year found on average only about 49 percent of F-22s were ready at any given time. Earlier this week, a spokeswoman for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio said 33 of Tyndall’s fighters had arrived for safekeeping. It is unclear if the other 22 fighters — or about 12 percent of the Air Force’s total fleet — are still on the damaged base. [Read more here about how many of the buildings there were “a complete loss.”] The storm’s effects reached deep into the Panhandle. In the town of Marianna, more than 60 miles northeast of Panama City, roofs were torn off buildings, pine trees had snapped, and piles of bricks were tossed across downtown streets. The Sunland Center for adults with developmental disabilities was without regular power or landline phone service and its grounds were strewn with debris, said Melanie Etters with the Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities. She said a truck had delivered food, water, ice and generator fuel to the state-run center, which has about 325 residents, some of them older adults and many of whom require significant assistance with basic activities. She said the center had generators, and its staff were able to communicate with state officials by cellphone. Some family members of residents, who have conditions including autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, took to social media in the hours after the storm, pleading for information because they could not contact the center by phone. Ms. Etters said there were no reported injuries and no plans to evacuate the center. On a normal day, Ms. Etters said, residents participate in programs involving animals and a recycling workshop, and they shop at their own mall.",The New York Times
2018,Rescue Workers Search for Missing After Typhoon Strikes Philippines,"MANILA — Rescue workers in the Philippines were still searching on Wednesday for missing people at the site of a landslide, a day after a typhoon brought heavy rains to the country’s north, officials said. By Wednesday afternoon, nine bodies had been recovered from the site in the town of Natonin, in Mountain Province, where the landslide buried a government building on Tuesday afternoon as Typhoon Yutu cut across the northern Philippines. Fourteen people had been rescued and nine were still missing, officials said. “Responders had a difficult time going to the area, so I requested two air force helicopters with a search and rescue team and their equipment and K9 dogs,” said Ruben Carandang, an official who was leading the local relief operation. Mr. Carandang said government engineers, contractors and several evacuees taking refuge from the typhoon were believed to have been in the building when the landslide struck. In the nearby town of Banaue, which was also hit by a landslide, volunteers retrieved the bodies of four people, two of them children, the government said. Flash floods swamped at least two schools in the province of Kalinga. But classes had been canceled because of the typhoon, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. Richard Gordon, a senator who is also the chairman of the Philippine Red Cross, said the organization had sent earth-moving equipment to help with the search in Natonin. “We will do what needs to be done to bring hope to people who are extremely vulnerable,” he said. “We should all pray.” He added that emergency meals and other relief items had been sent to storm-damaged areas in the north. Typhoon Yutu, called Rosita in the Philippines, affected nearly 40,000 people, including many who fled to evacuation centers. Its winds of over 90 miles per hour blew away tin roofs and toppled trees as it cut a swath of destruction westward. By Wednesday morning, the typhoon had weakened as it exited the country, the state weather agency said. Tropical cyclone warnings were posted in about 30 Philippine provinces, including in the capital, Manila, where most of the day was rainy. Classes in many areas were also suspended Tuesday, while up to 30 domestic and international flights were canceled. Yutu was the 18th typhoon of the season to hit the Philippines, which endures 20 or so every year, some of them devastating. It came just a month after the powerful Typhoon Mangkhut cut a similar path, dumping heavy rains across a large area of the northern island of Luzon and causing landslides that left at least 150 dead. Mangkhut was the most powerful storm to hit the archipelago since 2013, when Typhoon Haiyan killed thousands. Yutu struck the American territory of the Northern Mariana Islands last week, tearing through Saipan and Tinian and destroying buildings, though only one person was reported to have been killed.",The New York Times
2018,Rescuing Sea Turtles From Fishermen’s Nets,"An organization on the coast of Kenya tries to persuade local residents to help return the trapped reptiles to the ocean, rather than sell their meat and shells for a living. A green sea turtle trapped in a gill net. Scientists estimate the global green turtle population has declined 50 to 70 percent since 1900.CreditCreditJeff Rotman/Science Source WATAMU, Kenya — The young hawksbill turtle was accidentally caught in a net in the Indian Ocean off Kenya’s coast. The fisherman called Local Ocean Conservation, a nonprofit based in the town of Watamu that is the only turtle rescue and rehabilitation center on the East African seaboard. The hawksbill, critically endangered in this region, was a mere seven pounds; adults can weigh up to 160 pounds. X-rays showed that the reptile’s intestinal tract was clogged with plastic. Hogaar, as Local Ocean named her, floated and couldn’t dive. Gas had built up in her innards after she had eaten small pieces of plastic mistaken for food such as jellyfish. Local Ocean staff members placed Hogaar in a rehab pool and gave her laxatives. She passed feces laced with shreds of packaging and had little appetite. After more than four months at Local Ocean, Hogaar died. A necropsy revealed her gut was also full of sharp shards of white, blue and pink plastic and tangles of blue and gray string. Turtles are reptiles that have existed for at least 110 million years and survived the mass extinction that killed off dinosaurs. But today, sea turtles worldwide are threatened with extinction. And it’s estimated that only one of 1,000 turtle eggs laid survive to adulthood. Worldwide, hawksbills are critically endangered, while green and loggerhead turtles are endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Olive ridleys and leatherbacks are vulnerable. All five species of these sea turtles are found in Kenyan waters. The global green turtle population has declined by an estimated 50 to 70 percent since 1900. Conservationists are trying to protect turtles from a wave of threats, including pollution. Since its founding in 1997, Local Ocean has protected about 1,000 nests, conducted more than 17,000 turtle rescues and treated more than 480 turtles in its rehab center. About 60 to 70 percent of turtles are released back in the ocean. Ten to 15 percent of the center’s turtle patients are sick from eating plastic. Most of them do not survive. Spiky papillae lining turtles’ throats prevent them from regurgitating plastic. And surgery on gastrointestinal tracts is difficult to do if it requires breaking open their shells. Because some turtles presumably die in the ocean, there is no reliable estimate of how many are harmed by plastics. But there is no doubt plastic pollution is growing; three-quarters of marine litter is now composed of plastic and tons of plastic waste get dumped into the ocean every year, according to a 2017 report from the United Nations Environment Assembly. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] An obscene rainbow of plastic debris washes up on Kenya’s beaches, drifting there from as far away as Madagascar and Malaysia according to labels still legible on items. Local Ocean’s volunteers collect the garbage, in sacks bulging with plastic lids, bottles, toothbrushes, yogurt cups, food packaging and more. Turtles face many other dangers, including fishermen’s hooks, boat accidents and habitat loss resulting from erosion and human construction — especially those obstructing nesting sites. They also suffer from ailments such as fibropapillomatosis, a mysterious disease that causes grotesque tumors possibly caused by pollution, and parasitic barnacles on their carapaces. Poaching for turtle meat, shells, oil and eggs is also a major threat. Just a few decades ago in Florida and Hawaii, green turtles were killed en masse for food. In Kenya, eating turtles is part of its coastal culture and the marine reptiles are a source of meat and income for families eking out a living. While poaching of any endangered species is illegal in Kenya and carries a fine of $200,000, enforcement against killing turtles is rare. While the plight of Africa’s endangered megafauna — elephants and rhinos — captures the world’s attention and resources, awareness and protection of marine life along the continent’s coastal areas are “completely overlooked,” said Nicky Parazzi, a founder of Local Ocean, which was previously called Watamu Turtle Watch. “What turtles need for their survival, we need for our enjoyment and survival as well. They represent the health of the ocean,” she said. “They are the canaries of the ocean.” One bright spot is the decline of poaching in the Watamu region, despite the big profit fishermen can make from selling oil and meat. A large female green turtle can yield up to 170 pounds of meat and up to 45 pounds of fat. Such a turtle can fetch $500 to $600 — a hefty sum considering the average fisherman here makes about $150 a month. Turtle oil sells on the black market for 2,000 shillings ($20) per bottle and is falsely believed to boost strength and immunity, cure asthma and serve as an aphrodisiac. Local Ocean staff members meet regularly with hundreds of fishermen to build trust and good relationships with the community. “We’ve been with them 20 years now,” Ms. Parazzi said. “We’re not fair weather friends, we’re not going anywhere.” Community liaison officers offer practical advice about sustainable fishing, which helps reduce poaching and encourages fishermen to participate in returning turtles accidentally caught back to the sea. They dissuade people from using illegal means to fish, such as mosquito nets, poison and spear guns that kill the largest fish carrying vital eggs. The organization also promotes small businesses like raising chickens, cultivating moringa plants and other agricultural products as part of its effort to reduce the area’s dependency on fishing. One spring morning, the fisherman Kai Shoka waited on a crescent-shaped beach here for Fikiri Kiponda, a turtle watch coordinator, after accidentally catching a juvenile hawksbill. On the beach, Mr. Kiponda measured and weighed the creature, and put metal identification tags on his flippers. Although hawksbill meat is poisonous, the turtles are prized for the painterly, amber patterns of their shells. Carapaces are made into “tortoiseshell” jewelry and trinkets, although trade is illegal under endangered species and Kenyan laws. Released soon afterward, this hawksbill crawled tentatively on the sand toward waves lapping the beach. Once in the water, the turtle flapped his flippers powerfully, becoming a rippling blur as he disappeared into the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean. The conservation group rewards fishermen for reporting any turtle bycatch: 300 shillings ($3) for small turtles and 1,000 shillings ($10) for large ones. Casper van de Geer, the organization’s manager, described the token amounts not as payments but as a way of compensating the fishermen for their time, or expenses like phone calls and transportation. “This is a small difference, but it has created a totally different attitude amongst the participants,” Mr. van de Geer said. While paying fishermen might seem to be an incentive for them to catch turtles, most fish by setting nets and waiting, making it unlikely that turtles are targeted for capture. Mr. Shoka, 40, said fishermen like him used to slaughter and eat turtles, but he considers the bycatch program worthwhile. “It’s illegal to possess turtle products,” he said. “You might be fined 20 million shillings. I don’t think selling the turtle is the proper thing.” The next morning, Mr. Kiponda drove to a village of thatch-roofed homes to pick up a 20-pound green turtle caught a day earlier by Mark Katama, 22, who had carried it home. “It’s a lot of effort because it’s struggling,” he said. “You have to be strong.” He received a $3 remuneration. With the turtle in a large box in the back of his jeep, Mr. Kiponda drove out of the village on muddy roads rutted by the country’s torrential spring rains. A former accountant, Mr. Kiponda reflected on his nine years as a conservationist with Local Ocean, and how the bycatch program has changed fishing practices in the area. He gets calls from fishermen nearly every day, but doubted that the program would be as popular if they didn’t get some reward. Given the financial difficulties that fishermen face, Mr. Kiponda speculated that without compensation, they “would go back to the tradition of eating them.” Poaching certainly still occurs, and there is little to stop it outside the Watamu area. A few days later, four people from Local Ocean using a harness strained to carry a massive green turtle — caught earlier by a fisherman — across the beach. Weighing 180 pounds, she exuded an all-knowing aura with her unblinking eyes set on a distinguished face. Set down on the white sand, the turtle used her foot-long, mosaic-patterned flippers to heave herself into the sea’s frothy waves, seemingly eager for another chance to live a long life that could last up to 80 years. In the late 1980s, Ms. Parazzi and a friend began patrolling the beach at night by flashlight, at a time when turtle and egg poaching was rampant in Watamu. “To see a turtle was quite unusual,” recalled Ms. Parazzi, who runs a crafts business. “We were just two housewives,” she said. “We didn’t know anything scientific whatsoever.” They sought out international turtle experts by email, asking such basic questions as what to do with a turtle nest. As their knowledge grew, the two women expanded their mission beyond the beach, and Local Ocean expanded to include a variety of programs, including mangrove reforestation, community economic development, outreach and education. “Our mandate is the environment,” Ms. Parazzi said. “We don’t believe in single-species conservation. It’s a fat lot trying to save the turtle if they have nowhere to nest.” The organization now employs about 20 Kenyans, with beach patrollers monitoring and protecting turtles during the nesting season. It also visits schools, offering education programs to thousands of students. At a beachfront apartment where Zachary Kibugu works as a security guard, a green turtle crawled into a cove choked with seaweed and an obstacle course of plastic garbage: sachets of juice and hair conditioner, old flip-flops, battered tubes of sunscreen, ubiquitous bottles and a medley of caps. The marine reptile dug a deep hole in the sand and laid 128 eggs, scraping sand with her flippers over the nest to hide it, and she lumbered back to the sea. Another security guard recognized the turtle’s telltale tracks and marked the nesting spot with sticks before the tide could erase it. Mr. Kibugu alerted Local Ocean, which had introduced him to sea turtles when the organization visited his high school several years ago. Later that morning, conservationists carefully dug up the trove of luminous white eggs the size of Ping-Pong balls. They would soon be reburied on a safer, cleaner beach where the nests could be monitored. As the staff members gingerly stacked the eggs into a plastic bucket, Mr. Kibugu remembered a Local Ocean field trip eight years ago when his class had released a rescued turtle back into the sea. The young man smiled brightly at the memory of giving the creature another chance.",The New York Times
2018,Researchers Explore a Cancer Paradox,"matter Healthy cells carry a surprising number of cancer-linked mutations, but they don’t turn into tumors. What’s holding them back? Cancer is a disease of mutations. Tumor cells are riddled with genetic mutations not found in healthy cells. Scientists estimate that it takes five to 10 key mutations for a healthy cell to become cancerous. Some of these mutations can be caused by assaults from the environment, such as ultraviolet rays and cigarette smoke. Others arise from harmful molecules produced by the cells themselves. In recent years, researchers have begun taking a closer look at these mutations, to try to understand how they arise in healthy cells, and what causes these cells to later erupt into full-blown cancer. The research has produced some major surprises. For instance, it turns out that a large portion of the cells in healthy people carry far more mutations than expected, including some mutations thought to be the prime drivers of cancer. These mutations make a cell grow faster than others, raising the question of why full-blown cancer isn’t far more common. “This is quite a fundamental piece of biology that we were unaware of,” said Inigo Martincorena, a geneticist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England. These lurking mutations went unnoticed for so long because the tools for examining DNA were too crude. If scientists wanted to sequence the entire genome of tumor cells, they had to gather millions of cells and analyze all of the DNA. A mutation, to be detectable, had to be very common. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] But as DNA sequencing grew more sophisticated, Dr. Martincorena and other researchers developed methods for detecting very rare mutations, and they began to wonder if those mutations might be found in healthy cells, hidden below the radar. Dr. Martincorena and his colleagues began their search in skin; its cells are battered daily by the sun’s ultraviolet rays, which trigger mutations. “We thought it was the lowest-hanging fruit,” Dr. Martincorena said. In a study in 2015, he and his colleagues collected bits of skin left over from cosmetic surgeries to lift drooping eyelids. They examined 234 biopsies from four patients, each sample of skin about the size of a pinhead. They gently coaxed the top layers of cells, known as epithelial cells, from the underlying tissue. Dr. Martincorena’s team then fished the DNA from the healthy epithelial cells, and carefully sequenced 74 genes that are known to play an important role in the development of cancer. Mutations that are common in cancer genes were remarkably common in these healthy skin cells, too, the researchers found. About one of every four epithelial cells carried a mutation on a cancer-linked gene, speeding up the cell’s growth. It was possible, the scientists knew, that skin was peculiar. Maybe inside the body, away from the onslaught of ultraviolet rays, were healthy cells that didn’t carry these key mutations. To find out, the researchers decided to study cells of the esophagus. The team gathered tissue samples from nine healthy organ donors who had died, then they sliced the tissue into dozens of tiny squares and examined the same 74 cancer-related genes. Dr. Martincorena and his colleagues found that new mutations arose more slowly in the esophagus than in skin. But once those mutations emerged, they caused the esophageal cells to multiply faster than normal esophageal cells. Over time, these rogue cells spread out across the esophagus, forming colonies of mutant cells, known as clones. Although these clones aren’t cancer, they do exhibit one of cancer’s hallmarks: rapid growth. “These mutant clones colonize more than half of your esophagus by middle age,” said Dr. Martincorena. “It was eye-opening for me.” Dr. Martincorena and his colleagues reported their findings on Thursday in the journal Science. By examining the mutations, the researchers were able to rule out external causes for them, like tobacco smoke or alcohol. Instead, the mutations seem to have arisen through ordinary aging. As the cells divided over and over again, their DNA sometimes was damaged. In other words, the rise of these mutations may just be an intrinsic part of getting older. “It seems that no matter how well one takes care of oneself by eating well, getting exercise and limiting certain vices, there’s likely only so much one can do against the need of the body to replace its cells,” said Scott Kennedy, a cancer biologist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study. The study also raised questions about efforts to detect cancer at its earliest stages, when cancer cells are still rare, Dr. Kennedy said: “Just because someone has mutations associated with cancer doesn’t mean actually they have a malignancy.” Given the abundance of cancer mutations in healthy people, why isn’t cancer more common? Dr. Martincorena speculated that a healthy body may be like an ecosystem: Perhaps clones with different mutations arise in it, compete for available space and resources, and keep each other in check. If so, fighting cancer might one day be a matter of helping harmless clones outcompete the ones that can lead to deadly tumors. “There is no therapy being thought out in these terms now,” said Dr. Martincorena. “But I think it opens up new avenues. I think knowledge is always a weapon.”",The New York Times
2018,"Resigned or Determined? After Kavanaugh, Women Are Pulled in Opposite Directions","The words they choose: Despair. Rage. Fear. Hopelessness. Determination. The bruising battle to confirm Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court may be over, but the reverberations for women who opposed him are not. In more than 50,000 responses to an invitation for women to share reactions about his confirmation battle, a wrenching question emerged about the hearing’s aftermath: Will the main result be resignation and withdrawal, or will it redouble activism and engagement? As those who lost this battle try to figure out how and whether to gird for the next ones, many women who opposed Justice Kavanaugh are pulled both ways. “I cried in the bathroom at work, I cried at home, I cried in the car, the whole time knowing that Brett Kavanaugh would inevitably end up on the Supreme Court,” wrote Katelyn Sullivan, a 27-year-old graphic designer from Burlington, Vt. “I waver between feeling the power of women’s anger and feeling like meaningful change is out of reach.” The responses ran the political gamut, with many also writing to support Justice Kavanaugh. “I think this became a political game with a lot of underhanded maneuvering,” wrote Anne Abraham, who identified herself as a first-generation immigrant from India living in Maryland. She said Justice Kavanaugh would uphold the constitution, and she would vote Republican as she has in the past. “I think it’s healthy for a nation to protest and voice their concerns. I think that it’s become unsafe in this country to be a conservative — especially in our cities and in popular culture.” But after two heady years of marching, organizing and running for office, after once-invulnerable men were toppled by accusations of sexual harassment, many women who opposed the nomination are asking themselves how much has really changed — and how much still can. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] Many listed specific actions they plan to take in the aftermath: vote, canvass, protest, write public officials, donate money. One woman said if, as she expects, abortions are further restricted, she would open her California home to women who needed to travel to obtain them. Another said she would launch a social media campaign describing her own sexual assault and listing others. Susan Daily of Kansas City, Mo., who described herself as a mother of twin daughters and married to a conservative she persuaded not to vote for President Trump, said she turned her Facebook profile into an oozing volcano after the hearings. She said she plans to show up in courtrooms to support victims of assault. And she has not given up on reaching across the divide. “I try to post uncomfortable truths to engage others who run across my newsfeed,” she wrote. “I engage civilly with conservatives and naysayers online.” But many women said the hearings had reminded them of the formidable barriers to change posed by an entrenched political structure still controlled by older white men. And some who were rooting for Democrats to win back Congress in the elections could not shake a dread that once more their side would lose. “I feel powerless to change anything, and I don’t think my vote even counts due to the Electoral College, but I do vote anyway out of principle,” wrote Ashley Silverthorne from Minnesota. “My foremothers fought for our right to vote and I’ll exercise it any time I can even though I don’t think it will change anything.” Laura Stahl, of Los Angeles, said she is resolved to vote. “But I am so afraid that my voice does not matter,” she wrote. “I feel as though I am screaming into the void. And yet I cannot be silent. I have to do something or else this hopelessness will paralyze me.” For these women, the hearings were a live, communal swing from jubilation that a female accuser was first seen as widely credible to disgust that male power once more ruled the day. They described feeling silenced and sidelined, not only by men, but in a singularly wrenching betrayal, by other women — those who voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh and those who believed him over his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. “I felt completely and utterly shut down,” wrote Nicole Keefler, an American living in Canada who is casting an absentee ballot in the midterm elections. “That none of our experiences of sexual violence matter. Nobody cares — not the police, the courts, the politicians or the president.” Even more, the hearings were a painful flashback to 2016, when Democratic women were shocked not only that Hillary Clinton lost, but that a man whose unapologetic embrace of swagger and sexual entitlement could be elected president. That explains a lingering intensity that has taken many of these women by surprise. “I had no idea that these hearings would affect me so deeply,” wrote Keirsten Hamilton, an attorney who said she was raised in a fairly conservative Christian home in small-town Texas, votes Republican in some local races but more often for Democrats. “It does feel, in many ways, like meaningful change is out of reach. But I’ve never felt so enraged in my life. I refuse to let men keep telling this narrative that I know is wrong.” [Here’s a guide to everything you need to know about the November elections.] As with both sides in this intensely partisan moment, Sarah Orlando of Houston evoked an apocalyptic future: “This is the worst thing that’s happened to women in my lifetime, I fear the worst is far from yet to come. I’m not just worried for women though. I’m worried for every marginalized community in America. When my son asked if everything was going to be O.K., I answered with my filter temporarily disengaged, ‘Just be glad you’re not a woman, honey.’” Some women reproached themselves as well as men in power, turning anger inward for somehow failing to do enough. “Honestly this makes me realize how inactive I have been,” wrote Raphaela Weissman of Seattle, who said she was voluble on social media but had not taken direct action. “I did not call any senators before this vote, so in a way this is my fault, too.” Allison Butz of Texas offered a vivid glimpse into modern-day juggling many women must navigate. She wrote that she had always voted, protested, written letters and volunteered for campaigns when she could. “But sweet Jesus, I’m the underpaid director of a severely underfunded community food pantry in a service area that has some of the highest rates of food insecurity in the entire nation. My husband and I own a print shop. I have two small children who are in school, in soccer, in other activities … and the birthday parties, constantly … and that doesn’t even touch on how I manage to keep the plates spinning in every other aspect of my life.” “I can’t add another commitment beyond what I’m already doing, and I feel like I’m letting the entirety of society down as a result,” she continued. “Moral of the story? Right now is bad.” Yet for many who responded, the prospect of more women in office remains alluring and hopeful. Magaly Marques, who described herself as a manager, mother and immigrant, wrote: “To expect that all women will vote the same way is naïve. But when women are in at least equal numbers in the Senate and their committees, the conversations will be different, the questions asked will be different, the ability to hear and not deflect will be there, the bullying tactics will be in check.”",The New York Times
2018,Resting Place,"daily crossword column Bruce Haight shows us his dark side. WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Happy Halloween to all who celebrate. Wordplay wishes you lots of good candy (I’ll trade you my Bit-O-Honeys for anything chocolate) and smooth solving. But first, this: Now that we’ve gotten that out of our systems, let’s turn our attention to the puzzle. Bruce Haight takes us on a tour of a spooky place that is sometimes associated with Halloween. You can practically hear the creaky doors moaning. Honestly, there was nothing here that wasn’t in my wheelhouse, either because I knew it or because the crossings were kind. I predict that solvers will spend more time thinking about the phonetic spelling than on the clues. Interesting looking grid, isn’t it? There’s that black square cross at the top, of course, and an enclosed space down at the bottom. Our job is to figure out what that is. Luckily, those shaded squares are there to give us a hint. It turns out that those three letter words that are shaded in five of the Down entries phonetically spell out the answer when read from left to right. For example, the first shaded entry at 28D, SEA SERPENT, represents the letter C. What comes next? Click on any of the clues to get more help. 5D. ""Do you still like me?"" ARE WE GOOD ARE = R 45D.

Serving at a 4:00 social TEA BISCUIT TEA = T Mr. Haight includes an additional revealer at 62A, clued as “Discovering the word at 67-Across, for this puzzle.” The answer there is THEME. And the mystery entry is solved: the grid contains a CRYPT. I remember sending a punny Halloween puzzle to The New York Times about a year ago. The editors replied that the puzzle was O.K., but they already had a Halloween puzzle in mind for 2018 — sorry, Charlie. That was disappointing, but then, a couple months later, they wrote to say this CRYPT puzzle was accepted for Halloween, and I had never even thought of that possibility. You just never know. (And the pun puzzle is running today in The L. A. Times.) I see the editors are teasing me about my crossword FILL again, at 12-Down, calling it “Truckload at a garbage dump.” On June 7, they rated my FILL “Dirt in a dump truck, perhaps,” so really not much improvement ... With regard to this crypt puzzle, I remember I was having a lot of trouble finding room for five theme entries and still being able to fill it cleanly. I eventually added a couple of blocks above WHY ME and it worked out. It wasn’t till I was cluing it that I noticed that I had accidentally made a cross directly above the crypt, which brought back memories of touring crypts below cathedrals in Europe. For Halloween, I guess it’s more like a tombstone marker over a crypt in the graveyard — at midnight, with spider webs. It’s useful to have a good word list and practice your construction a lot, but sometimes luck plays a huge role in puzzle production. My son Ryan was laid to rest in 2001, but he is remembered in a small way today, at 59-Down.

2018,Restoring the House the Ringling Circus Built,"Sarasota, Fla. — In the 1920s, John Ringling and his wife, Mable, built their dream house in Sarasota, Fla.: a 56-room Venetian Gothic palazzo named Ca’ d’Zan, or House of John. It was a showplace that they filled with treasures purchased around the world, including 400 objects from a mansion in Newport, R.I., that were sold when Alva Vanderbilt divorced William Vanderbilt. But when the Ringlings, whose wealth came from the circus named for John and his four brothers, died after falling into debt, the house and the associated art gallery were taken over by the State of Florida and became the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. Over time, the house fell into such disrepair that it served as Paradiso Perduto, the shambles of a castle that is Miss Havisham’s home in the 1998 film of “Great Expectations.” As a member of the museum’s staff, and later the curator of Ca’ d’Zan, Ron McCarty observed the decline with dismay. But Mr. McCarty, who retired this year, played a crucial role in not only restoring the house, but also in bringing back memorabilia from when the Ringlings lived there. His work underscores the challenges in maintaining historical properties. Having been closed for a decade, starting in 1936, Ca’ d’Zan had suffered from decay. Mold and mildew had grown on the walls, and the furniture fabrics had deteriorated. But in 1996, fueled with funds from the government, foundations and individuals, efforts began to restore the house to its original allure. Today, Ca’ d’Zan, along with Vizcaya in Miami and the Flagler Museum in Palm Beach, is one of Florida’s three great golden-age mansions open to the public. Mr. McCarty’s role gave him an unusual opportunity to delve deeply into family history. The Ringlings’ relatives, former business associates and employees could provide tales and objects. Over the decades, Mr. McCarty has remained fascinated by the family. John Ringling and his brothers made the circus the centerpiece of American entertainment, but at “the center of it all is the great love story of the Ringlings,” Mr. McCarty said in an interview shortly before he retired. Steven High, executive director of the Ringling, praised Mr. McCarty’s work. “During his frequent public presentations, his knowledge and passion has kept their spirit alive,” Mr. High said. For decades Mr. McCarty, part historian and part sleuth, pursued objects that told the Ringlings’ story. Daily, over 20 years, he said he logged on to eBay, where he found troves of photographs. He even found a 1927 issue of Country Life that described how the house looked when it first opened. If Mable Ringling’s closets were empty when Mr. McCarty took over, they are not now. Family members have given him over 50 pieces, from a hat box with Mable’s name on it to a black crepe beaded gown with sequins from French & Company that cost $1,800 in 1923. When Mrs. Ringling died, her clothes were dispersed among family members. “My sisters remember playing with them when they were little girls,” recalled Chris Schueler, the grandson of Mable’s sister Dulcy Burton. “The family had considered giving them back to the Ringling,” Mr. Schueler explained. “Then, about three years ago, we met Ron and fell in love with him.” Still, he said, “It was funny to see the curators using white gloves to handle all those things that my sisters had played with as children.” Sometimes discoveries were the result of going through the Ringlings’ bureaus. All their drawers had been locked since John Ringling’s death in 1936, probably because he kept them that way. By the 1990s, the keys had disappeared. “We got a locksmith to open the bureau, and we found all John Ringling’s Charvet ties lying in rows,” Mr. McCarty said. “It was spectacular,” he added, using a favorite term. Much of Ca’ D’Zan was the product of Mrs. Ringling’s passion for architecture and decoration. “The house was really her creation,” Mr. McCarty said. Both John and Mable came from large families and meager origins. But by their 1905 wedding, John Ringling was already rich enough to have commissioned a 79-foot Pullman train car. “That was like having your own private jet today,” Mr. McCarty explained. Visits to friends in Sarasota persuaded the Ringlings to buy a home on the bay. But it was not until 1924, after they had traveled extensively in Europe, that they began building Ca’ d’Zan. Italy was their shared infatuation. “The house was inspired by Ca’ d’Oro, the doge’s palace in Venice,” Mr. McCarty said. World-class shoppers who loved nothing so much as furniture that had once been owned by the elite, the Ringlings filled their home with objects from estate sales. For Mr. McCarty, who became the official curator in 2000, helping to restore the house’s glamour has been an exhilarating, if exhausting, labor of love. He had come to Ca’ d’Zan well trained for the work. “I grew up in Kansas City, and I wanted to be a painter,” he recalled. But lured by a steady salary from the Ringling, Mr. McCarty jumped when, in 1980, he was offered a job as a registrar of the historical records at the museum complex. Among his tasks was to serve as a courier for the museum’s works of art that were lent for exhibitions around the world. On one cargo trip from Japan to the United States, he recalled, “I was traveling with works of art on the same plane with racehorses, exotic snakes and very expensive racecars.” By the mid-1990s, Mr. McCarty had begun working on his gargantuan restoration project. One year was dedicated solely to the asbestos problem. Each object had to be moved out and cleaned. In many cases, Mr. McCarty said, the fabrics had to be replaced. For example, the original material on the four Louis XIV throne chairs was hand-loomed Genovese velvet. “It could have been duplicated by Scalamandre,” Mr. McCarty said. “But we would have had to wait two years, and the cost would have been $82,000 a chair.” Instead, Mr. McCarty tapped into an extensive network of experienced curators for a less expensive alternative. That was hardly the end of the work. Mr. McCarty had overseen the restoration of the gatehouse and the repair of damage from hurricanes. But despite the challenges, he said he enjoyed the job. “Every day was exciting because it was bringing the house back to life and filling it with objects the Ringlings actually had,” he said. “Even for historic houses, that is quite rare.”",The New York Times
2018,Retired Justice John Paul Stevens Says Kavanaugh Is Not Fit for Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — In an unusual rebuke from a former member of the Supreme Court, Justice John Paul Stevens said on Thursday that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was not qualified to sit on the court. Justice Stevens said he came to the conclusion reluctantly, changing his mind about Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination after the second round of the judge’s confirmation hearings last week. Judge Kavanaugh’s statements at those hearings, Justice Stevens said, revealed prejudices that would make it impossible for him to do the court’s work, a point he said had been made by prominent commentators. “They suggest that he has demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court that he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities,” Justice Stevens said in remarks to retirees in Boca Raton, Fla. “And I think there is merit in that criticism and that the senators should really pay attention to it.” “For the good of the court,” he said, “it’s not healthy to get a new justice that can only do a part-time job.” At the hearing last week, Judge Kavanaugh used starkly partisan language to describe the accusations against him. “This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,” he said, “fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.” Justice Stevens is 98, and he retired from the Supreme Court in 2010. He was appointed in 1975 by President Gerald R. Ford, a Republican, but he voted with the court’s liberal wing for much of his tenure. Justice Stevens said he had admired Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial work and had written positively about it in one of his books, “Six Amendments,” which proposed a number of changes to the Constitution. One concerned the Citizens United campaign finance case, in which Justice Stevens had dissented. In the book, Justice Stevens praised a decision from Judge Kavanaugh. Writing for a three-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Washington, Judge Kavanaugh ruled two foreign citizens living in the United States on temporary work visas could not spend money to call for the election of American politicians. Justice Stevens said he thought that decision was sound. “As a matter of fact, I put his picture in the book to illustrate my admiration for it,” Justice Stevens said. “At that time, I thought he had definitely the qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court and should be confirmed if he was ever selected.” [Struggling to keep up with the news on Judge Kavanaugh and the F.B.I. investigation? Catch up.] “I’ve changed my views for reasons that have really no relationship to his intellectual ability or his record as a federal judge,” Justice Stevens said. “He’s a fine federal judge, and he should have been confirmed when he was nominated.” “But I think that his performance during the hearings caused me to change my mind,” Justice Stevens said, noting that prominent law professors, including Laurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, were also critical of Judge Kavanaugh’s statements. Justice Stevens rejected comparisons to the experience of Justice Clarence Thomas, who endured a bruising confirmation hearing in 1991 after being accused of sexual harassment. “There’s nothing that Clarence did in the hearings that disqualified him from sitting in cases after he came on the court,” Justice Stevens said. Justice Stevens said he disagreed with Justice Thomas in most important cases but found him to be “a decent and likable person.” “You cannot help but like Clarence Thomas,” Justice Stevens said, “which I don’t think necessarily would be true of this particular nominee.”",The New York Times
2018,"Retired Police Officer Is Attacked and Wife, 71, Is Sexually Assaulted in Brooklyn Home Invasion","A 71-year-old woman was sexually assaulted and her husband, a retired police lieutenant, was attacked with a blade during a brutal home invasion in Brooklyn on Monday, the police said. The intruders remained at large Monday evening and their motive was unknown, the police said. The police were called about the attack, on Madison Place, near Marine Park, around 5:30 a.m., said Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department. Three men broke into the home and attacked the couple, she said. The woman was tied up and assaulted. The man, 72, who is retired from the Police Department, was injured after being struck in the head with a box cutter, the police said. The intruders stole a Honda Civic and fled the scene, the authorities said. The retired lieutenant’s firearm was also missing, the police said, and officers were investigating whether it was stolen as well. The couple, who have not been identified, were treated at a hospital. The woman was recovering at the hospital Monday night, the authorities said. The area around the couple’s house was taped off Monday evening, and police officers were going in and out of the house. “This is crazy,” said Lidia Bessmertnov, 48, who had to step under police tape while walking with her daughter on the tree-lined block of houses where the attack occurred. The neighborhood, where Ms. Bessmertnov has lived since 1993, is usually quiet, she said. She said it was “devastating” to know that such an attack had happened so close to where she lives with her children, and where they go to and from school. “This is really, really scary,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Retraining Workers for New Jobs and New Lives After Prison and Addiction,"JACKSBORO, Tenn. — Tony Simpson, an entrepreneurial engineer, had grown increasingly concerned about Campbell County, Tenn., where he grew up and still lived. Despite a reasonably solid manufacturing base, as well as scenic lakes and hills that attract tourists, the Appalachian region he calls home was beset by a depressed economy and high rates of incarceration, largely fueled by drug and alcohol addiction. Although he had a grueling travel schedule for his concrete restoration company, he began to volunteer as a jailhouse minister. “I started spending time, one on one, with the prisoners. And what I heard, over and over again, is that ‘when I get out of here, I’m never coming back.’ “But what I saw is that they’d cycle back in. They always had the same excuse — ‘I can’t get a job and the only place I have to live is the same place as I did before, which is full of drugs.’ “I did this for about three years, and, about two years ago, felt God calling, to address this. And I started thinking about a program of how to offer these men training and a job.” His calling led to the creation in 2016 of Better Made Trailers, a small company in Jacksboro, the county seat, that manufactures trailers for hauling. He started BMT, as it is known, “specifically to create jobs to work on this program.’’ A few months later, he heard that Bushtec, a local business that makes motorcycle trailers, was about to close. He approached the owners and purchased it. “That’s when I realized I had a big opportunity to get this program going.” A few weeks ago, nearly 1,000 people turned out for an outdoor community barbecue of hamburgers, hot dogs and all the trimmings to mark what they hoped would be a turning point in the region’s struggle because of efforts by Mr. Simpson and others. The county, near the Kentucky border, has often earned the designation of a “distressed” county — among the worst in the nation — according to a classification by the Appalachian Regional Commission largely based on census data. The common narrative tells a story of a region, long dependent on coal, that suffered economically when the demand dropped. That in turn, it is said, spurred a drug crisis among the jobless. But a more nuanced and more accurate view is that the decline in coal production and accompanying job loss coincided with something much more devastating: a spike in prescriptions for opioids, among other pain medications, as well as an increase in substance abuse generally. And that increase caused a drop in employment, according to Matthew Murray, a professor at the University of Tennessee who is studying the interaction of opioid use and the labor markets. “Opioid use has a large impact on both unemployment rates as well as employment participation rates,” both indicators of the health of a local economy. Indeed, Campbell County, with a population of approximately 40,000, has the third-highest per capita rate of opioid prescriptions in the nation. The amount prescribed, according to a federal Centers for Disease Control spokeswoman, “was enough for every individual in the county to be medicated around the clock for 15 weeks.’’ The overdose rate is also among the highest in the country. And the Campbell County unemployment rate in August was 5 percent; the national rate was 3.9 percent. While there are no definitive numbers, Andy Wallace, the deputy mayor for the county, estimates that over 95 percent of those jailed committed offenses that were in some way related to drug use. Mr. Simpson, without any formal training in rehabilitation and lacking even a prototype of a program, dove in. Initially, he hired a few men with felony charges, but “with managing a new business and doing the program, I realized I couldn’t do both. That’s when he brought in Stacy and Dave Bosch, who had run a bible camp but also were involved with “Celebrate Recovery,” a Christian-based program to help overcome addiction. Ms. Bosch had also worked at a local recovery home for women, but in an administrative position. Even with the Bosches on board to run “A New Beginning,” the name of the nonprofit Mr. Simpson formed, it was a lot tougher than he anticipated. Some would come in, “still jonesing,” Mr. Bosch said, meaning that they were still withdrawing from drug use. “We didn’t know how to sift through the applications and pretty much took anyone,” Ms. Bosch said, adding, that “now we ask how long they’ve been clean. The longer they’ve been off drugs, there’s more success, because they’ve done it for themselves, and not just for a job. Some finessed the drug testing the company did. “People knew how to play the game,” Mr. Simpson said. “We have a four-day workweek, so Thursday was party night” since retesting didn’t occur until the following week. Now the testing is done more frequently. They realized that a two-hour interview is insufficient and that, more important, many are unprepared to go from jail to work. Now, those accepted after extensive interviewing start a two-week life-skills course that includes classes on health, hygiene, cooking and renting, as well as car maintenance and computer skills. Religion isn’t a prerequisite and bible classes are optional. There’s a six-month training program to learn the skills for the job, like welding or painting, during which time participants are paid $10 an hour. (Once they graduate and are considered permanent employees, their salaries jump to $12 an hour, and they’re eligible for another raise three months later. The state’s minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, the federal rate.) With so many advances in manufacturing, including the automating of many tasks, Mr. Simpson considered buying a robotic welding tool that would ultimately save money and improve efficiencies. But, he said, “we made a choice not to automate” to keep those jobs for the men in the program. Since its inception in September 2017, 23 men have participated in the program. Of those, 10 have already graduated and three are getting ready to work, Ms. Bosch said. Jason Cox, who originally had been jailed for vandalism, and then served additional time for failing to pay his fines, was one of the first hired. “I had been out of jail for a month and a half. I was looking for work and getting a lot of nos.” But he heard about the program from a family friend, passed a two-hour intake, and was hired. He was assigned to the shipping area. Within a few months, the woman running the department left for another job and Mr. Cox was promoted. He brings another skill that he had undervalued: an affinity for computers that emerged only after Mr. Bosch casually asked about hobbies. That skill has been put to use frequently, said Keith Simpson, who is Tony Simpson’s first cousin and vice president of operations for BMT, as well as the president of a new division, Dyna Hauler. Shane Wyatt heard about the program from his cellmate, who had written to Ms. Bosch. He liked what she had to say. “If you’re not 100 percent in, there’s no sense in coming,” he recalled. Mr. Wyatt liked the tough-love approach, which he said, also included compassion. He now works for the company, pressure-washing and painting trailers. Others with a history of substance abuse have been hired outside of the program. Becky Goney, for example, a welder, had gone through a so-called recovery court and then trained at the the Tennessee College of Applied Technology here to learn how to weld. The recovery court, training and employment, she said, have kept her clean and enabled her to be with her three children again. That court was created roughly 11 years ago by Judge E. Shayne Sexton of Criminal Court who still administers the program, in addition to presiding over the criminal courts. He essentially wears two robes because of his dual roles, but he is committed to the program, which seeks to rehabilitate some accused of crimes while they’re young. “We believe that much of addiction — to both drugs and alcohol — comes from a lot of chaos,’’ Judge Sexton said. “We’re trying to eliminate that by showing how to live on one’s own, find housing and get employment. But until the Simpsons put together their program, we’ve always had a hard time finding employment” for those with a past. Many of the region’s programs to assist in rehabilitation are faith-based, an indication of the continued importance of churches in residents’ lives. Some, like Celebrate Recovery, are akin to Alcoholics Anonymous or its counterpart, Narcotics Anonymous. Those who have recovered through them attest to their help. Spirituality can help those trying to overcome addiction, said Kenneth E. Leonard, the director of the Research Institute on Addictions at the University at Buffalo, but you “can’t just pray these problems away” Judge Sexton said. Both Professor Leonard and Judge Sexton said that steady work is critically important. “We’ve known since the late 1960s that employment is a powerful predictor of low patterns of alcohol use and better responses to treatment. Similarly, some data suggests that when those addicted to opiates are stably employed and in a relationship with someone who doesn’t use drugs, the outcomes are better,” Professor Leonard said. He added that with opioids, 60 to 80 percent have relapsed to some extent within six months. But with regular drug testing, only one out of 23 of those hired have relapsed, Ms. Bosch said. Not everyone thought the program was a good idea at the beginning. Keith Simpson acknowledges that he was opposed initially. But he’s now a fan of the program —- so much so that he has co-signed a lease with one of the men in the program, since securing suitable housing is a problem for those with a felony past. To deal with that problem, they are building a 30-bed building for transitional housing. The one-acre site, across from the factory, has been graded and construction should begin soon, Mr. Simpson said. Campbell County has an active tourism business that accounts for $59 million a year in revenue, largely centered on boating on its lakes and off-roading in the surrounding mountains, according to Andy Wallace, the deputy mayor for the county. While that gives rise to jobs, the work is seasonal and often low-paying. The county also has a manufacturing economy. BSH Home Appliance Corp., has manufactured Thermador ranges and ovens at its plant in LaFollette for more than 20 years. Including a cooking technology center in Caryville, Tenn., the company employs more than 330 people, according to a spokesman, Joe Foster. Recently, another native, Rick Teague, in partnership with a German company, formed Telos Global, based in Caryville, which specializes in press-hardened steel and aluminum stampings used in the automotive industry. As a new company, its work force largely consists of engineers, but as he rolls out production, he hopes to follow Mr. Simpson’s lead and train and employ some coming out of jail. In September, Mr. Teague’s European account manager came to Campbell County to tour the local vocational school, the Tennessee College of Applied Technology, to determine if the school could train future employees. Mr. Simpson also has bigger plans for his company and his program. He and his cousin Keith Simpson recently acquired Dyna Hauler, which will produce equipment, known as the DynaDolly, used to transport shipping containers in lieu of a flatbed truck. With those containers increasingly being put to use for houses and offices, there’s a need to move them more easily, Mr. Simpson explained. To produce this new line, he is refurbishing an abandoned factory in Jellico, Tenn., perhaps the poorest municipality in the county. That factory, when up and running, will employ 100 people. Professor Murray said, they’re “trying to create their own work force, which is very noble. It is, however, a risky and costly endeavor.” So far, the risks have been manageable. The costs are significant: Tony Simpson says he has personally invested more than $500,000 to get the New Beginning program up and running. While Mr. Simpson has so far focused on men, he is planning a program to help women who have served time. Some, says Keith Simpson are skilled in the longstanding sewing traditions of Appalachia, and they hope to mobilize these women to work in the textile industry. The problem of substance abuse is widespread. But because of the glimmers of hope, Ms. Bosch suggested, somewhat offhandedly in a group call in August, that they have a municipal gathering to celebrate those in recovery. On Sept. 21, in LaFollette, the biggest town in the county, the crowd that had gathered for the free dinner, heard Christian-themed music and speeches acknowledging the challenges, as well as the success stories. Many shared their stories of addiction and rehabilitation. They lamented what many considered a “lost generation” and a large number of grandparents raising their grandchildren because of parents lost to substance abuse. Those involved say it’s a process. “We’re not just training to work here, but we want to change Campbell County. We want to see more qualified people so we’re attractive to people. We want them to know there’s a skilled work force,” Mr. Bosch said.",The New York Times
2018,"Rev. Thomas Keating, Pioneer in Contemplative Movement, Dies at 95","The Rev. Thomas Keating, a Trappist monk and a pioneer in the worldwide Christian contemplative prayer movement, died on Thursday at St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, Mass., where he had once been abbot. He was 95. His nephew Peter C. Jones confirmed the death and said Father Keating had been in declining health for several years. The arc of his life took Father Keating from riches to rags and back to riches again, Mr. Jones said in a telephone interview: He was born into affluence and privilege in Manhattan, walked away from it all when he entered an austere monastic community in Rhode Island, and was rewarded with spiritual riches. Father Keating played a major role in popularizing what is now known as centering prayer, a method of silent prayer that allows one to rest in the presence of God. Over the years, his thoughts crystallized into what friends said became one of his favorite sayings: “Silence is God’s first language. Everything else is a poor translation.” He was born Joseph Parker Kirlin Keating (and familiarly called Parker) on March 7, 1923, in Manhattan, one of four children of Cletus and Elizabeth (Kirlin) Keating. His father, like his father before him, was a prominent maritime lawyer. The family had a home in Manhattan and a summer estate in the exclusive Long Island community of Mill Neck. “At 5, I had a serious illness,” Father Keating recalled in a 2013 documentary made by Mr. Jones, “Thomas Keating: A Rising Tide of Silence.” “I heard adults in the next room wondering whether I’d live,” Father Keating said. “I took this very seriously, and at my first Mass bargained with God: ‘If you’ll let me live to 21, I’ll become a priest.’ “After that,” he continued, “I’d skip out early in the morning before school and go to Mass. I knew my parents wouldn’t approve, so I never told them.” While his mother read the Bible, his father was a lapsed Catholic. Parker Keating went to the Buckley School, a private school on the Upper East Side, and Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts before entering Yale. As he studied Christianity, he was drawn to the mystics and came to believe that the Scriptures call people into a personal relationship with God. Eager to explore his spirituality, he transferred from Yale to an accelerated program at the Jesuit-run Fordham University in the Bronx. He graduated in 1943. He expected to be drafted in World War II but received a deferment to enter the seminary. In 1944, at the age of 20, he entered the strict Cistercian Monastery Our Lady of the Valley in Valley Falls, R.I. He was ordained a priest in 1949. He chose the name Thomas as his spiritual name because of his admiration for St. Thomas Aquinas, according to his brother, Marshall. The monastic life appealed to him, but it forced him to cut ties with his family, which caused many of them considerable pain, as he recounted in the documentary. His grandmother, he recalled, wrote him from her sickbed: “I miss you so much. I’m lying here in bed, and I said to the nurse, ‘If my grandson doesn’t come home, won’t you please just throw me out the window?’ ” But all he could do was pray for her, he said. “I felt the more austere the life, the sooner I would achieve the contemplative life I sought,” he continued. “I spent the next five to six years observing almost total silence.” Mr. Jones said that for many years he had thought of Father Keating as “my mystery uncle, whom I knew about but never saw.” But as time went on, Father Keating would visit family in New York. And when Mr. Jones’s father died, Father Keating held a funeral Mass in their living room. “My father had landed on Omaha Beach, and my uncle called it a ‘tragedy,’ ” Mr. Jones said. “He viewed World War II not as a great victory but as a tragedy for humanity.” In 1950, while Father Keating was in Rhode Island, the monastery burned down and the monks moved to St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, in central Massachusetts. He left Spencer in 1958 to help start a new monastic community, St. Benedict’s, in Snowmass, Colo., not far from Aspen. In 1961 he was elected abbot at St. Joseph’s and returned to Massachusetts, where he served in that capacity for the next two decades. In 1971, after the Second Vatican Council, at which Pope Paul VI encouraged priests and religious scholars to renew the Christian contemplative tradition, Father Keating was invited to Rome. This led him, along with William Meninger and Basil Pennington, to develop the practice of centering prayer. But his enthusiasm for this approach led to tensions within the abbey, and a vote on whether he should remain as abbot was evenly split. He decided he did not want to remain in a house so divided and moved back to Snowmass. It was a liberating move for him. He began organizing conferences with representatives of other religions, including the Dalai Lama, imams and rabbis. During this period he focused more on centering prayer, holding workshops and retreats to promote it to clergy and lay people. He helped found Contemplative Outreach, a network of people who practice centering prayer, in 1984 and was its president from 1985 to 1999. “Centering prayer is all about heartfulness, which is a little different from mindfulness,” the Rev. Carl Arico, a co-founder of Contemplative Outreach, said in a telephone interview. “It goes to the relationship with God, who is already there. It’s not sitting in a void.” Today, Contemplative Outreach has chapters in 39 countries, with about 40,000 people who actively participate and many more who practice centering prayer on their own. Father Keating wrote more than 30 books and created various multimedia projects; one of his most popular is “Centering Prayer: A Training Course for Opening to the Presence of God,” which consists of a workbook, DVDs and audio CDs. One reviewer called it “a monastery in a box.” In addition to his nephew and his brother, Father Keating is survived by six other nieces and nephews. Another brother, Cletus Keating Jr., and a sister, Anne Keating Jones, died before him.",The New York Times
2018,Reverent Beauty: The Met’s Armenia Show Is One for the Ages,"Critic’s Pick The Metropolitan Museum of Art gives the blockbuster treatment to Armenia, the oldest Christian country in the world. They were mostly young people who came out in the streets of Armenia this past spring, waving balloons of red, orange and blue. They were fed up with their ineffectual government, and on their smartphones they watched the progress of an opposition leader, the former journalist Nikol Pashinyan, as he walked in protest across central Armenia. When he arrived in Yerevan, the capital of this former Soviet republic, the crowds sang, shouted and swore to go on strike. Less than six weeks later, Mr. Pashinyan was named interim prime minister of Armenia, ushered into office on the shoulders of the extraordinary, nonviolent “velvet revolution.” Armenia is a country with so much history it can overwhelm you. This spring we learned its future might be as eventful as its past, which makes it a timely moment for “Armenia!,” the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s eye-opening appraisal of the art, manuscripts, textiles and religious artifacts of a nation that is still adding surprising chapters to its dramatic history. Mr. Pashinyan attended the opening last month. There was no sign, alas, of Kim Kardashian, our most famous Armenian-American, but His Holiness Karekin II, the catholicos (or supreme patriarch) of the Armenian church, was also spotted in the galleries; the country was the first to make Christianity its official religion, and this exhibition, packed with weighty stone crosses and richly illuminated gospels, is a testament to the centrality of the church to Armenian cultural identity. No museum has ever mounted such a large exhibition of Armenian art, and most of the 140 objects here come from museum collections and churches in Armenia and rarely travel. “Armenia!” has been organized by Helen C. Evans, the Met’s curator of Byzantine art, and focuses specifically on the art and history of the country’s medieval period. It is not, despite the exclamation point in its title, an exhibition that favors razzle-dazzle. In fact, “Armenia!” is a rather bookish sort of blockbuster, concentrating heavily on illuminated manuscripts, and presented in low lighting to protect the gospels and romances on view. There is some ecclesiastical flash, in the form of bejeweled crucifixes and gold-plated censers, but this is primarily an exhibition of book illustration, unlike any other medieval manuscript show you’re likely to see. Armenia had a long middle age, extending from the early fourth century, when St. Gregory the Illuminator converted the king, Tiridates III, to Christianity — an event commemorated at the opening of this show by a stela of porous stone, carved with portraits of the two men — until the late 16th century, when printed books made their first appearance. This mountainous region was a crossroads of influences from east and west, but Armenian art scrambles simple understandings of “Europe” and “Asia,” exhibiting a stylistic cosmopolitanism even as it used Christian identity to define itself within the world of Islam. Armenian book artists were not anonymous; they signed their names, had their own styles, and took risks. One volume here, flamboyantly illuminated by Sargis Pidzak in 1331, is open to a picture of a priest praying before St. Matthew in a field of gold leaf, while initial letters of the Gospels dance with the angels. (Note the pointy black hood worn by the kneeling priest: this distinctly Armenian clerical garb is still worn today.) A Bible from the later medieval period, illuminated by an artist named Hakob, depicts God as a ruddy-faced, goggle-eyed young man, as if in awe at his own creation. In a 16th-century manuscript relating the life of Alexander the Great, done in Rome by an Armenian bishop called Zak‘ariay of Gnunik‘, the Macedonian king’s ship is swallowed by an enormous brown crab, hooking the sails with its pincers as its mouth gapes open. The Bibles and ritual books here are testament to a relatively literate medieval society, one with its own Christian identity, and one that used (and still uses) its own involute alphabet, developed in 405 by the cleric and scholar now known as St. Mesrop Mashtots‘. This new alphabet, with its arcing capital letters, was the key to the conversion of Armenian society into a Christian society, since religious services could now be conducted in the vernacular. A densely lettered, unspaced sheet of parchment here, whose translation of the Book of Corinthians could date from as early as the fifth century, is one of more than a dozen objects on loan to the Met from the Matenadaran Mesrop Mashtots‘ Institute. There’s more than manuscripts. Beautifully woven vestments and altar frontals affirm that Armenian believers saw as much beauty in services as in the scriptoria. Reliquaries in the form of St. Gregory’s right arm were popular, and one silver, gem-studded specimen here is said to contain the remains of his last known male descendant. Gold earrings with dangling pendants shaped like crescent moons and birds, dating to the 11th century, are a rare example of secular material here, and their filigreed panels reflect the influence of neighboring Iran. Perhaps the most distinctive artworks of the Armenian Middle Ages are the khachkars, or cross-stones, found across the Southern Caucasus. These slabs of tuff, basalt or dolomite are carved with highly decorative crosses, and their elaborate patterns suggest the influence of Islamic culture even as they attest to an unshakable Christian faith. Medieval Armenia was not a centralized polity, and frequent foreign incursions — from the seventh century, when overlords practicing the new religion of Islam invaded greater Armenia; to the 13th century, when Mongol warriors raided the east of Anatolia; to the invasions of the Ottomans and Safavids in the later medieval era — were a constant threat. What kept it all together was their own autocephalous church, not answerable to Rome or Constantinople. Rival kings and rich merchant families competed to deck out the most lavish cathedrals, and in the later medieval period scriptoria popped up in monasteries across greater Armenia, down into Crimea, and even as far as Italy, the source of several manuscripts here. By the end of the 17th century, when Armenian power had flourished along new trade routes, an Italian aristocrat living in Constantinople received a gift: a panoramic map of the world of Armenian influence. Known as the Tabula Chorographica Armenica, this 12-foot painted map includes nearly 800 sites of Armenian Christian worship, stretching past the Caucasus to Jerusalem and Iran. In one corner the bearded St. Gregory destroys idols in an Ottoman town, while laymen and clergy, painted in a style more Persian than European (softer features, finer lines), chat amiably outside Etchmiadzin Cathedral, the Armenian equivalent of the Vatican. The peaks of Mount Ararat, the landing place, according to the Bible, of Noah’s ark, are breasts of solid green. This boggling showstopper of a map was not meant for navigation, and the elite merchants who gazed on it would have appreciated its expression of the depth of Armenian trade routes in the new early modern age. To modern eyes at the Met, it has other overtones: its breadth recalls the extent of the contemporary Armenian diaspora, and its numerous churches in Ottoman territory portend the genocide to come during World War I. Armenians, as this great show attests, have long been at the mercy of outside forces, and the beauty of this show is tinged with conquest and subjection. But the young revolutionaries who marched and sang in Yerevan this spring — such a rare gleam of hope in this global age of authoritarianism — knew that the manuscript of Armenian history is still being written.

2018,Review: A Captive Emily Dickinson in ‘Because I Could Not Stop’,"The great American poet is as restless as a cheetah in a cage. She paces in frenzied circles, collapses onto the floor in brooding meditation and folds piece after piece of small paper with fretful, concentrated industry. Sometimes she glares at the audience watching her, as if through invisible bars. “I’m nobody,” she snarls. “Who are you?” Those are the first words spoken by the title character of “Because I Could Not Stop: An Encounter With Emily Dickinson,” a new production from the Ensemble for the Romantic Century, starring Angelica Page. Presumably you’ve heard them before, first read to you by a parent, perhaps, or an English teacher. More recently, Cynthia Nixon cooed them lovingly to an infant — not during her campaign for governor, but in the 2017 Terence Davies film about Dickinson, “A Quiet Passion.” But that deathless declaration of anonymity has probably never been uttered with the resentful ferocity that Ms. Page brings to it, in this fuzzy multimedia production at the Pershing Square Signature Center. The once popular image of Dickinson as a self-effacing, self-sacrificing recluse has been shelved in recent years. Evidence of the Massachusetts writer’s more combative, proto-feminist streak was emphasized not only in Mr. Davies’s excellent movie but also in a 2017 exhibition titled (here we go again) “I’m Nobody! Who Are You? The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson” at the Morgan Library & Museum. Ms. Page’s Emily, though, may be the most flamboyantly unhappy version to date. An intense and gifted performer known for her stage portrayals of her mother, the fabled actress Geraldine Page, and another celebrated poet, Sylvia Plath, Ms. Page here conjures an anguished Emily in captivity, whose brittle acerbity and magnificent moroseness are rather in the mode of Dorothy Parker, minus the cigarettes and martinis. The context for this characterization is both copious and inadequate in “Because I Could Not Stop,” written by James Melo and directed by Donald T. Sanders. Like most offerings from the Ensemble for the Romantic Century, this one is multidisciplinary, blending words with music and elaborate visuals. It’s an approach that worked beautifully in the company’s “Van Gogh’s Ear” last year. Here the various elements seldom reflect on one another in mutually illuminating ways. Vanessa James’s set suggests a hybrid of Deco luxury (clear mantelpieces with crystalline swans inside) and New England homeyness (the little desk at which Emily writes), with what look like outsized handwritten poems embedded in the floor. Clearly, we are in the abstract realm where artists cogitate and compose. Stylized renderings (by David Bengali) of slowly opening flowers, swaying grass and birds on the wing are projected onto a screen, along with timeline factoids about Dickinson’s family and the era in which she lived. A quintet of musicians and the soprano Kristina Bachrach perform (beautifully) music by Amy Beach, a 19th-century American composer to whose work I am glad to have been introduced. Yet I had trouble linking its soaring romantic strains with the hymnbook metrics and crisply chosen words of Dickinson’s poetry. Ms. Page’s Emily recites from some of these poems, as well as providing Dickinson’s recipe for black cake. She watches, excluded and contemplative, as the other performers play flirtatious, courtship-minded games of musical chairs and blind man’s bluff, and sobs into a handkerchief looking at projections of casualty statistics from the Civil War. She is also an Emily who very much minds being invisible. “I wonder how success would taste, just a drop,” she says ravenously. The haunting sense of mortality and eternity in Dickinson’s work often takes a back seat here to more worldly concerns. And despite the extensive visuals of flora and fauna, this Emily never seems to revel in nature’s bounty. “If God had been here and seen the things that I have seen — I guess he would think his own paradise superfluous,” she says toward the end. Yet the impression given by this disconnected pageant is that Dickinson’s life on earth was far closer to hell. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: A New Conductor Inspires the Orchestra of St. Luke’s,"Connoisseurs love to talk about the distinct sounds of different orchestras. But there’s art in versatility, too — in the ability of a group of players to adapt, chameleon-like, to the demands of the given music and conductor. The Orchestra of St. Luke’s is such an ensemble. On Thursday at Carnegie Hall, the group gave a beautifully light-footed and expressively shaded performance of works by Haydn and Mozart under the direction of Bernard Labadie, its new principal conductor. Just three weeks earlier, on the same stage, this orchestra had accompanied the star tenor Jonas Kaufmann in an evening of operetta arias. On that occasion it showed off a chocolaty tone and the deliciously indulgent phrasing Austrians might label “mit Schlag” (with whipped cream on top). On Thursday, in Haydn’s restless “Nelson Mass” and Mozart’s brooding Requiem, the players produced a leaner, more airy sound. With its swift pacing and nervy fluctuations in warmth, their playing had all the best qualities of period-instrument performance — responsive to the music’s emotional eddies without ever breaking the flow. Mr. Labadie is a specialist in music of the Baroque and Classical era. In Quebec he founded two ensembles, Les Violons du Roy and the chamber choir La Chapelle de Québec, that have become first-rate proponents of historically-informed performance practice, known widely as HIP. But it’s not always easy to transfer that knowledge: In 2013 I was underwhelmed by Mr. Labadie’s efforts to HIP-up the New York Philharmonic’s Bach. By contrast, the Orchestra of St. Luke’s includes players — including its concertmaster, Krista Bennion Feeney — who are well versed in the period-instrument world. With Mr. Labadie at its helm, the ensemble looks set to develop a distinct profile on the New York scene. I certainly can’t remember hearing a better rendition of the opening bars of Mozart’s Requiem, with claustrophobic string figures under a yearning wind chorale — floating, evenly weighted, as on an updraft of air. It took the quartet of soloists a while to achieve similar balance. The soprano Lauren Snouffer sounded overpowered in the dramatic beginning of Haydn’s mass, her fine-grained, chiseled singing more at home in gentler moments. In ensemble numbers, the vibrant plush tone of the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham could also outmuscle Ms. Snouffer, and the strident singing of the tenor Lothar Odinius sat oddly alongside the sober elegance of Philippe Sly’s bass-baritone. Many of the most arresting stretches of the concert were those involving the excellent Chapelle de Québec choir. But the soloists found common purpose in Haydn’s “Et incarnatus.” On the words “sepultus est” — “was buried” — Mr. Labadie created an exquisitely transparent texture, with the soloists’ voices finely combined and just a tiny extra weight in the choir’s basses adding an eerie note of mystery.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: A Pianist’s Profound Vision of ‘Life,’ in Just 2 Hours","An Igor Levit recital is never an easy outing, for him or the audience. In one marathon concert, he played titanic works by Bach, Schubert, Beethoven and Prokofiev. When he last appeared at Zankel Hall, the subterranean chamber space at Carnegie Hall, he followed an hour of music by Shostakovich and Frederic Rzewski with, nonchalantly, the hourlong “Diabelli” Variations. The 31-year-old pianist’s return to Zankel on Friday was a little shorter by comparison — just two hours, including an intermission — but larger in scope and reaching cosmic profundity. I suppose we should have expected as much from a program inspired by Mr. Levit’s latest album, titled simply yet formidably, “Life.” That recording, which cements Mr. Levit’s status as one of the essential artists of our time, is an expansive exploration of life itself, and a reaction to the death of his best friend, the artist Hannes Malte Mahler, who was killed in a bike accident in 2016. But “Life” is far from an elegy; it’s by turns mournful, searching and celebratory, even transcendent. On Friday, Mr. Levit played much of the album’s weighty program, including works and transcriptions by Brahms, Busoni, Liszt and Schumann. (The encore, Mr. Rzewski’s “A Mensch,” also came from “Life.”) I’ve been walking around with these pieces in my headphones for weeks, but in person they were newly poignant and more extreme than ever: meditative quiet or cathartic outcry, with virtually nothing in between. The differences between recording and live performance weren’t so stark at the beginning, in Brahms’s consistently mighty transcription of Bach’s famous Chaconne, a minimal version of the work as exposed as the original for solo violin. (Not that Mr. Levit, who plays with commanding precision and a preternaturally clear lower register, would need to hide.) But in the second work, Busoni’s “Fantasia Nach J.S. Bach,” Mr. Levit achieved such hushed tranquillity, the sound of breathing around me was dangerously loud by comparison. Listening through headphones, especially on the go around a city, it’s tempting in moments like this to adjust the volume as needed, which exacerbates a flattening effect already inherent in recordings. In person, Busoni’s music had the ability to reach its holy potential. And Mr. Levit sensitively carried the piece’s calm ending, without a pause, into the lyrical opening of Schumann’s “Ghost” Variations. Remarkably, he also took no pause between Liszt’s transcription of the Solemn March to the Holy Grail from “Parsifal” and that composer’s Fantasia and Fugue on “Ad Nos, ad Aalutarem Undam” (originally for organ, and transcribed for piano by Busoni.) Together, those two works run longer than 40 minutes; both are back-breakingly difficult, for different reasons. The brief “Parsifal” transcription is a slow burn that requires extreme patience. Mr. Levit played the church-bell-like bass line with an unwavering rubato that led gradually to the grandeur of a vast cathedral. The lengthy “Ad nos,” however, is all but symphonic, with dizzyingly virtuosic passages that provide blurry-handed thrills and placid interludes that Mr. Levit relished. It was during those serene moments that his playing was at its most inward, almost (but not quite) to a fault. Would this approach to performance have the power to carry a concerto? We in New York wouldn’t know. While Mr. Levit continues to reach new heights with each recital, he has yet to make his orchestral debut here. That will change next March, when he is scheduled to play Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto with the Vienna Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall. It’s about time he moved upstairs to the big auditorium.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Put-Upon Nanny Erupts in Todd Solondz’s ‘Emma and Max’,"Watching scenery being changed is not, as a general rule, what you go to the theater for. But this basic necessity of stagecraft takes on such emotional weight in “Emma and Max,” written and directed by the filmmaker Todd Solondz in his theatrical debut, that it becomes the production’s most moving element, in far more than a literal sense. That’s because the person who has been assigned the strenuous tasks of repositioning walls and furniture for this strident satire, which opened on Sunday at the Flea Theater, is not a stagehand but a character in the play. Her name is Brittany, and she performs her transformative duties with plodding exertion and a closed face. You figure that by the end Brittany, played by a compellingly centered Zonya Love, will either have collapsed with exhaustion or exploded in the kind of eruption that claims serious casualties. Since this a work by Mr. Solondz, whose willfully disturbing movies include “Happiness” and “Wiener-Dog,” you probably know which result to bet on. Brittany, an illegal immigrant from Barbados, works as an au pair to a rich, self-centered Manhattan businessman, Jay (Matt Servitto), and his even more narcissistic wife, Brooke (Ilana Becker). The play’s title characters are the couple’s young children, who though seen only fleetingly in video, exert a commanding gravitational pull. Taking care of little Emma and Max is only part of Brittany’s duties to make the world a more livable place for her employers. Hence, Mr. Solondz’s inspired notion of having her open the panels of Julia Noulin-Merat’s ingenious set and set up the comfortable environments — be they bedroom, swimming pool, hotel suite or airplane (business class) — in which Jay and Brooke can complain about being uncomfortable. They do so with no acknowledgment that someone else has turned down the sheets or turned on the bedside lamp. Though Brittany, whom they fire as their nanny in the play’s first scene, is frequently a topic of conversation for them, they seem no more aware of her efforts on their behalf than if she were a beast of burden. Or, to use an even more repellent term, a slave. Mr. Solondz’s extracurricular use of his leading actress offers bright hope for his prospects as a man of the theater. Watching Ms. Love pulling heavy platforms and toting airplane seats creates a visceral, uneasy empathy in the audience that could never be achieved on film. Twinging at the back of our minds is the feeling that Brittany is laboring so unhappily on our behalf, too. In physical terms, Mr. Solondz has translated his cinematic-eye view into a specifically theatrical vision with admirable success. There’s not a misstep in the staging, from the queasy-making projections of swirling water (by Adam J. Thompson) to the uncompromising and unflattering lighting (by Becky Heisler McCarthy). “Emma and Max” is always fascinating to look at, even if it’s in a masochistic way. Listening to what it has to say is another matter. From his breakout movie, “Welcome to the Dollhouse” (1996), Mr. Solondz has been a sharp-eyed, cross-eyed portraitist of the festering nastiness within picket-fence suburbia, offering boundary-pushing variations on the domestic hells once summoned by fiction writers like John Cheever and Richard Yates. What he provided in his best films, though, was unexpected compassion for the very souls he excoriated. (Think of Dylan Baker’s harrowing incarnation of the pedophile next door in “Happiness.”) His American archetypes may often have been vicious, burnt-out cases, but he also asked us to acknowledge the pain that crippled them. There are flashes of such insight in “Emma and Max.” But from the moment we meet the whiny, needy, terminally solipsistic Brooke and Jay, it’s clear that they’re fish in a barrel — make that big, frozen fish in a small barrel — just waiting to be speared and gutted. In their opening scene, in which they tell Brittany they’re letting her go, they are obviously so far up their own narcissism that the outside world is little more than their mirror. Firing Brittany becomes all about them — their guilt, their anxieties, their comfort. When the scene ends with Brittany’s having a seizure, Brooke and Jay look on in distressed passivity. They are also a garrulous couple, given to long spiels of self-justification and self-laceration. In a monologue delivered poolside at a fancy resort, the impeccably manicured and accoutered Brooke equates being the victim of racism with her own experience as an “ugly” girl. “It was like my own personal Kristallnacht — only it went on for years!” she says. She adds: “I wish I’d been born black. Then I could’ve shared the pain, the injustice of it all.” Though initially more taciturn, Jay soon becomes his wife’s equal in anxious soliloquizing. In an insomniac’s rant, delivered to a spectral Brittany, he gives a speech about the art of firing people (and, yes, the audience seemed to pick up on suggested parallels to America’s reigning chief executive) that is rife with slips into reflexive racism. Mr. Servitto (of “The Sopranos”) and Ms. Becker perform with an impressive lack of distancing irony. But given their lines, it’s impossible for them not to register as grotesquely obtuse variations on the limousine-liberal guilt junkies from the slyer, fuller plays of Wallace Shawn. (Rita Wolf’s Padma, a conscientiously caring academic who interviews Brittany, is cut from the same coarse cloth.) Brittany has the advantage of keeping her mouth closed for much of the play. When she opens it in her own aria of self-explanation, in the final scene, she is revealed to be a person of all-consuming hatred, relieved by sad, piquant fantasies borrowed from the film of “Mamma Mia!” Ms. Love delivers this speech with virtuoso variations of shading and tempo. But it’s hard not to feel that she’s only making explicit what you’ve intuited before. It’s not the late gruesome plot twist or broadside attacks on the rich and uncaring that sting and linger in “Emma and Max.” It’s the image of Ms. Love’s Brittany, grim and obdurate and weary, as she wordlessly sets up scene after scene for our dubious entertainment.

2018,Review: A Restless Spirit Haunts a Family in ‘A Season in France’,"A plaintive spirit hovers over “A Season in France,” the latest feature by Mahamat-Saleh Haroun (“A Screaming Man”), about a refugee family from the Central African Republic living in Paris. The film opens on a forested area with distant gunshots. This gloomy image is punctuated by a woman’s heart-wrenching cry that startles Abbas (Eriq Ebouaney) awake. Then, a statuesque woman with a beautiful Afro appears in the hallway, a smile on her face; she disappears as Abbas moves toward her. It’s possible she is a ghost, or a figment of his imagination. His young daughter, Asma (Aalayna Lys), is also roused from sleep, and tells of having dreamed of her deceased mother. “I miss her, too,” Abbas assures Asma. He comforts her with her mother’s lullaby, but a third disembodied voice — a woman’s — joins in. They look as though they can hear this woman, Abbas’s eyes searching for the source, to no avail. The instance is touching and chilling, like much of “A Season in France.” Haroun lives in these quiet, understated moments throughout, be it a tense scene between lovers who have drifted apart or a cheerful birthday dinner celebration. And while the story plays a bit with the notion of the supernatural, the spirit foregrounded here is more tangible: an ominous sense of restlessness and curtailed dreams. Back home, Abbas was a high school French teacher; now in Paris, anxiously awaiting political asylum, he works at a food market. Asma and her brother, Yacine (Ibrahim Burama Darboe), have difficulty adjusting, as the family is forced to move frequently. Étienne (Bibi Tanga), Abbas’s brother, struggles with feelings of inadequacy, having gone from being a philosophy professor to a pharmacy security guard. Thankfully there are episodes of reprieve, like an impromptu pillow fight between Abbas and his children. And there is Abbas’s romantic partner, Carole (Sandrine Bonnaire), a warm Frenchwoman whom the children adore. Her love for Abbas is unfailing, yet his uncertain future and the lingering pain from the loss of his wife prevent him from being able to fully commit to Carole emotionally. As Abbas, Ebouaney anchors this delicate balancing act between optimism and dread, embodying vulnerability while trying to remain hopeful and authoritative in front of Asma and Yacine. The children, for their part, occasionally launch bitter admonishments at their father: “You said you knew people in France who would welcome us,” Yacine complains. “You lied to us,” adds Asma, in that blunt, uninhibited way children speak when hurting. The film builds toward an explicit condemnation of Europe’s handling of the refugee crisis, encouraging the viewer’s fury at the family’s forced circumstances. But it doesn’t need this. Haroun has already so carefully demonstrated, through wordless scenes and intimate world building, a heartbreaking sadness that haunts long after the movie ends.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Russian Gymnast Goes ‘Over the Limit’,"Gorgeous and graceful, the Russian rhythmic gymnast Margarita Mamun glides across the floor, twirling a hoop or a streaming red ribbon around her fantastically limber body. Her contortions are mesmerizing, and for a moment we relax in expectation that “Over the Limit” will be a rather soothing sports documentary. Minutes later, however, we realize that what we are watching is a real-life horror movie. “Why do we need her? She’s not a fighter!” The harsh voice, swollen with disgust, belongs to the head of the Russian team, Irina Viner-Usmanova, a perfect villain in thick makeup and scary hats. Mamun, anxiously training for the 2016 Olympics while coping with a foot injury and her father’s cancer diagnosis, is pale and silent. Yet the verbal abuse continues, relentless and sometimes vicious, a harrowing psychological barrage that fills the movie and batters the ears. Reports of excessively punitive training of female gymnasts surface with some regularity, so in that sense “Over the Limit” is not unexpected. But the Polish director Marta Prus, brilliantly constructing a very particular look at a sport in which the arch of an eyebrow is as important as that of a spine, remains coolly impassive. Rather than shape an angry exposé, Prus, herself a former gymnast, recognizes and embraces the Cinderella-like appeal of Mamun’s punishing journey. By the end of the movie’s brief 74 minutes, this resilient young woman seems shockingly untraumatized; the audience might not be so lucky.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Song of Eternity in ‘Midnight at the Never Get’,"Critic’s Pick In the glamorous little corner of the afterlife that Trevor Copeland built, heaven is a nightclub stage. Bathed in hazy purple light, it has a piano at the ready and a five-piece band to back it, because what kind of paradise doesn’t include a horn section? Trevor is a singer, and in the wistful “Midnight at the Never Get” — the lushly romantic if clunkily titled new musical by Mark Sonnenblick, directed by Max Friedman at the York Theater Company at St. Peter’s — he has been here a long while, polishing his act. This is the way he chooses to spend eternity: inside a cabaret show made up of songs that he and the love of his life, Arthur Brightman, performed back in the 1960s at a Greenwich Village gay bar called the Never Get. Such are the perks of being dead. “You get to pick a memory,” Trevor tells us. “Make a little house out of it. Hang the walls and rough the floors with all the detail you have left. And then you stay, as long as you like, in your infinite moment, where you can be just like you were.” Or, more to the point, the way you wish you’d been. Played by Sam Bolen, who conceived this small treasure of a show with Mr. Sonnenblick, Trevor is an irresistible charmer — a tenderhearted, irrepressible imp with a puppyish winsomeness. Arthur is less extroverted, more suave, but they have a flirtatious chemistry from the moment they meet, in 1963. Soon Arthur, an ambitious composer at the start of his career, is writing love songs for Trevor to perform, and stubbornly refusing to change the lyrics so they’ll pass as straight. But he’s also turning out American Songbook-style tunes in a folk-rock age. He is in some ways deeply traditional. As the gay-rights movement takes shape around them, Arthur vehemently wants nothing to do with protests. His defiance is in his art, performed at a gay club at a time when those were illegal — and also in his life, as a gay man in love with another man, which could get them arrested or worse. But the guy we see at the piano, re-enacting their relationship with Trevor, is not actually Arthur. He is The Pianist (Jeremy Cohen), Trevor’s bright, bruised remembrance of the man he cherished the most. The handsome show that Trevor has been prepping (choreography by Andrew Palermo, costumes by Vanessa Leuck, lighting by Jamie Roderick, set by the ingenious brothers Christopher and Justin Swader) is for Arthur to step into, once he arrives. If he arrives. Mr. Sonnenblick’s music, beautifully orchestrated by Adam Podd, strikes that elusive balance between fresh and period-familiar, and the lyrics are lively. There’s only one jarring anachronism, a reference to the emergency number 911, that can’t quite be explained away. Otherwise this smartly constructed show is utterly transporting — and, for all its romance, frank about the bigotry and shame that gay men faced in that era. An intimate, aching chamber musical about heartbreak and bliss, “Midnight at the Never Get” is about bravery, too. And about the kind of battered hope that refuses to die, even after death.

2018,Review: A Sublime New Direction for Andrew Norman in Los Angeles,"LOS ANGELES — Until now, it has been possible to talk about “the Andrew Norman style” as though that were some settled thing. Several of this young composer’s major pieces — bearing active titles like “Play,” “Try” and “Switch” — have hurtled, from their opening minutes, with volleys of intensity that rival the kinetic climaxes of other artists. And then, with that established, he can really go to town. Given this creative profile, the title of Mr. Norman’s latest orchestral work, “Sustain,” hinted at an intriguing about-face. Steadiness and stasis have not been his calling cards. And in a recent interview with Joshua Barone of The New York Times, Mr. Norman described a desire to “relearn my language” when fulfilling this Los Angeles Philharmonic co-commission. That was not idle talk. Saturday night’s performance by the Philharmonic and its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, here at their Walt Disney Concert Hall home underlined just how willingly Mr. Norman has inverted his established practices. Instead of quickly fostering a riot of competing rhythms and motifs, this composition deals in repetitive material for long stretches over its approximately 45-minute length. Percussive interjections and unpredictable collisions of melody are the exception, rather than the rule. During the opening minutes, the composer asks individual strings to play select tones from attractively mystic modes — and then hold each one for a spell. (This “sustain” is one aspect of the title.) The staggered approach made the steady ascents and descents through the pitches seem less like composer-directed themes and more like seesawing laws of nature, perfectly in balance. Initially, the effect was sublime, in addition to being a compelling realization of the ecological concerns the composer detailed in his program note. (Ideas regarding environmental sustainability — and its all-too-probable opposite — give the title additional weight.) Still, during the first third of “Sustain,” the lack of much rhythmic thrust occasionally threatened to make the work seem aimless. At one point, I noticed myself breathing a sigh of relief when an exciting new dance for flute and vibraphone rose up from the well-trod ground. (It was the first time I’d ever been anxious for the next change when listening to Mr. Norman’s music.) Yet gradually, I came to love the consequences of this pacing. Whereas many of his past works have been all about focusing on each new improbable element as it stomps to the fore, here, Mr. Norman’s complexity has a lighter footprint. As the strings are painting with those long tones, a smaller group of wind instruments might divebomb through the frame, without causing a commotion. Minimalist motors can possess the trumpets, for a few moments, without scrambling the overall narrative. Over the final third of “Sustain,” this unusual merger between restraint and hyperactivity could hypnotize. When reading that the score calls for two pianos, tuned a quarter-tone apart, you might reasonably expect some microtonal fireworks. But the dissonances between the pianos are only ever highlighted gently, at hinge points when both are clearly audible. At other junctures, the pianos seemed content to let their collective resonance slip mysteriously into the background. Even when the dynamic level increases to an undeniable roar, there is a smoothness to the piece. Bringing all this across requires an orchestra of considerable dexterity (and patience). The Los Angeles players seemed to savor the material, even when it did not seem obviously virtuosic in nature. Mr. Dudamel succeeded in channeling the slyness of Mr. Norman’s writing, too. Taking the transitions in too showy a manner might prove deadly to its overall designs; wisely, Mr. Dudamel built to the passages of pandemonium with a gratifying steeliness of purpose. Perhaps the musicians felt secure in these choices, thanks to the inclusion of another piece on the program (which was to repeat on Sunday) that allowed them to strut more ecstatically. The 1996 composition “LA Variations,” by the former Los Angeles Philharmonic music director Esa-Pekka Salonen, was designed as a showcase for this orchestra, and it continues to sound marvelous in its hands. The work’s varied instrumental colors are still Technicolor in their projected brilliance. The balance — even in thickly orchestrated passages — still has a punchy vibrancy worthy of a surround-sound theater mix. And its final minutes may have gained some rhythmic buoyancy under Mr. Dudamel’s watch. Somewhat less dazzling was the orchestra’s trip through Beethoven’s Op. 56 (known as the “Triple Concerto”). The piano, violin and cello soloists — all drawn from the Philharmonic’s regular cast — carried a brisk energy throughout the demanding work. Yet they could also sound taxed during some of its toughest slaloms. Mr. Dudamel pushed out some effervescent, courtly pulses, though this sometimes necessitated speeding past the work’s most captivating harmonic turns. Though as it happens, this orchestra has not planned or marketed its centennial season around the standard repertory. With more than 50 commissions planned for this year — and mini-festivals devoted both to the Harlem Renaissance and to the composers associated with the Fluxus movement — the Los Angeles Philharmonic is going big on modern and contemporary items. During this first weekend of its season, the orchestra’s skill in works written over the past three decades amounted to a thrilling omen for the coming year.",The New York Times
2019,Review: A Three-Way Smackdown Over ‘The Lifespan of a Fact’,"Critic’s Pick When the journalist John D’Agatta wrote a play called “The Lifetime of a Fact” in 2003, he couldn’t have known that it would one day become a terrifically engaging Broadway drama starring a boy wizard. Please note that there are six to eight mistakes in that sentence, depending on what you consider a mistake. For one thing, “D’Agata” has only one “T.” The show that opened on Thursday at Studio 54, starring Daniel Radcliffe along with Bobby Cannavale and Cherry Jones, is not a drama but a topical comedy, and it’s called “The Lifespan of a Fact” — not the “Lifetime.” Also, the play wasn’t written in 2003, or by Mr. D’Agata; rather, it was written, more recently, by a threesome whose official credit I would prefer to omit because, well, I just find it clumsy: Jeremy Kareken & David Murrell and Gordon Farrell. If you think that’s lordly of me, wait until you get a whiff of the play’s ripe caricature of Mr. D’Agata, especially as inhabited by the swaggering Mr. Cannavale. “I’m not interested in accuracy,” he crows. “I’m interested in truth.” Which is why he doesn’t consider himself a journalist (that’s mistake No. 6) but rather a lyric essayist, for whom atmosphere takes precedence over facts and rhythm over reliability. So does that mean he can just make stuff up, or fudge details, as I have been doing? “The Lifespan of a Fact” is based on a book of the same name that Mr. D’Agata wrote with Jim Fingal in 2012. That book, in turn, was based on an argument that began when Mr. Fingal, as a young intern, was assigned to fact-check an article — sorry, essay — that Mr. D’Agata had written about a teenager’s suicide at a Las Vegas resort in 2002. As portrayed deliciously here by Mr. Radcliffe, who has now put the boy wizard persona well behind him, the character of Fingal is D’Agata’s spiritual and physical opposite: scruffy, small, awkward and perseverant. He is a mosquito to Mr. Cannavale’s lion. Assigned by the editor of a glossy New York magazine to fact-check the 15-page essay, he produces a 130-page spreadsheet outlining his queries. Some address tangible if arguable details: Were the resort’s paving bricks red, or, less interestingly, brown? Some are epistemological: How could D’Agata have known what he couldn’t have witnessed? And some suggest that the author has trespassed deep into the territory of flat-out fiction. Never more than now, with accusations of fake news flying, have these questions bedeviled writers — whether journalists or essayists or critics. Mistakes and lies and opinions are interchangeable with facts in the Twitterverse, creating a nimbus of doubt (and opportunities for “artistic” embellishment) around everything. This apparently affects playwrights, too. The New York glossy that’s set to publish D’Agata’s essay in “The Lifespan of a Fact” is not where the real Mr. Fingal interned. He worked for a magazine called The Believer — then based in San Francisco — to which the essay was submitted after Harper’s Magazine rejected it because of factual inaccuracies. That’s assuming you believe accounts by The New York Times and The Daily Beast. And The Believer’s checking process, which in reality stretched to seven years, gets compressed in the play to a five-day ordeal with a looming deadline at the printer. Which wouldn’t matter except that, to anyone in publishing, the idea of plugging so many gaping factual holes in so little time seems ludicrous. We can at least be grateful for one of the authors’ liberties: the invention of Emily Penrose, the fair but tough-minded editor of the magazine. Without her, “The Lifespan of a Fact” would just be two sides of an unchanging argument, repeated with variations ad infinitum. Actually, that’s what it is anyway, but Penrose, serving as the fulcrum of the argument, gives it nuance and real-world meaning. She sees publishing in the context of a deteriorating ecosystem of knowledge, with enormous political and societal implications. The role also gives Ms. Jones the rare chance to shine in lighter material than her customary Broadway assignments. Having her way with snappy, curse-speckled dialogue, she suggests a blend of Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson, the sparring editor and reporter from “The Front Page.” That she is also, like those archetypally male characters, a totally professional creature makes this the rare play in which the female apex of the triangle is not a romantic figure. I give “The Lifespan of a Fact” big Bechdel points for this but also some engagement demerits. Foreclosing on every attempt Fingal makes to suss out details of her personal life, she forecloses on us as well. If that’s dry, the dryness is in some ways a fascinating choice. There used to be a genre of Broadway comedy meant to be topical but not emotional. Plays like “Take Her, She’s Mine,” “Fair Game” and “Norman, Is That You?” treated current social issues — the generation gap, divorce, gay liberation and such — as touchstones for an evening’s light entertainment, and were welcome as such. So is this one. But “The Lifespan of a Fact” clearly wants to be more than that, even if its raw material isn’t strong enough for drama. (For one thing, the original essay, eventually titled “What Happens There” and excerpted in the dialogue, is so purple it hardly seems worth the fuss.) The authors compensate by inflating D’Agata’s supposed artistry to Didion-like proportions and Fingal’s tenacity to mania. Though compression and exaggeration are key writing tools — I’m using them now — they are perhaps more suspicious in a play about the dangers of compression and exaggeration than in the kind of boulevard comedies that “The Lifespan of a Fact” otherwise resembles. Here they serve to disguise the “fact” that the variously conjoined authors never solved the problem of how to keep the conflict moving toward some climax — any more than D’Agata and Fingal ever agree on a definition of truth. After 95 minutes of plausible arguments on each side, the play ends with a shrug. They’re both right! And both wrong. So was I mistaken — or just selectively truthful — in calling “The Lifespan of a Fact” “terrifically engaging” just 20 paragraphs ago? It might have been more accurate, if less marquee-ready, to have written “terrifically engaging but not as smart as it thinks.” That this doesn’t much matter as the play pingpongs along is the result of a terrific comic staging by Leigh Silverman. With its cast, its dead-on timing, its perfect set by Mimi Lien and sound design by Palmer Hefferan, it would probably nail its laughs even without the dialogue. It’s what you call a good time. Of course, I can’t prove that. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2019,Review: A Thrilling ‘Ferryman’ Serves Up a Glorious Harvest Feast,"Critic’s Pick No matter what sort of spread you’ve planned for your Thanksgiving dinner, it won’t be a patch on the glorious feast that has been laid out at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater. That’s where Jez Butterworth’s thrilling new play “The Ferryman” opened on Sunday night, with a generosity of substance and spirit rarely seen on the stage anymore. There is, for the record, a whopping celebratory meal at the center of this endlessly vibrant work, directed with sweeping passion and meticulous care by Sam Mendes. Its main course is a goose, which has figured as a living creature in earlier scenes, and the repast appears to be more than enough to feed the 17 revelers gathered at an overladen table in rural Northern Ireland in 1981. But the real sustenance provided here comes from the sheer abundance within a work that picked up most of the awards on offer during its London run last year. This is theater as charged and cluttered and expansive as life itself. And the three and a quarter hours and 21 speaking parts required to tell its story — which is at once a shivery suspenser, a hearthside family portrait, a political tragedy and a journey across mythic seas — barely seem long enough to contain all it has to give us. The last time a new drama with this breadth of scope and ambition appeared on Broadway was seven years ago. That was Mr. Butterworth’s “Jerusalem,” in which a small-time, middle-aged country drug dealer (played by a monumental Mark Rylance) became a majestic emblem of an ancient, heroic England. With “The Ferryman,” Mr. Butterworth is again assessing the chokehold of a nation’s past on its present. But now it is Northern Ireland at the height of the politically fraught period known as the Troubles. (We hear radio reports of the dying Irish Republican hunger strikers in the Maze prison.) And he mines the folksy clichés of Irish archetypes — as garrulous, drink-loving, pugilistic souls — to find the crueler patterns of a centuries-old cycle of violence and vengeance. If this sounds forbidding, rest assured that “The Ferryman,” which stars the magnetic Paddy Considine as the head of a ginormous family, never feels remotely polemical. Even more than “Jerusalem,” it revels in the addictive power of artfully unfolded narratives. And I mean all kinds of narratives: classical epics and homey fairy tales, barroom ballads and chronicles of hopeless love, multigenerational family sagas and ghost stories with a body count. Most of the action may be confined to a room in a farmhouse, which — as rendered in Rob Howell’s splendid set, with eloquent lighting (Peter Mumford) and sound (Nick Powell) — exhales an air of hard-won comfort under siege. Yet, like a James Joyce short story in which the everyday and the eternal live cheek by jowl, “The Ferryman” seems to sprawl over an entire, divided country. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] We are specifically in the overflowing home of Quinn Carney (Mr. Considine, in a superb, anchoring performance), whose domain improbably accommodates his seven children (ages 9 months to 16), his invalid wife, Mary (Genevieve O’Reilly), and his misanthropic, staunchly Irish republican aunt and Virgil-quoting uncle, both of whom are called Pat (pricelessly portrayed by Dearbhla Molloy and Mark Lambert). Living under the same roof are his sister-in-law, Caitlin (Laura Donnelly, in a heart-stopping performance that won her the Olivier Award), and her understandably broody adolescent son, Oisin (Rob Malone). Then there’s Quinn’s overgrown, childlike (and English-born) handyman, Tom Kettle (Justin Edwards). And because it is harvest day, their ranks are swelled by three young strapping male relatives, the Corcoran boys. But wait! I haven’t mentioned the unwelcome visitors who show up at nightfall, casting dark shadows on the glowing Carney homestead: a craven priest, Father Horrigan (Charles Dale), and the courtly, sinister Irish republican kingpin Mr. Muldoon (Stuart Graham) and his henchmen (Dean Ashton and Glenn Speers), whom we have already met in the play’s ominous prologue, set in a graffiti-sprayed back alley in the nearby city of Derry. As unlikely as it seems, you’ll have no trouble keeping these characters apart. Each bristles with vivid specificity, even those in nonspeaking parts, like the infant Bobby, a feral rabbit and the aforementioned goose. Mr. Butterworth has taken pains to define every one of them, and the cast repays him with performances that blaze unconditionally in the moment. Of equal importance, this being a play about the Irish, are the living dead, the absent souls who exist not only as scrupulously maintained memories but as catalysts in an increasingly eventful plot. Among them are the late family patriarch, whose black-and-white portrait looms as a benediction and a curse, and his romantically remembered brother, who was killed by British troops during the Easter Rising in Dublin of 1916. But of most immediate importance is Caitlin’s missing husband, Seamus, whose eerily well-preserved, 10-years-dead body is discovered in a bog shortly before the play begins. The news will shatter the cozy, vigilantly guarded order of the Carney household and drag shadowy deceptions into the harsh light. This process is achieved through a propulsive plot that never stops churning forward even as it keeps looking backward, conjuring a cyclical nightmare of history from which no one escapes. Yet the story also embraces a multitude of exuberantly full individual scenes, of a number and richness rarely seen outside of Shakespeare. Mr. Mendes, who has become world famous as the director of James Bond blockbusters (and brilliantly staged the New York-bound “The Lehman Trilogy”), here endows these vignettes with a master craftsman’s artisanal detail. There is, for instance, that astonishing scene that introduces us to Quinn and Caitlin, alone in the early hours of the harvest day, dancing to “Street Fighting Man” with such exhilarated abandon that a lampshade catches fire. Or the very different arias of histories ancient and living delivered by Uncle and Aunt Pat. Or any of the moments when the usually senescent Aunt Maggie Far Away (Fionnula Flanagan) swerves into focus, with visions of those baleful spirits, the banshees, that feel all too real. I can’t shake the memory of the cinematic image that concludes the first act, in which a solemn young man creeps in from the shadows to stare at the suspended carcass of a slaughtered goose, as if in mortal kinship. And I must mention the five excellent young actors — Fra Fee, Niall Wright, Tom Glynn-Carney, Conor MacNeill and Michael Quinton McArthur — who bring such force to a fraternal drinking session that it turns into an anatomy of a civil war. And yes, there is indeed one of those rousing, classically Irish scenes of celebratory song and dance. It occurs amid the great harvest dinner, and it has three distinct phases. It begins with sprightly Celtic fiddle music and show-off knees-up and step-dancing moves. Then the music is changed, brusquely, to contemporary rock (“Teenage Kicks” by the Undertones), and the mood turns frantically, dangerously sensual. Finally, there is an a cappella performance of the Irish song of rebellion “A Row in the Town,” and it is performed with an anger that wakens the senses as it freezes the blood. The warring feelings embodied by these three, very different numbers are, you realize, all genetically encoded in every one of the characters here. By the end of this magnificent drama, Mr. Butterworth has connected the contradictions with a skill that takes the breath away. This information was last updated on May 16, 2019",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Vital and Sweeping ‘Porgy and Bess’ Debuts in London,"LONDON — It’s all too easy for the characters of George Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess” to come across as caricatures, though Gershwin worked hard to avoid that trap. In a 1935 article for The New York Times shortly after “Porgy and Bess” opened on Broadway, he wrote that in depicting the story of poor black people living in waterfront tenements in Charleston, S.C., he adapted his method as a composer to “utilize” the drama, humor, superstition, religious fervor, dancing and “irrepressible high spirits of the race.” In order for a production not to seem steeped in stereotypes, the performances must reflect the profound respect that Gershwin and his libretto collaborators, Ira Gershwin, his brother, and DuBose Heyward, brought to this great but difficult-to-realize folk opera, as they called it. Emotional depth and belief in the characters run through the English National Opera’s first-ever production of “Porgy and Bess,” which opened here earlier this month, directed by James Robinson. Hewing to the request of the Gershwin estate to cast the opera with black singers, this production features the stalwart baritone Eric Greene as the disabled, utterly decent beggar Porgy, and the richly expressive soprano Nicole Cabell as Bess, a glamorous but troubled woman who struggles to break free of an abusive relationship with Crown, a cocky stevedore, fiercely performed by the youthful baritone Nmon Ford. Perhaps best of all is the impassioned, radiant soprano Latonia Moore as Serena. Even when wailing with grief over the pointless killing of her husband (“My Man’s Gone Now”), she shows the tragic grandeur of this powerful character. (Ms. Moore sang “Aida” to acclaim with the company last year.) The English National recruited an impressive ensemble of 40 singers especially for this production from Britain, America, South Africa, New Zealand and elsewhere, performers who not only sing splendidly but also act and dance dynamically. During Gershwin’s ensemble scenes, the various choristers project their own individualized characters. Next month, they will join the company’s full-time chorus for a special staged performance of Benjamin Britten’s “War Requiem.” This “Porgy and Bess,” a joint production with the Metropolitan Opera and the Dutch National Opera, is coming to the Met next season. But, of necessity, I can only give an incomplete report on the staging. Before the curtain went up on Friday’s performance at the London Coliseum, it was announced that a glitch had developed during the afternoon in the stage’s revolving mechanism. The company decided to forge on with a “reduced” version of the production. Certain ensemble scenes, notably a church picnic on Kittiwah Island, had to be played in the forestage area without the intended scenic backing. Perhaps this limitation actually inspired everyone. During that scene, cast members and choristers cut loose as they executed some gyrating dance movements and sang Gershwin’s music with full-bodied sound and crispness. I can report on the general look and atmosphere of the production. The tenements where the residents of Catfish Row live are starkly suggested (by the set designer Michael Yeargan) with isolated wood beams that frame two tiers of interconnected rooms and spaces. With endearing costumes by Catherine Zuber that are true to the opera’s 1920s setting, the tenement dwellers mostly wear worn house dresses or work clothes, all in shades of russet and brown. Heyward originally wrote this story as a novel, which he and Dorothy Heyward, his wife, adapted into a successful play, which became the basis for the libretto. DuBose Heyward wrote all lines for recitative setting (which Gershwin does skillfully) and many song lyrics (including “Summertime”), while Ira Gershwin wrote lyrics for the songs in a Broadway vein, like the wonderful “It Ain’t Necessarily So.” Some people find it awkward today to hear recitative and ensembles with lines like “Roll dem bones/Oh, my brudder,” which the men sing as they play a game of craps. But in the way this committed cast conveys the text, the words seem less like stilted slang than a regional dialect with an everyday elegance. In scene after scene, Mr. Robinson gets the balance right in showing both the effects of oppression on this community and the defiant heartiness of its members. These are mostly God-fearing people who sincerely believe that Maria (the formidable Tichina Vaughn), the keeper of a cookshop and the town matriarch, can ward off illness through her prayer. Yet there are few fundamentalists among them. When the aptly named Sporting Life, a dope peddler (the vibrant Frederick Ballentine), debunks a literal reading of the Bible in “It Ain’t Necessarily So,” even the churchgoers who find him objectionable laugh, carry on and sing along. After all, this staging suggests, who could actually believe that Methuselah lived more than 900 years? The tragic elements of the work are played straight and grimly. Ms. Cabell’s Bess has some raw attraction to Crown, but also an addiction to the “happy dust” only he can supply. Her problem could not have seemed more current, given the opioid crisis affecting the United States. The opera is a portrait of a deeply patriarchal culture: Even the basically good men boss their wives around. In this #MeToo moment, Crown’s physical bullying of Bess is chilling. Porgy’s gentleness and sympathy, beautifully rendered by Mr. Greene, draw Bess to him for Gershwin’s soaring love duets. At least for a while, he saves her. Gershwin spent a summer with Heyward, a Charleston native, living in that area, exploring the music and culture of its black residents. But he made a point, as he wrote in his Times article, of composing his own folk music and spirituals for his score. He didn’t want to borrow material. And he wanted the music “to be all of one piece.” The job of making it sound that way finally fell to the conductor here, the excellent John Wilson, who led a performance that had sweep, shape and vitality, as well as rarer qualities: precision and restraint. The technical glitches that night were all in the staging, not in the pit.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Voyage of Teachable Moments in ‘India Pale Ale’,"It’s a conversation that Basminder Batra, known to her friends as Boz, would just as soon not have. But since yet another well-intentioned but clueless white dude has asked her where she’s from — he means, really from — and even more annoyingly, “What are you?,” Boz has once again hefted the too-familiar burden of explaining her family’s history. Yes, she grew up in this very state of Wisconsin, only an hour away from the bar she is opening in Madison. That’s the scene of this strained encounter, which occurs about halfway through Jaclyn Backhaus’s “India Pale Ale” at City Center Stage I. Boz’s parents were born in her hometown, Raymond, too, amid “one of the highest concentrations of Punjabi populations in the world” outside of India. Boz, played by the luminous Shazi Raja, delivers this and other helpful information — including what IPA on a beer bottle stands for (it’s the same as the play’s title) — with a friendly but weary patience. Her life, she says with a sigh to her unsophisticated new friend, Tim (Nate Miller), often feels like “a series of teachable moments.” That’s a fair, if only partial, description of Ms. Backhaus’s new play, which opened on Tuesday night in a Manhattan Theater Club production. “India Pale Ale,” directed with studious effervescence by Will Davis, is a cheerfully instructive work, created with the aim of bridging one of the many cultural gaps in these dangerously divided United States. Ms. Backhaus demonstrated that pedagogy and entertaining playwriting are not necessarily incompatible when her “Men on Boats” became a sleeper hit Off Broadway three years ago. That work, inventively staged by Mr. Davis, ingeniously repopulated John Wesley Powell’s 1869 rafting expedition into unmapped Western territory. The members of Powell’s team were all male, and so the characters remained in Ms. Backhaus’s play. But she stipulated that these men be embodied by “racially diverse actors who are female-identifying, trans-identifying, gender fluid and/or nongender-conforming.” Through that casting directive, “Men on Boats” became a canny deconstruction of period machismo, a reminder that ostensible theatrical stunts can reap big creative dividends. “India Pale Ale” introduces its own unexpected juxtaposition of archetypes. Batra family legend has it that Boz is descended from the sort of romantic, marauding pirate once associated with swashbuckling movies starring Errol Flynn. His name was Brown Beard, and he is regarded as a tutelary ghost by Boz and her father, Sunny (Alok Tewari); her mother, Deepa (Purva Bedi); and her younger brother, Iggy (Sathya Sridharan). When times are hard, the clan remembers its intrepid Punjabi ancestor, who dared to sail unknown waters on a hijacked ship carrying a precious cargo of beer. The Batras lift one another’s spirits by talking in the growly mode of eye-patch-wearing cartoon sea captains. As Boz’s wise, earthy grandmother (Sophia Mahmud), says, “A little ‘yaaargh’ never hurt nobody.” It is the ghost of Brown Beard that Boz invokes as, at 29, she leaves Raymond to open a bar in Madison. More generally, Brown Beard’s world-traveling adventures become a metaphor for the Batra ancestors’ crossing oceans to settle in America, pioneering their own trail through an alien and not always receptive environment. Thus in one elaborate transitional scene we find the cast swimming through darkness in bright, eye-popping attire that combines 17th-century seafaring garb with traditional Punjabi dress. (Arnulfo Maldonado did the costumes.) Boz has summoned her inner pirate to deal with a tragedy that has been visited upon a Punjabi temple back home. That sequence is certainly the headiest in the production, which features a reflective-walled set by Neil Patel, transformed by mood-cueing lighting (Ben Stanton) and sound (Elisheba Ittoop, who also composed the original music). The scene also defines a turning point in the play’s tone, from chipper to momentously somber. Well, more or less. Even in its bleakest moments, the dialogue is punctuated with the wholesome teasing and perkiness of a family sitcom. The supporting characters, drawn in the same vein, include Deepa’s gossipy best friend (Angel Desai); Iggy’s thoroughly modern fiancée, Lovi (Lipica Shah); and his brolike best friend, Vishal Singh (Nik Sadhnani), who is also Boz’s former boyfriend. They’re a likably peppy lot, although all that matey “yaaargh-ing” can get a bit tedious. I’m assuming that Ms. Backhaus deliberately shaped her characters in the mold of familiar domestic comedies to underscore their universality. But they seldom register as fully dimensional beings. Ms. Backhaus endows most of them with a single defining quirk — like Deepa’s obsessive-compulsive urge to clean — that points to complexity without ever really going there. The script seems to be acknowledging the limitations of its own methods of portraiture when Boz, after dutifully enlightening the culturally insensitive Tim about American-Punjabi life, encourages him to bring his friends to her newly opened bar. “We can have a nice little after-school special,” she says. In fact, you could imagine “India Pale Ale” being successfully performed in American middle and high schools. Teachable moments are sadly necessary these days, to point out, among other things, that “What are you?” is a worse than obnoxious question. An earlier version of this review misspelled the costume designer’s given name. He is Arnulfo Maldonado, not Arnuflo. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: A ‘Lost Highway’ Suite Refracts David Lynch,"TROY, N.Y. — It’s a little off the New York City radar, but one of the country’s most invigorating hubs for performance and what’s fashionably called “time-based” visual art has been operating here for a decade now. The mission of the Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center — known as Empac — at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is more scholarly than ticket-sale-oriented. But when it puts on a public-facing show, it knows what it can do. On Saturday, as part of its 10th-anniversary celebration, Empac wrapped up a three-day series of performances with a demonstration of its unusual capabilities, namely the high-tech “dome” of speakers that surrounds listeners in its main concert hall. Olga Neuwirth’s 2008 “Lost Highway Suite” has its roots in her 2003 opera, based on the psycho-noir David Lynch film. The integration of electronic and acoustic sounds has always been a part of her approach to the film. (Ms. Neuwirth categorizes her “Lost Highway” as “a video-opera.”) The instrumental suite, lasting approximately 40 minutes, requires live electronic processing of six soloists, drawn from a larger chamber ensemble, here the International Contemporary Ensemble. Pumping out those multichannel electronics is a job that might normally be handled by just a few speakers. (The CD version of the full opera was mixed for 5.1 surround sound systems.) Empac’s 64-speaker dome — which made a vivid impression at its Spatial Audio Workshop last year — works at another level of density. Unlike movie-theater systems, in which the directionality of a spatially separated mix is always broadly perceptible, an “ambisonic” array like this one can have a hypnotic, hard-to-track power that ideally suits this Lynchian work. For Saturday’s performance, one of Ms. Neuwirth’s prior collaborators took part in reprogramming the electronic design of the “Lost Highway Suite” to take advantage of Empac’s speakers. This made possible some pleasingly complex morphings of timbre. At one point, after a long stretch of modernist chamber writing had elapsed, a repeating, jazzy trill emerged. Where did the acoustic playing of the saxophonist — in this performance, the impressive Ryan Muncy — stop, and where did the hall-enveloping electronic refraction begin? The presentation at Empac was as effectively mysterious as the most memorable, identity-obliterating sequences of Mr. Lynch’s film. Later, a sultry slow dance swelled up from the live ensemble, overtaking another of Ms. Neuwirth’s anxious, electroacoustic hazes. I thought of the scene in the film where a middle-age man, recently seen on death row, tries to get used to his new body (and identity) as a youthful auto mechanic, by dancing with his apparent girlfriend at a club that is playing the Smashing Pumpkins song “Eye.” Still, this passage in the suite sounded nothing like that sequence of the film. Ms. Neuwirth’s suite rarely employs references to the pop songs found on the “Lost Highway” soundtrack. (One short clip of Lou Reed’s performance of “This Magic Moment” was briefly audible.) And other than a few droning tones, held by a bassoon or a contrabass clarinet, there are few obvious nods to Angelo Badalamenti’s score for the film. And yet this suite follows the movie’s psychological program with startling facility. At the end of Saturday’s performance, the keyboardist Cory Smythe provided some shouty vocalizations. When distended and redistributed by the ambisonic speaker system, these brought across a nightmarish, climactic power similar to that of the film’s final shots. On the level of adaptation, Ms. Neuwirth’s mostly wordless “Lost Highway Suite” adheres more closely to the source material than her original stage piece, as the vocal writing in the opera stands defiantly apart from the frequently hushed and affectless performances Mr. Lynch drew from his actors. The score for her opera also ranges more widely in style, incorporating satiric-sounding fanfares more indebted to Weimar-era zeitoper than to Mr. Lynch’s American surrealism. With the suite a distinct, and excellent, work in its own right, fans of Ms. Neuwirth’s music should hope for a commercial recording of this adaptation-of-an-adaptation (even if the electronics need to be mixed down to two-channel stereo). At Empac, this memorable performance was just one in a series of important events. A few minutes after the crowd for the “Lost Highway Suite” exited the hall, the anniversary celebration continued in another theater, one floor down, with the premiere of a stage piece by the collective Moved by the Motion. The group’s co-founder, Wu Tsang, recently received a MacArthur “genius” grant for work in film and performance art. The fact that this prestigious prize came while Moved by the Motion was in residence here — developing a new work that features live dancers, life-scale video projections that double their movements, original music, and a script co-written by the author Fred Moten — was yet another reminder to keep an eye on Empac’s offerings.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Aasif Mandvi Makes You Want to Stop at ‘Sakina’s Restaurant’,"Critic’s Pick Azgi had stars in his eyes when he left his native India for New York City. But his nights have become haunted by an unexpected recurring vision. “I am a giant tandoori chicken wearing an Armani suit,” Azgi, now a waiter at an Indian restaurant on East Sixth Street, says. “I am sitting behind the wheel of a speeding Cadillac. I have no eyes to see, no mouth to speak, and I don’t know where I am going.” Ah, that feeling of being out of place and out of control, with a hint of luxury you can’t fully enjoy: What Azgi is describing in Aasif Mandvi’s play “Sakina’s Restaurant” is not the American dream but the American immigrant experience. Mr. Mandvi, the versatile writer and actor best known for his nearly 10 years as a correspondent on “The Daily Show,” has just brought back his solo comedy 20 years after its premiere. And at its funniest, which is often also its most uncomfortable, it has gained a new resonance. The naïve, enthusiastic Azgi (portrayed, like all the characters, by Mr. Mandvi) anchors the evening, which centers on the titular restaurant, rendered, in Wilson Chin’s set, as a homey joint adorned with photos, posters and multicolor lights. The place is named after the owners’ daughter. When we meet her, Sakina is a teenager who appears to be fully integrated: She wants to play in a band and still makes out with her ex-boyfriend, an American who mistook her for Iranian. But Sakina has also been betrothed since she was 11, and she ends up marrying a fellow Muslim named Ali. Like all the people we meet over the course of this tight 90-minute show, presented by Audible at the Minetta Lane Theater, Sakina must navigate the compromises necessary for integration in both her native and adopted cultures. Mr. Mandvi does not need much to segue from one character to another. Sometimes it’s a small accessory (aviator glasses for the owner, Hakim; a bright blue scarf for his wife, Farrida), but mostly he simply modifies his posture, slightly tweaks the way he speaks. Sakina and her younger brother, Samir, don’t have accents, for instance, though this does not necessarily help them blend in America. (And it’s always “America” in the show, by the way, never the United States. The first word is an idea melding into an ideal; the second is a reality.) Wisely, Mr. Mandvi and his director, Kimberly Senior — with whom he worked on the Off Broadway production of Ayad Akhtar’s “Disgraced,” in 2012 — have kept the story set in the blithe, pre-9/11 days of 1998. On a surface level, that means that Samir is still glued to his Game Boy and that Portishead’s “Glory Box” is playing during a scene in which Ali, stressed out by the need to relieve his sexual urges before getting married, goes to a prostitute named Angel. But the implications run deeper than vintage video games and songs: The show takes place in a different era, when being an immigrant of a certain faith certainly wasn’t easy, but it also was somewhat less burdened with stigma. After Ali tells Angel he’s a Muslim, he asks if she knows what that is. A pause. “Yes, it’s a type of cloth,” he adds. And suddenly, “Sakina’s Restaurant” has acquired a new, somber underlining, making us miss a time when ignorance was paired with benign disinterest rather than hate.

2018,"Review: After a Concert, a Nightcap to Demystify New Music","When a major orchestra performs the premiere of a new work, the piece is typically just dropped into an otherwise traditional program. The audience gets one crack at hearing it. And that’s that. Enter the New York Philharmonic’s Nightcap series, a new venture whose aim is to acquaint audiences with living composers featured in subscription programs by way of cabaret-like, post-concert events at Lincoln Center’s intimate Kaplan Penthouse. The inaugural Nightcap took place late Friday night, with an inventive, hourlong program organized by the 24-year-old composer Conrad Tao following a performance of his “Everything Must Go,” which had its premiere on Thursday as a kind of prelude to Bruckner’s Eighth Symphony. Both Nightcap and another contemporary music series, Sound On — which has its debut on Sunday at the Appel Room at Jazz at Lincoln Center, with a focus on the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen — take the place of Contact, the new-music series Alan Gilbert had introduced during his tenure as the Philharmonic’s music director. These new ventures are meant to be more informal. Still, Mr. Tao’s Nightcap could have used a little more music and a little less chitchat, though all the comments about the pieces were helpful. But demystifying contemporary music is essential work. Nightcap was a good start. At the penthouse on Friday, Jaap van Zweden, the Philharmonic’s new music director, introduced Mr. Tao, whom he first got to know as a prodigious 16-year-old pianist. (He spends most his time on the concert pianist circuit.) Mr. van Zweden said that, having commissioned Mr. Tao several times over the years, he had asked him to write a piece inspired by the Bruckner symphony that would segue — without a pause — into its first movement. But, as he explained, he hoped the Philharmonic audience would sort of feel that the Bruckner “was inspired by Conrad.” If only Mr. van Zweden had thought to offer these charming, revealing comments to the audience at Geffen Hall the night of the premiere. The Nightcap program, hosted by the violist and new-music specialist Nadia Sirota, demonstrated the breadth of Mr. Tao’s skills and curiosity. In a nod to Bruckner, he began with his arrangement of the composer’s “Ave Maria” choral motet, utilizing Vocaloid, a synthesizer choir. The voices sounded eerily (yet endearingly) high-pitched, nasal and slippery like a Bruckner motet performed by Alvin and the Chipmunks, embedded in the overall electronic weirdness of Mr. Tao’s music. This was no joke, but rather a young composer’s attempt to reanimate Bruckner through contemporary musical language and technology. He then introduced a close colleague, the dancer and choreographer Caleb Teicher, who joined him for an arrangement of another Bruckner motet, “Christus Factus Est.” With Mr. Tao on the piano, Mr. Teicher tap danced on a platform, sprinkled with sand that lent gritty sounds to his elegant gyrations. Later, joined by the experimental vocalist Charmaine Lee, they performed a freewheeling improvisation, mixing the sounds of Mr. Teicher’s sand-scraping footsteps; Mr. Tao’s digital groans, static and thuds; and Ms. Lee’s array of sustained tones, whispered words, gurgling sounds and vocal effects. For the final piece, Mr. Tao and Ms. Lee performed a structured improvisation that segued into “Heavy Rain,” a song he wrote last year with words stitched together from poems by a friend. But I only learned these details after the performance. I wish that, during his conversation with Ms. Sirota, Mr. Tao had spent more time explaining the pieces he was about to perform. To be a true bridge between composers and audiences, Nightcap events should be informative as well as informal. video",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Against the Odds, ‘Studio 54’ Sheds Light on the Club","Does the world really need another cinematic retrospective on New York night life in the late 1970s? Depends on whom you ask. I went in to “Studio 54,” a new documentary directed by Matt Tyrnauer, thinking definitely not. But the movie won me over. In part because Ian Schrager, who partnered with Steve Rubell to open the legendary and notorious nightclub in 1977 — and who with Rubell was sentenced to prison for tax evasion in 1980 — appears as the film’s primary interviewee. Mr. Schrager has tended to aggressively avoid the kind of spotlight Rubell, who died in 1989, seemed to crave. Now a successful hotelier, Mr. Schrager, speaking in plain Brooklynese, frankly and fondly discusses, for the first time on camera, the creation of the decadent disco and its lightning-quick downfall. The time he describes was an intoxicating and intoxicated one. It was also a callous one, which the movie’s first half overlooks a little, as various surviving habitués of the club bathe in a warm nostalgic glow in interviews. But that quality peeps out in archival film when Roy Cohn, the cold-eyed, admittedly ruthless lawyer who first achieved fame as an aide to Senator Joseph McCarthy, shows up to represent Rubell and Mr. Schrager with their legal travails intensifying. And especially when Rubell, on being asked by a TV reporter to comment on his partner’s arrest, shrugs and says, “I’m very fond of Ian.” The movie is a fast account that is sometimes a tad facile in its analysis of a cultural moment. But as Mr. Schrager’s personal too-much-too-soon story, it’s compelling.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: At Ballet Theater, a Gala Stage for Women’s Work","American Ballet Theater, while in some ways the most conservative institution in American dance, keeps reinventing itself. The company announced its initiative Women’s Movement in May, to support the work of 21st-century female choreographers. This cause takes further steps forward in the company’s two-week season at the David H. Koch Theater. The opening night gala, on Wednesday, was composed solely of choreography by women: Lauren Lovette’s “Le Jeune,” danced by apprentices and young performers from Ballet Theater’s Studio Company; the world premiere of Michelle Dorrance’s “Dream Within a Dream (deferred)”; and one of the company’s biggest and best-known hits, Twyla Tharp’s “In the Upper Room” (1986). The season also brings a world premiere by Jessica Lang, “Garden Blue.” In the 1970s, Ms. Tharp, coming from the world of experimental dance, revitalized ballet when she first worked with this genre, as she has often done since. Ms. Dorrance, a tap master, has had a similarly refreshing effect in recent ballet collaborations. I’ve loved much of both women’s work. Wednesday’s three ballets, all warmly applauded and effectively presented, showed three different views of dance and plenty of compositional skill. Despite finding points to admire in each, however, I enjoyed none of them. “Le Jeune,” like some of Ms. Lovette’s creations for New York City Ballet and at the Vail Dance Festival, is marred by a poor choice of music. Eric Whitacre’s “Equus” is a trite orchestral affair, with too many crescendos and showy effects. Ms. Lovette has a good enough ear to respond to its many changes of dynamics. She has also a wide range of choreographic resources, subdividing her 10 dancers. But to what end? The dancers looked skillful and exuberant; it’s not their fault that I find Ms. Lovette’s view of the sexes sweetly busy and prettily conventional. “Dream Within a Dream (deferred)” has music by Duke Ellington, arranged for orchestra by Allison Miller and Carmen Staaf, although some sections are danced only to the sounds of the dancers’ feet and hands. Ms. Dorrance handles multiple areas of the stage admirably and enjoyably (women slide along a horizontal corridor at the back, small groups tap on small surfaces near the front); the sheer changes of dance texture (the five women are in point shoes, then in heeled tap shoes) provide plenty of internal variety. Calvin Royal III, often one of the company’s most remarkable performers, here dances with physical freedom and stylistic versatility that single him out. James Whiteside’s confident flair with both tap and ballet is also terrific. But Ms. Dorrance’s “Dream” is not a dream of stylistic coexistence. Whereas her “Ex Pluribus One” at Vail this summer built up an amazing tapestry of different overlapping dance styles — like different species in one landscape — “Dream” doesn’t cohere: It just switches choppily from idiom to idiom. There’s one striking image in which women propel men: One man, then another retreats as a man presses her forehead onto his chest as she advances. Otherwise, the view of the sexes here is pretty standard: Gals and guys are all lively, but men have more character and do the partnering. There’s so much to commend in “In the Upper Room” that I ought to hold it up as a textbook example of stylistic diversity. Some of the cast are in sneakers, others in ballet shoes; both genres excel, and the stage world is large enough to contain them both proudly. Jogging, martial arts and academic ballet are just part of the cultural pluralism here. There are times when (even now that the work is more than 30 years old) it seems to reinvent pointwork. The complex array of weights and balances that come into play when a woman goes onto toe look new, modern, interesting. I wish I also wish I didn’t find this whole concoction synthetic. I wish I didn’t find its taped Philip Glass score bombastic and, as it proceeds, pulverizing. I don’t believe the posey, self-advertising stage behavior here; the more these dancers do, the shallower and phonier they’re made to look. In recent years, there’s been a rush to commission new works by female choreographers in ballet. Ballet Theater’s Women’s Movement is an important part of this. As women observed from the stage at the gala, this company was co-founded (and directed for decades) by a woman, Lucia Chase. And it has had female choreographers since its inception, notably Agnes de Mille and Bronislava Nijinska. Even so, there’s an obvious danger across the ballet world. Much — too much? — rests on the shoulders of a relatively small number of female choreographers suddenly inundated with invitations from multiple ballet companies. Let’s hope that something more important is also happening with a more valuable long-term effect: the active encouragement of creativity among female dancers and ballet students. Women in ballet have tended to concentrate on perfecting their skills as dancers rather than as choreographers; and even though female physiques and techniques have been intensely scrutinized (far more than their male counterparts), the pressure has grown only more intense when women come to make new work. Ballet culture itself surely needs to be reformed, from the foundations, to help more women see themselves as makers rather than made.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: At Fall for Dance, Formula and a Revelation (Sara Mearns)","In its 15 years, Fall for Dance — the festival where every ticket is just $15, and each program offers a colorful smattering of styles — has fine-tuned certain formulas: how to build, for instance, from an agreeable, subdued beginning to a spectacular, crowd-pleasing finish. And how to leave people aching for more. It’s easy, when you’ve attended many times, to feel a bit jaded. “Ah yes, the shirtless all-male ensemble that ends the night with a bang,” you might say to yourself with a sigh. (This time it was France’s dynamite Cie Hervé Koubi.) But it’s also hard to think of another theatrical event where dance is received so enthusiastically by so many people, year after year. And even as programming clichés irk, there are surprises to appreciate. On the first of this year’s five programs, which kicked off City Center’s 75th-annivesary season on Monday, the greatest revelation for me was Sara Mearns in “Dances of Isadora — A Solo Tribute,” making a welcome return after its premiere in March at Lincoln Center. (One Fall for Dance benefit: the chance to catch up on works you might have missed.) Ms. Mearns, a pre-eminent New York City Ballet principal, may seem an unlikely Isadora Duncan interpreter. As a pioneer of modern dance at the turn of the 20th century, Duncan was in many ways rejecting ballet, casting off what she saw as its constraints on the body and soul. But in working with Lori Belilove — who constructed this solo suite based on Duncan’s dances to Chopin, Brahms and Lizst — Ms. Mearns has stepped fully, transcendently, into a different kind of spirit, gentler than the dancer we know from City Ballet but with just as much power. Joined by the pianist Cameron Grant, Ms. Mearns, in gauzy pink, imbues the simplest gestures — outstretching an arm, tapping together her wrists — with expressive depth. In less sophisticated hands, Duncan’s yearning, frolicking, diaphanous steps can feel contrived or saccharine, but Ms. Mearns makes them thrilling. Her presence was especially invigorating after Jorma Elo’s “Bach Cello Suites,” for 10 members of Boston Ballet, which opened the program on a pleasant but anodyne note. While it was good to see this company’s fine dancers, Mr. Elo’s choreography (accompanied live by Sergey Antonov on cello) gave them little of interest to do. Revving things up after intermission was the premiere of Caleb Teicher’s “Bzzz,” a Fall for Dance commission. For this rousing, clever, sometimes madcap tap number, Mr. Teicher recruited the extraordinary beatboxer Chris Celiz, whose vocals meshed with the percussion of seven dexterous pairs of tapping feet (the choreographer’s included). With no additional instruments, “Bzzz” is a music-making triumph. An excerpt from Mr. Koubi’s “The Barbarian Nights, or the First Dawns of the World” — for 13 strapping men in bundled skirts — closed the program with a cascade of acrobatic tricks. Spinning on their hands, springing into back flips and catapulting each other into the air, they had no trouble bringing down the house.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: At This Professor’s Office Hour, No Time for ‘The Niceties’","Zoe Reed, the heroine of Eleanor Burgess’s “The Niceties,” is an overachieving undergraduate uncertain about her post-collegiate path. A political science major who spends her free time protesting, she is rebellious by nature. But if her affluent parents had their way, she would make a life much like theirs, building on the opportunities they’ve given her. “I show my black excellence to the world,” Zoe says, envisioning this version of her future, “and I hope, I hope, that the world sees it. I hope they aren’t too threatened by it, and I hope I don’t get so tired of the everyday awful that I snap.” The everyday awful. Gutting phrase, isn’t it? And truth be told, Zoe has had more than her fill of it already. Racism, whether subtle or glaring, confronts her at every turn. Justifiably furious, out of patience, she wants things to change. Now. Directed by Kimberly Senior (“Disgraced”) for Manhattan Theater Club, “The Niceties” is a bristling, provocative debate play about race and privilege in the United States, and it begs to be argued with — partly because Ms. Burgess has manipulated the contest in ways that feel unnecessary. But it is also a drama about the destructiveness of internecine fighting. Set in spring 2016, during the presidential primary campaign, it pits a pair of progressive women — a black millennial and a white baby boomer — against each other, even as Donald Trump gets ever closer to the White House. The parallels to David Mamet’s controversial classic “Oleanna” are clear: A 20-year-old undergraduate meets one-on-one with a professor who fatally underestimates her. By the end of their conversation, the professor’s career is in jeopardy, the militant student bent on its destruction. But where Mr. Mamet made his student a feminist straw woman menacing a man who doesn’t much deserve it, the likable yet merciless Zoe is the one we’re meant to root for here, against a professor who is guilty as charged. Zoe (Jordan Boatman, in a strong Off Broadway debut) is seeking feedback on a paper when she first arrives in the office of Janine Bosko (Lisa Banes), who teaches the history of revolution. Janine is warm, garrulous and eyebrow-raisingly unfiltered with a student she barely knows. She sprinkles their conversation with contemptuous generalizations about Zoe’s generation, and she blithely makes several remarks that are racially insensitive at best. The exchange is cordial enough, though, until Janine dismisses Zoe’s thesis — “A successful American Revolution was only possible because of the existence of slavery” — as “fundamentally unsound.” If Zoe leaves the paper as is, she won’t get the grade she needs, but making a stronger case will be all the harder because of the hole in the historical record where the voices of colonial-era slaves should be. The anger that’s been simmering in Zoe while she’s listened politely finds an outlet, and their argument begins: On one side, a historian who champions American democracy as one of the wonders of the world, its faults notwithstanding; on the other, an activist who looks at the nation’s history and sees all of the black lives that did not matter to its founders, to the people who have governed since and to the authors of its history. It’s odd that Janine, with all of her experience, doesn’t immediately suggest places Zoe might look to bolster her thesis. (I’m pretty sure I’ve thought up some decent ones myself.) And while Janine is not a cardboard villain, Ms. Burgess gives her some clunky lines that make her sound like one. “Everyone is tired of hearing about racism,” she tells Zoe, her hostility blatant, her language elementary. “You are so relentlessly negative and you make everything seem uglier, why would anyone want to listen to that? I hate seeing the world through your eyes!” It doesn’t stretch credibility that Janine might feel that way. It does seem unlikely that she would say so to Zoe, given who Janine believes herself to be: a good, liberal, lesbian, feminist intellectual who grew up working-class. How long has she been locked in this ivory tower, with no one to challenge her worldview? Zoe, who is too upset about the end of Barack Obama’s presidency to pay attention to the campaign to succeed him, is in some ways as oblivious of her entitlement as Janine is of hers. But Zoe does get affecting dialogue, one excellent joke about mansplaining and some very sharp zingers — as when she accuses Janine’s generation of “reading the children’s book version of American history your whole adult lives.” It would be a spoiler to say too much about how ugly and public the enmity between them gets — a maelstrom that compassion could have soothed. But this is where Zoe and Janine are most similar: in their refusal to give each other the benefit of the doubt, or to learn from one another’s pain. They look at each other, these two Americans, and see the enemy. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Berlioz, Rendered Newly Audacious at Carnegie Hall","Berlioz was 25 years old in 1829, when he submitted “La Mort de Cléopâtre” for the Paris Conservatory’s prestigious Prix de Rome. This dramatic scene for mezzo-soprano and orchestra painted Cleopatra’s suicide by snakebite in such lurid colors that the shocked jurors refused to award any prize at all. One professor told Berlioz he would have preferred “soothing music.” The young composer retorted: “It’s a little difficult to write soothing music for an Egyptian queen bitten by a poisonous snake and dying a painful death in an agony of remorse.” The following year, Berlioz won the prize with a much tamer cantata. But, at the same time, he composed “Symphonie Fantastique,” a phantasmagoric tone poem culminating in the orgiastic “Witches’ Sabbath,” which has become one of the wildest exhibits in the 19th-century orchestral canon. For most concertgoers, it’s the only Berlioz they hear. But on Sunday and Monday at Carnegie Hall, the English conductor John Eliot Gardiner led the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique in two thrilling Berlioz programs that showed off the breadth of his imagination. “La Mort de Cléopâtre” anchored the first program, which also included an overture; extracts from the opera “Les Troyens”; and “Harold en Italie,” a Byronesque travelogue for viola and orchestra. Monday’s concert paired “Symphonie Fantastique” with its rarely performed sequel, “Lélio,” a sprawling work for orchestra, narrator, vocal soloists and choir. No, soothing music is not what Berlioz was about. His works demonstrate a lugubrious fascination with human suffering and society’s underbelly. Many composers have written about death, but Berlioz takes on the process of dying like few others: In “La Mort de Cléopâtre,” slithering figures evoke the asp winding its way up Cleopatra’s chest as the music’s skin seems to crawl in twitchy shudders. Later, we hear the poison chromatically working itself through her veins. On Sunday, the coolly dramatic mezzo Lucile Richardot gave a fierce performance as the Egyptian queen, and brought touching vulnerability to “Adieu, fière cité” from “Les Troyens.” Emotional torment, too, is rendered as a physical experience by Berlioz, whether in the church bells of “Symphonie Fantastique,” sounding like auditory hallucinations filling the sufferer’s brain to bursting, or in the sour sforzandos that cut like shooting pains through stretches of tense, quiet music. But he was also capable of writing passages of pastoral freshness and tender lyricism, such as the aria “Chant de bonheur” in “Lélio,” which the tenor Michael Spyres rendered with silky and weightless phrasing. The Orchestre Révolutionnaire, which Mr. Gardiner founded in 1989, plays on period instruments that produce earthier tone colors than their modern equivalents. Some have since gone extinct, like the serpent and the ophicleide, precursors of the tuba that look like plumbing designed by Dalí. Since Berlioz’s time, wind instruments in particular have developed so that their sound more perfectly resembles the human voice. But in this earlier stage, a quality of thingness still inhabits the sound of clarinets and oboes. Their solos came across as the voices of animated objects in a way that marvelously suited Berlioz’s macabre vision. The boldness of the music was matched by the performers. At 75, Mr. Gardiner is relentlessly inventive and risk-seeking. Almost every piece on the program included an element of staging: Instrumental solos were subtly choreographed; musicians burst into wild song while playing; the entire ensemble — save the cellos — rose to its feet for the breathless “Le Corsaire” Overture and for the final movement of “Harold,” which depicts a debauch of brigands. The violist Antoine Tamestit was the beguiling soloist in that work, stalking the stage and turning a duet with a solo horn into a tête-à-tête at the back of the orchestra. Its massive forces deployed with wasteful heedlessness, “Lélio” is a rarity. A narrator — here the actor Simon Callow — stands in for the composer, musing on the power of art as medicine for the soul. The music moves through different moods and configurations, with chamber ensembles giving way to massive outbursts by the orchestra — stocked with two pianists — and chorus. The National Youth Choir of Scotland was wonderful, capable of gauzy delicacy and ringing fortes; the baritone Ashley Riches elegant in his brief moment in the spotlight. “Lélio” shows Berlioz feeling his way to new forms of dramatic expression. But the audacity of his imagination was never in doubt.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Bright Young Men Stoop to Scam in ‘Nigerian Prince’,"It’s not enough anymore to be mere Nigerian royalty, so Pius (Chinaza Uche), the central con man in “Nigerian Prince,” doesn’t confine himself to phishing. He’s always on the lookout for new ways to cheat poverty. Pius sees both a potential mark and something of himself in his teenage cousin Eze (Antonio J. Bell), who arrives unexpectedly — and unhappily — from America. Eze gets scammed before he even passes through customs in Lagos and emerges into its parched, weedy cityscape. After fighting in school, Eze was banished to his homeland to stay with his Aunt Grace (Tina Mba), a professor with a talent for tough love. Once this entitled princeling arrives, his mother informs him by phone that his mission is “to learn who you are and where you are from.” Oh, and she has canceled his return ticket. As for Dad back in New York, he won’t take Eze’s calls. If the books in Grace’s tiny apartment are any indication, her specialty is law, while her son’s is contravening it, a lifestyle that tempts Eze, who panics without his American privilege. In Grace’s stifling house, the electricity is dicey and the internet nonexistent. There isn’t a shower or extra bed. Just the third-world glaze of sweat and privation you see everywhere in this richly endowed land of economic imbalance, an atmosphere the film, Faraday Okoro’s feature debut, captures expertly. Is making do enough, or is there an honest way to prosper in a country with law, but no justice, where the corrupt police have jaunty berets, big guns and slippery loyalties?",The New York Times
2018,Review: Despair Rips at the Seams of Beth Gill’s New Dance,"Writing about the choreographer Beth Gill, critics have often described her work as “meticulous.” Every choice — the placement of an arm, the manner of taking off a sweater — seems exactingly considered. That might be why, so often, her dances unfurl with a sense of inevitability; she has tuned in to what has to happen next. Her latest, “Pitkin Grove,” which had its premiere as part of the Joyce Theater’s “NY Quadrille” series on Thursday, is no exception. But in recent years, Ms. Gill has applied her discerning eye to increasingly dark, chaotic, psychologically tangled worlds. Drifting away from the bright austerity of her Bessie Award-winning “Electric Midwife” (2011), she has arrived at dances populated by shadows of characters and stories, at once more human and more surreal. While her focus on form persists, precise as ever, she has carved out more space for feeling to creep in, or blast through. In the riveting “Pitkin Grove,” despair rips at the seams. With her set and costume designer Baille Younkman, Ms. Gill has blanketed the signature “Quadrille” stage — a platform in the center of the theater that allows for viewing from four sides — with squares of artificial turf. Beneath the green expanse lie mysterious bulky mounds, their consistencies revealed as the dancer Kevin Boateng, roaming alone onstage, cautiously touches, steps and reclines on them. One is squishy, another solid. At times he lowers an ear to the ground, as if seeking the source of the vibrations in Jon Moniaci’s subtly suspense-building score. Where is he? My mind leapt between public parks, rolling hills, burial sites, landfills. In her last evening-length piece, “Brand New Sidewalk,” Ms. Gill experimented with stripping away layers of clothing. Here — performing in her own work for the first time in 10 years — she strips away a layer of the stage, peeling up the fake grass to expose a gray floor strewn with discarded objects: essentially, trash. Danielle Goldman — the dancer who, in “Sidewalk,” carefully shed items of clothing — is now the steward of this detritus, resembling some kind of insect in head-to-toe pink. Coat hangers, a cardboard box, a rubber hose and more: Ravenous and reckless, Ms. Goldman gathers these up and chucks them offstage. The clearing makes way for Joyce Edwards, her presence as luminous as her gold-tinted cheeks and hair. Between swiveling in and out of boxer-like poses, loose fists over her face or shooting into the air, she watches as Ms. Gill alarmingly throws her naked torso into a trash can and emerges coated in gray paint. Having dyed herself the color of the floor and squirmed to the stage’s edge — where she lies motionless for the rest of the piece — Ms. Gill, it seems, has tried to render herself invisible. “Pitkin Grove” makes no explicit political statements. But in its simmering anger — its acts of tearing apart and throwing away — it channels the weight of the world. A tense, trembling final solo ends with the formidable Jennifer Lafferty on her knees, her arms outstretched and hands splayed as if saying — screaming — “Stop.”",The New York Times
2019,Review: Elaine May Might Break Your Heart in ‘Waverly Gallery’,"Critic’s Pick From the moment Gladys Green opens her mouth — which is the moment that the curtain rises on Kenneth Lonergan’s wonderful play “The Waverly Gallery” at the Golden Theater — it’s clear that for this garrulous woman, idle conversation isn’t a time killer. It is a lifeline. An octogenarian New Yorker, former lawyer and perpetual hostess for whom schmoozing and kibitzing have always been as essential as breathing, Gladys operates on the principle that if she can just continue to talk, she can surely power through the thickening fog of her old age. That she has clearly already lost this battle makes her no less valiant. That it’s Elaine May who is giving life to Gladys’s war against time lends an extra power and poignancy to “The Waverly Gallery,” which opened on Thursday night under Lila Neugebauer’s fine-tuned direction. Long fabled as a director, script doctor and dramatist, Ms. May first became famous as a master of improvisational comedy, instantly inventing fully detailed, piquantly neurotic characters who always leaned slightly off-kilter. Her partnership with Mike Nichols is still considered the gold standard for such quick-sketch portraiture. And their appearance on Broadway together in the early 1960s is recalled by those who saw it as if they had been divine visitations, blazing and all too brief. One can imagine Gladys Green having attended “An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May,” and saving the program. She might even have perceived a glimmer of her own vivacious self in that couple’s determined loquacity. In any case, the Gladys we meet in “The Waverly Gallery” — the title comes from the small rented Greenwich Village space where she shows art of dubious distinction — is conducting what might be called extreme improvisation. She’s bluffing, fabricating, groping for a direction in what must often seem like a void. Trying to convince her family and herself that she’s still capable of navigating the flux of urban life, Gladys always fills in the verbal gaps that confront her, even with words that may not be the right ones. At 86, Ms. May — in her first Broadway appearance in more than 50 years — turns out to be just the star to nail the rhythms, the comedy and the pathos of a woman who’s talking as fast as she can to keep her place in an increasingly unfamiliar world. First staged Off Broadway in 2000, with a very fine Eileen Heckart as Gladys, “The Waverly Gallery” was inspired by the final years of Mr. Lonergan’s own grandmother. It is a memory play in both its structure and its subject. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] Rendered through the retrospective gaze of Gladys’s grandson — Daniel (a first-rate Lucas Hedges), who lives down the hall from Gladys — it recalls Tennessee Williams’s guilt-drenched “The Glass Menagerie.” But Mr. Lonergan’s lens on the past is sharper and harsher. He is trying to capture, with almost clinical precision, the patterns of speech of a willful woman sliding into senility. At the same time, he is assessing the impact of such disjointedness on the helpless members of her family, who without even being aware of it sometimes find themselves adopting Gladys’s fragmented worldview. In other words, “The Waverly Gallery” is very much a group portrait, in which everyday life is distorted to the point of surrealism by the addled soul at its center. And Ms. Neugebauer has assembled a dream cast to embody the collective madness that seems to descend on those closest to Gladys. They include Gladys’s daughter (and Daniel’s mother), Ellen (Joan Allen, who wrenchingly combines filial devotion and resentment); her psychoanalyst husband Howard (an impeccably tactless David Cromer); and Don (Michael Cera, doing confident but clueless), a young painter from Massachusetts who stumbles into Gladys’s gallery one day and winds up showing — and living — there. Part of the painful pleasure of “The Waverly Gallery” is listening to how these characters listen to Gladys, and how, in responding to her, they come to question the reliability of their own words. As a screenwriter (“You Can Count on Me,” “Manchester by the Sea”) and dramatist (“This Is Our Youth,” “Lobby Hero”), Mr. Lonergan has always portrayed human communication as an imperfect compromise. “The Waverly Gallery” is his most literal presentation of that inadequacy. Gladys crams all silences with increasingly disconnected bits of autobiography and with peppy questions and catchphrases that she has probably used for decades. (“Got any coffee lying around?”) She’s so convinced that Daniel writes for a newspaper (he’s a speechwriter) that he no longer bothers to correct her. By the end, the identities of those around her blur with those of people long dead. But that doesn’t stop Gladys talking, even in her sleep. Daniel’s crystalline monologues of recollection aside, “The Waverly Gallery” often has the ostensible waywardness of recorded conversations. But no word is randomly chosen here, starting with Gladys’s opening line: “I never knew anything was the matter.” She’s talking about the end of Helen’s first marriage, to Daniel’s father, but it comes to suggest a more willful oblivion. And when she whimsically describes the loneliness of Ellen’s dog, who just wants a little attention, you know exactly what Gladys really means. Always stylishly dressed (Ann Roth did the costumes), Ms. May’s Gladys retains her coercive hostess’s charm. She ends most of her sentences with a practiced winning smile that now seems to be searching anxiously for affirmation. All the cast members function beautifully as quotidian detectives, looking for the patterns in the pieces. In a shattering moment, a teary Daniel hugs his mother tight, and you know that he’s wondering if his relationship with Ellen might one day mirror that of Ellen’s with Gladys. As near perfect as the performances are, the physical production occasionally lets them down. David Zinn’s urban set, with its vistas of the city beyond, weighs heavily on the playing area. And the intervals between scenes — which feature vintage street photography projections (by Tal Yarden) — feel ponderously long. Such objections dissolve as soon as Gladys and her clan reassemble into groupings that convey both claustrophobic intimacy and tragic, unbridgeable distance. Mr. Cera’s homey painter may be no Picasso. But in describing his domestic portraits and local landscapes, he sums up the essence of the play. “I tried to get the details right,” he says, “because that’s what you remember when you think about something, so I tried like hell to get them the way they are.” So did Mr. Lonergan. That’s what makes “The Waverly Gallery” a work of such hard, compassionate clarity. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Glenn Close Raises a Saint in ‘Mother of the Maid’,"Critic’s Pick Gliding into her 70s, Glenn Close is in her prime. Her performance in Jane Anderson’s four-handkerchief “Mother of the Maid,” at the Public Theater, is a triumphant blend of sharp sense and passionate sensibility, of an old pro’s expertise and a newcomer’s enthusiasm. This production, which opened on Wednesday night under Matthew Penn’s lucid direction, is Ms. Close’s second interpretation of a script by Ms. Anderson, who wrote the screenplay for her current film “The Wife.” In that movie — which has sparked talk of another Oscar nomination (her seventh) for Ms. Close — she offers equally dazzling evidence of the more subliminal skills of screen acting. But if you want to see a bona fide stage star at the height of her powers, drawing energizing sustenance from an audience’s rapt attention, “Mother of the Maid” is the ticket for you. Ms. Anderson’s robustly sentimental play, a take on a saint-in-the-making from a parent’s perspective, provides an old-fashioned showcase for the kind of acting with a capital A that once had Broadway theatergoers queuing around the block for returns. There was a time when Ms. Close would have been a natural for the Maid of the title. That’s Joan of Arc, the teenage French warrior and holy avatar, who is played here most credibly by a rough-hewed Grace Van Patten. In her early film career, in works like “The World According to Garp” and “The Natural,” Ms. Close was celebrated for her wholesome radiance and clean-scrubbed, androgynous beauty. Such traits are indeed the classic stuff of the Maid of Orleans in the theater, in performances by the likes of Julie Harris (in Jean Anouilh’s “The Lark” in 1955) and Condola Rashad (in Shaw’s “Saint Joan” last season). Ms. Close, of course, went on to exchange her dewy glow for a more feverish wattage, playing glamorous, strategizing villains in “Fatal Attraction” and “Dangerous Liaisons,” as well as the deluded movie goddess in the musical “Sunset Boulevard,” which she memorably reprised on Broadway last year. For Ms. Anderson’s new play, Ms. Close has shed all vestiges of surface sophistication to portray the humble but formidable, earthy but pious Isabelle Arc, a 15th-century mom to an exceptionally gifted and headstrong daughter. It’s easy to see where her Joanie gets her strength and incandescence — I mean, aside from a France-loving God. The premise of “Mother of the Maid” is smart, simple and encapsulated in its high-concept title. Ms. Anderson — whose credits include the play “Defying Gravity” and the HBO series “Olive Kitteridge” — revisits the well-plowed terrain of Joan’s path to martyrdom from the point of view of her proud but understandably fearful mom. What, after all, does a mother do when her adolescent daughter announces — with an age-appropriate mix of uneasiness and defiance — “Ma, I’m having holy visions?” Isabelle is both skeptical and empathic, wondering if Joan’s state of mind isn’t a byproduct of sexual awakening. And this being rustic, Renaissance-era France, Isabelle isn’t shy about making such a diagnosis. One of the strengths of Ms. Anderson’s script is its insistence on its leading characters’ connection to the land and the facts of a life that was often short and brutal. Listen, for example, to Joan’s account of the sensual heightening that occurs when she is visited by her heavenly guide, Saint Catherine. “The sounds around me, they get loud,” Ms. Van Patten’s Joan says with a perfect matter-of-fact astonishment. “Birds, cicadas, the bees in the clover, the sheep grinding their teeth.” She continues, “It all gets very large, you see. And wondrous. Even the dung balls on the sheep’s arses are gorgeous to me.” She sums up Saint Catherine’s effect on her in words that bring to mind a latter-day Katy Perry fan: “She fills me, she slays me, she takes me apart.” The balance here between contemporary vernacular and period detail is far more adroit than in the earlier version of “Mother” I saw at Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass., three years ago. That production featured a now excised character, Saint Catherine, as a wisecracking narrator, glibly pointing out the differences between then and now. Isabelle’s story doesn’t need meta-theatrical touches. And as Joan marches on to predetermined glory and doom, the revised script avoids irony for a more conventional account guaranteed to push the emotional buttons of any parent who has felt equal elation and terror as she watches her child grow up. Ms. Anderson doesn’t break new ground in exploring those reactions. But sometimes context can make the hoary feel bracingly fresh. Mr. Penn makes the most of that context’s novelty without overselling it. John Lee Beatty’s rustic set (which shifts neatly to royal sumptuousness for later scenes at the Dauphin’s court), Jane Greenwood’s homespun costumes and Alexander Sovronsky and Joanna Lynne Staub’s sound design summon a world in which people are unavoidably subject to the whims of nature. And Lap Chi Chu’s lighting speaks of a time when a shaft of sun, or the sight of a loved one wreathed in candlelight, might be perceived as a heavenly communication. The supporting cast does well by Ms. Anderson’s conversational, expletive-laced dialogue, in which the possibilities of barbaric invasion and divine intervention are regarded as everyday possibilities. Andrew Hovelson is spot on as Joan’s loutish brother, riding a gravy train to fame by association; so is Kate Jennings Grant as the patronizing, well-intentioned Lady of the Court, who treats Isabelle the way a Hollywood studio assistant might deal with the down-home relatives of a fledgling movie star. Dermot Crowley is excellent as Joan’s father, Jacques, an unlettered, strap-wielding patriarch whose suspicions of his daughter’s voices are never entirely quelled. His final, third-person monologue, in which he traces his character’s last days following Joan’s death, is a heartbreaker. As for Ms. Close, there’s not a breath or utterance that doesn’t seem both carefully premeditated and absolutely in the moment. She endows her Isabelle with a superstitious peasant woman’s trepidation in the face of the unknown and a mother’s doubts-vanquishing protectiveness. When Joan is imprisoned by the English, Isabelle is as frightened as she is fierce. But, as in the melodramas that were once bread-and-butter to great popular actresses, it’s the maternal fierceness that prevails. When, in her wrenching final soliloquy Ms. Close’s Isabelle talks about shaking her fists at God, you can’t help feeling that the Almighty had better take cover.

2018,Review: Hard-Boiled Play in ‘Bad Times at the El Royale’,"Characters enter the ominous digs in “Bad Times at the El Royale,” but they don’t always exit. This is hardly news. As the title suggests, El Royale — a motor lodge with pretensions of grandeur, which seems like an apt metaphor for this movie — isn’t a place for a good night’s sleep. It’s a spot for intrigue, desperation, swinging tunes and bloodletting. Mostly, it is a wellspring for a lot of talk, both seemingly idle chatter and carefully obfuscating oratories. Words are never casually exchanged at the Royale here but are instead deployed like weapons in what soon resembles a war of all against all. These many words have flowed from Drew Goddard, a screenwriter whose high-profile credits include “The Martian” and who made his directing debut with the self-knowing horror movie “The Cabin in the Woods.” He also directed “Bad Times” and imbued it with a similar self-consciousness, an attitude that has become almost a default in genre movies. Like many contemporary filmmakers who take on established cinematic forms, Goddard wants to play inside the frame and also to put his individuality on the picture. Optimistically set at the intersection of Agatha Christie and Quentin Tarantino, “Bad Times” is a hard-boiled thriller with flashes of a horror but largely a statement of authorial intent. The movie starts off on an ominous note that soon turns faintly comic after a solitary man (Nick Offerman) enters a motel room that, partly because of the frontal presentation, resembles a stage. A study in midcentury drab, the room is clean, borderline austere, meticulously arranged and one flickering light bulb away from David Lynch-style uneasiness. The man’s fedora and the silhouette of his clothing suggest that it’s the 1950s. He soon doffs his hat and begins moving the room’s furnishings to expose the wooden floor, which he then methodically tears up. One of the few silent characters in the movie, he doesn’t say a word; and then, in a flash, he’s dead. The story proper begins a decade later, circa 1969, now swathed in the mystery of the first man’s death. (The clothing and some television footage of Richard M. Nixon roughly indicate the period change.) The Royale no longer attracts the high rollers and big names it once did; all that remains of its once-glittering past are the framed celebrity photos hanging on a wall. The joint appears deserted, like an abandoned film set. Even after some guests start dribbling in, there’s a sense that something has been lost, a feeling that — as the blood spills — suggests that Goddard is teasing an idea, perhaps something about the shift from the 1950s to the ’60s. And maybe he is, though his attention is primarily invested in keeping things creepy, scary and off-kilter. In this, he gets a lot of support from his very fine actors, who each get a big moment (sometimes more) and reams of dialogue. They enter — stage left, stage right — a smiling, yammering, disparate group that seems like the windup to an elaborate joke: a salesman (Jon Hamm) walks into a motel with a priest (a soulful Jeff Bridges) and a singer (Cynthia Erivo). Over time, these three are joined by the motel’s manager (Lewis Pullman), a hippie (Dakota Johnson), a kidnapping victim (Cailee Spaeny) and a menace (Chris Hemsworth, having demonstrable fun). Goddard spends quite a bit of time putting these characters, all vague archetypes, into position. They smile and exchange small talk, initially moving in the cavernous entryway like plotted geometric points. One side of the Royale is in California, the other in Nevada, and a bold red line runs through the motel, dividing it into near-mirrored halves. The characters too are carefully divided between their public and private selves. They all have secrets, some benign and others dangerous, even lethal. Like veteran gamblers, they at first hold their cards close to the chest, keeping them from both the other guests and the audience until the bad times arrive, just as promised. For a while, the performances and the visual style keep you easily engaged, as does the pileup of secrets. Every character has his or her reasons, naturally, and each pulls you into another mystery. One has a hidden stash of cash, while another carries a badge. The secrets often tumble out after the characters check into their rooms amid the jump cuts, flashbacks and cinephile allusions (Kubrick’s “The Killing,” etc.). Goddard keeps everything smoothly, ebbing and flowing as the characters separate and join together, but at some point during this logy 2-hour-and-21-minute exercise you want something more substantial than even Hemsworth’s admittedly mesmerizing snaky hips.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Hilary Hahn Plays an Unabashedly Romantic Bach,"Encores have never been an afterthought for Hilary Hahn. In recent years, this brilliant violinist has commissioned 27 short solo pieces from as many composers to expand her stash of end-of-concert treats. She might have been expected to pick one on Tuesday, when she gave her first-ever violin-alone recital in New York at Alice Tully Hall as part of Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival. But her evening of Bach culminated in the sprawling, majestic Chaconne from the Partita No. 2 — the Everest of the violin repertory. Which one of her commissioned encores would she pick to follow that? None, it turned out. Instead, she scaled the Chaconne a second time. [Read about Hilary Hahn’s return to recording Bach after two decades.] It was a gutsy choice. But as I listened to Ms. Hahn, 38, embark once more on that 18-minute workout of runs, arpeggios and triple stops, I felt some of the magic drain out of the evening. That’s because this time around, my focus shifted from Bach’s genius to Ms. Hahn’s skill, and to the audible deliberation that went into every note. Sure, the occasional bass tone rang out even more forcefully on her second go; Ms. Hahn took extra time on one thoughtful pause and allowed herself a tiny slurp on an expressive slide from one note to the next. But her interpretation had clearly been hewed in stone, one meticulous stroke at a time. What most surprised me about Ms. Hahn’s take on Bach — she performed the first sonata and the first two partitas — was its throwback glamour. On Tuesday she played on an 1865 Vuillaume (one of two instruments by that maker that she used for her new Bach recording), producing a high-gloss sound of enormous power. There is an uncanny high-definition quality to the consistency of that sound: Across strings, in different registers and bow strokes, it maintains the same brilliance and focus. In meditative movements like the Adagio of the G Minor Sonata, Ms. Hahn takes an unabashedly Romantic approach, with slow tempos that allow her to spin out the melody in shiny ribbons. Her take on that sonata’s fugue, too, was designed to maximize sound, with short notes rendered solid — almost broad — and only the difficult triple stops ringing out harshly, like gunshots. Ms. Hahn dispatched fast movements like the Gigue of the D Minor Partita with such fire and panache that the audience erupted in spontaneous (and graciously acknowledged) applause. With sure dramatic instinct she zoomed in on moments of pathos, lingering on a sighing motif, or building up crescendos with muscular impatience. Her playing evoked the Bach of past generations, like Itzhak Perlman’s recording from 1988. Her contemporaries often now play this repertory with feathered bow strokes, gestural phrasing and swift tempos inspired by the historically-informed-performance movement. Ms. Hahn plays as if that shift never occurred.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In Boosting Blockchain, ‘Trust Machine’ Chains Itself In","A hodgepodge of boosterish arguments for blockchain technology, “Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain,” directed by Alex Winter (Bill of “Bill & Ted” fame), is not always a model of clarity, but it does a decent job of explaining the basic concept. Mark Jeffrey, an entrepreneur looking to blockchain for his start-up, describes the technology as a kind of shared, decentralized ledger: “A record of all the transactions, and it’s constructed in such a way that cheating is not possible.” Bitcoin has its own ledger, and so does every other cryptocurrency. The question that hovers over this documentary, which generally subscribes to the rosy assessments of libertarians and others who view centralization as inherently dangerous, is just how much potential blockchain technology has to do even more. We learn how, thanks to blockchain, neighbors in Brooklyn can trade solar electricity; how the technology might provide records for stateless refugees; and how it offers a way for fans to buy equity in an artist they like, without the middle men who come with sales on the internet. But the arguments contradict one another. (Blockchain means privacy! And also, look at these supermarket shoppers in Jordan who pay with eye scans instead of cash.) The film also conflates issues. You can believe that blockchain has potential and still think that Bitcoin is a bubble — as many economists, not just banking executives with vested interests, do. By the time Rosario Dawson, the narrator, points out that blockchain will likely require some form of regulation to survive, the movie has become an unwitting endorsement of the status quo.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In His Last Years, Oscar Wilde Is Far From ‘The Happy Prince’","A mopey yet gorgeous-looking wallow in the final years of the literary giant Oscar Wilde, “The Happy Prince” staggers around Europe with one eye on the grave and the other on the kinds of sorry mischief an unrepentant hedonist like Wilde could get up to. Happiness, however, proves elusive. Opening in 1897 as Wilde is sprung from a British prison after serving two years for gross indecency, the movie watches him wander, exiled and frequently penniless, through Dieppe and Naples before expiring in Paris of meningitis three years later. Brief flashbacks to the humiliations of his trial and the balm of opening-night adulation — represented by a sea of ecstatically applauding Victorian toffs — interrupt these peregrinations and underline the tragedy of his fall. As played (and written, and directed) by Rupert Everett, Wilde is less a sparkling wit than a sad, overweight sot, dependent on the kindness of strangers and the pity of old friends — and as much absinthe and cocaine as he can get his hands on. The locations change, but the desire for drugs and handsome young companions is constant, his knack for finding enablers well-honed. Surviving mainly on a small allowance from his estranged and sickly wife (a briefly seen Emily Watson), and the kindness of old friends like Robbie Ross (a fine Edwin Thomas), Wilde is partying more to numb the senses than excite them. Suffused with a sentimentality that Wilde himself would have deplored, “The Happy Prince” is narratively mushy and meandering. Yet, beneath the prosthetics, there’s genuine pathos in Mr. Everett’s portrayal of a man bitterly aware that his talents are unreliable armor against the perceived sin of his homosexuality. And when he sings a music-hall song to defuse a cafe riot, we see someone who has long used words to deflect violence and charm protectors. Scenes like this have a stand-alone power, infusing Wilde’s witticisms and clowning with tragic import and repositioning them as a bulwark against the hypocrisies of the age and the indignities of decline. An ill-advised reunion with Bosie Douglas (Colin Morgan), the selfish lover who caused his downfall, prompts Wilde to describe himself as “an old sheep with his butcher.” Like the sacrificial fairy-tale hero of the title, he’s a martyr to his self-destructive impulses, but Mr. Everett gives him a grandeur that prohibits pity. It’s a performance that far outshines his writing and direction, leaving the cinematographer John Conroy to pick up the slack with coppery, burnished images edged frequently in ominous shadow. In “The Happy Prince,” death is never far away, no matter how numerous Wilde’s “purple moments” in the sheets or drunken ditties in the cafe.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In Scathing ‘Downstate,’ Sympathy for the Devils","CHICAGO — Here’s what happened to the nice piano teacher: A man in steel-toe work boots stomped on him and broke his spine. And that’s not all. His wife stopped speaking to him, then died. Now he lives off food stamps, in a dodgy wheelchair, at the mercy of strangers. Arthritis prevents him from playing his beloved Chopin; instead, he hovers his hands over an electronic keyboard and mimes the melodies while listening to CDs. So sad! But did I mention he’s a pedophile? Is it still sad? Or is it now just justice? Decades before the action of “Downstate” — a great, squirmy moral-thrill-ride of a play by Bruce Norris — Frederick Jerome Nyberg admitted in court to sexual activity with two of his piano students. Andy was 12 and Tommy even younger. After many years in prison, then rehab, Fred now lives in a group home in Illinois that is only occasionally pelted with rocks or shot at by locals who are unhappy to have men like him in the neighborhood. “Downstate,” which opened this week at the Steppenwolf Theater Company here, is set entirely in that home — dreary, grimy, decorated with inspirational posters urging “greatness” and “perseverance.” Like everything else in the play, the jargon of uplift is quickly dismantled by Mr. Norris’s unrelenting and often painfully hilarious cynicism. The cant of victimology no less than the obtuseness of sexual victimizers is subjected to a live dissection. The obtuseness is not the challenge here; most of us come to the theater primed to see pedophiles as delusional. Just so, each of the four men in the house somehow maintains an air of righteousness regardless of how the justice system has judged him. Fred (Francis Guinan) is almost childishly amiable, given to saying things like “shooty shoot shoot” when upset, and ready at any moment to share his Nutter Butters. (No word or phrase in a Bruce Norris play is unconsidered.) For all his gentleness, he might be Fred Rogers. The others are more obviously defensive. Though tart Dee (K. Todd Freeman), a former dancer, had sex with a 14-year-old child actor who toured with him in a production of “Peter Pan,” he insists that their two-year “relationship” was consensual. Withdrawn Felix (Eddie Torres), who molested his preteen daughter, still calls his feelings for her “love.” Glad-handing Gio (Glenn Davis), whom the authorities consider a lower-risk offender, is disdainful of the other men’s perversions; the rape he committed was merely statutory. If Mr. Norris aims to amuse us by satirizing the personalities of these pedophiles, he is not the kind of the playwright to let us bask in our smugness. The play begins on a different note, with Andy, now a grown man, having traveled downstate from Chicago to confront his former abuser. Among the things he and his wife, Em, tell Fred is that, regardless of having served his time, he is “a fundamentally evil person,” undeserving of sympathy and a good candidate for suicide. Putting his thumb heavily on the scale, Mr. Norris turns what might otherwise seem to be natural anger into something repellently cruel. Fred may only be able to face his deeds with bland apology — “we do bad things to people because we have a problem in our thinking” — but Andy (Tim Hopper) seems almost unhinged. We are even encouraged to question whether sexual trauma is the real source of his stuttering rage when we hear evidence of his troubled family life well before the incident. Em (Matilda Ziegler) is in some ways harsher, egging on Andy’s revenge fantasies and bullying him to take “ownership” of his feelings. She sees confronting Fred as an act of civic bravery akin to that of the women now accusing their harassers during what she calls this “amazing historical moment.” She is not an outlier in her unabating hostility. Soon after she and Andy leave, Ivy, the men’s parole officer, breaks the news that they will no longer be able to shop at the local IGA because it falls within the recently expanded forbidden zone surrounding a school. As the constraints around the men tighten — they already wear ankle monitors and are forbidden smartphones and access to the internet — you can feel Mr. Norris winding them a noose. But in “Downstate” he is winding a lot of nooses. Perps, police and victims’ recovery groups all get theirs. And whenever the victims are scathed sufficiently he turns his attention back to the pedophiles — who, after all, as Ivy (Cecilia Noble) says, see themselves as victims too. Their anguishes are likewise balanced, so you never know where to land your sympathy. That is a risky proposition at a time when questioning the victim is impermissible, at least outside the theater. Seeing “Downstate” two days after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate, I worried that Mr. Norris might be asking too much of audiences electrified by the #MeToo movement. The play depends on our drawing fine distinctions between different kinds of sex crimes and between different kinds of perpetrators. Though men who prey on adult women have rarely before now been punished, for instance, the men in the group home, having preyed on children, have been punished repeatedly. Are their prison terms not enough? Would anything be enough? These are not funny questions, and “Downstate,” though at times uproarious, is not a comedy of horrors like Mr. Norris’s “Clybourne Park” and “Domesticated.” It is far too grave for that, making it in some ways his most serious, successful and difficult work. The difficulties — of tone and pacing and characterization — are for the most part masterfully handled in Pam MacKinnon’s staging, which keeps its balance not by staying close to the middle but by swinging with confidence, and even swagger, to the extremes of feeling. Even where the script seems to falter (an intended surprise near the end is not much of one) the production never does. The cast of Steppenwolf ensemble members and British actors — “Downstate” was co-comissioned by the National Theater in London and will move there next year — nails that balancing act. All of them, including Aimee Lou Wood as Gio’s suspiciously young co-worker, keep the ball of empathy in the air while hitting the comedy notes at the same time. For juggling, I have to single out Mr. Freeman’s performance as Dee, with its silky layering of wit and steel, its shocking blend of paranoia and pathos. That volatile combination may serve as an emblem for the play as a whole. “Downstate” is finally about the anarchic spirit of revenge, so understandable and yet so antithetical to justice. Mr. Norris is warning us to consider what may follow in the wake of even a healthy purging if the avengers are just as abusive as the abusers. It’s a lot to stomach, and rightly so. One of the things the theater is supposed to do is force us to face incompatible and frankly unpopular ideas. Not that Mr. Norris is discrediting victims overall, anymore than he is valorizing pedophilia (though Chopin, who fell in love with a teenager, is not an idle choice of music). Rather, in making the most extreme argument possible, he is consigning everyone, with a wicked sneer, to the same mire. We’re all human — aren’t we?

2018,"Review: In This Entertaining ‘Bacchae,’ Dionysus Is a Nasty Woman","The women of Thebes are dancing. The women are rioting. They are breast-feeding wolf cubs and disemboweling cows and using snakes as belts. Just because you’re possessed by a fierce and devouring god doesn’t mean you can’t be fashion-forward. Welcome to Ancient Greece (actually, a time before that) and also welcome to 2018. SITI Company’s flashy “The Bacchae,” directed by Anne Bogart at BAM Harvey, makes the play’s back-burnered anxieties about women and power feel very front-burnered and very now. “The Bacchae,” part of the Next Wave Festival in a new translation from Aaron Poochigian, is a late tragedy by Euripides. In most productions, “The Bacchae” isn’t centrally about women, though a woman commits its most heinous act. It’s a grudge match between two men — well, a man and a god. The god is Dionysus, the son of Zeus and the mortal Semele, though none of Semele’s relatives buy Zeus’s paternity. The man is Pentheus, Dionysus’s first cousin, another skeptic. When Dionysus rolls back into Thebes, he wants revenge on the city-state that doubted his mother. And he gets that revenge, bloodily. Now this is me talking and not Euripides, but see what happens when you don’t believe women? Why am I going on about women? Because this “Bacchae” casts Ellen Lauren, for many years SITI Company’s chief actress, as Dionysus and she plays the god with moussed hair and red leather pants, a female incarnation or possibly a nonbinary one. Her maenad chorus wears skirts on the bottom, blazers on top. (Something’s in the air: This spring Madeline George’s “Bacchae” update “Hurricane Diane” will offer a butch Dionysus.) Ms. Lauren’s incarnation makes an entrance to Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’s “I Put a Spell on You” (a song much too on-the-nose and frankly overused and frankly thrilling), strutting like an overcaffeinated Mick Jagger and slopping wine across the stage. This hyperbolic performance reorients the tragedy as a showdown between male hierarchy in one corner and androgynous anarchy in the other. As soon as Dionysus arrives, order collapses. As in Euripides, God-maddened women establish a radical separatist commune in the woods. Old men like the king, Cadmus (Stephen Duff Webber), and the seer, Tiresias (Barney O’Hanlon), bop around in fawn skins. The holdouts are Pentheus (Eric Berryman) and the soldiers he commands. Is Pentheus against Dionysus and the maenads because he’s the patriarchy’s golden boy or because his kink means he wants to be a maenad himself? It’s unclear in Euripides and it’s unclear here, though when Pentheus reappears in a wig and a dress (that part is in Euripides, too), Mr. Berryman has the rictus smile and rolling eyes of someone roofied by a god. Ms. Bogart’s deconstruction of the classic is sometimes silly and, if you try to trace its themes all the way through, often incoherent. But it’s also broadly entertaining — a nice surprise as SITI has a recent history of self-serious, no-fun works. This “Bacchae” is dynamic and accessible, sometimes very accessible, as when Dionysus gifts a patron with a glass of wine. “This is straight from Joe Melillo’s hands,” the god says, name-checking BAM’s executive producer. “It’s the good stuff,” the god adds, but more profanely. Is this rendition tragic? Not really. A mother’s harrowing speech, in which she realizes she’s murdered her son, is performed by Akiko Aizawa in Japanese, a distancing move that diminishes the horror. But in between the writhing and the boozing and the performance of “I’ve Gotta Be Me,” the show is also asking pertinent questions about female anger and female force. Whether Dionysus is male or female or nonbinary, the play is still about men freaking out when they discover that women can’t be controlled, that they can’t be made to stay at home, that they might have voices and desires and weaponry all their own. That they might fight back. Of course, Euripides being Euripides, a playwright tagged as so woman-hating that his colleague Aristophanes could write a comedy about it, this experiment ends very, very badly. But is this disaster really so much worse than patriarchal repression? Dionysus 2020, anyone? This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘1985,’ a Young Man Hides a Plague From His Family","The AIDS crisis, which will remain a global crisis until a definitive cure for the disease is found, is no longer at the foreground of our culture. The film “1985” is a moving cinematic sketch of a HIV-infected man living through the height of the plague. Written and directed by Yen Tan, the Malaysia-born filmmaker whose 2013 “Pit Stop” was about a conflicted gay man in contemporary small-town America, “1985,” is shot in a somber but rarely drab black-and-white. Mostly set in a suburb of Fort Worth, it follows Adrian, who left his evangelical Christian family to work in advertising in New York, as he visits home for the first time in three years. Greeted, if that’s what you can call it, by his gruff, taciturn father (Michael Chiklis) at the airport, he’s met at home by his mother (Virginia Madsen), who’s almost desperately radiating affection. His younger brother, Andrew (Aidan Langford), in his early teens, seems irritated with him. Adrian is gay, but not out to his folks. He’s also not well; AIDS has taken several close friends from him, and he’s recently learned that he too has contracted the virus. When Adrian discovers that Andrew is secretly listening to Madonna cassettes — secular music is forbidden in the house — the bond the brothers now share is overshadowed by the dread Adrian has nursed since the movie’s first shot. The meticulously composed movie sees Adrian negotiating with his nerve and his fear. A catch-up with an initially angry ex-girlfriend (Jamie Chung) painfully demonstrates how hard a time he has really trusting anyone. Cory Michael Smith’s performance as Adrian is a quiet marvel in a movie that’s superbly acted all around. The film’s intimate consideration of still-enormous issues is intelligent, surprising and emotionally resonant.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘A Bread Factory,’ Local Artists Face Off Against the World","Sprawling over four hours and screening in two parts, Patrick Wang’s “A Bread Factory” has an immense cast, a deliberate pace and thematic ambition to spare — but it also has a ground-level, plain-spoken modesty that renders it hypnotic. The Bread Factory of the film’s title hasn’t made any actual bread for decades. Rather, for 40 or so years, it has served as a community arts center for the fictional town of Checkford, N.Y. Locals perform in its plays. Children volunteer backstage. Visiting artists give classes. Even school board meetings — where the Factory’s fiscal fate is decided — are held there. Managing this quaint but essential institution are the headstrong theater director Dorothea (Tyne Daly) and her actress partner Greta (Elisabeth Henry). Part One, subtitled “For the Sake of Gold,” focuses on their attempt to combat the efforts of a well-funded, Chinese-owned avant-garde arts duo named May Ray to open a space next door and siphon off a key grant that allows the Factory to survive. This forces Dorothea and Greta, along with their friend Jan (Glynnis O’Connor), the longtime editor of the Checkford Journal, to try to persuade members of the school board to vote against May Ray, who have powerful lawyers and movie stars working for them. The film embodies the eclectic nature of the work on display at the Factory. We see a performance of Euripides’s “Hecuba” as it is blocked, rehearsed and ultimately staged. An independent filmmaker (played by a delightfully crabby Janeane Garofalo) conducts a testy Q. and A. after a poorly attended screening. A shy writer — the kind who literally faints upon hearing that someone knows his work — reads a poem about a dying gondola. Wang (“In the Family”) understands that the more we watch these artists and amateurs’ efforts — even if they’re somewhat ridiculous — the better we’ll come to appreciate the homespun, democratic vitality of such work. Contrast that with the hilariously surreal spectacle of May Ray, who march in perfect unison, accompanied by the sound of prerecorded applause. They sell expensive accessories, along with a sense that culture is a one-way transaction: We create, you consume. If all this sounds symbolic of small-scale, local struggles within a globalized marketplace, that’s probably because it is. And “A Bread Factory” feels like the kind of offbeat film that might screen at the Bread Factory. There’s a theatricality to the acting here — it’s never stagy or hammy, but it has a precise, pointed clarity that grabs our attention. That self-conscious, performed quality emerges further during the more expressionistic Part Two, subtitled “Walk with Me a While,” which offers up bizarre musical numbers and tap dance routines featuring selfie sticks and cellphones. Wang is a singular artist, but he taps into a rich tradition. The focus on the workings of an American institution may remind some of the expansive comedies of Robert Altman or the documentaries of Frederick Wiseman. But also, the blurring of the line between performance and reality, the embrace of an intimate theatricality, recalls the work of Jacques Rivette. These are cinematic giants, and this director may be on his way to joining them. An earlier version of this review misspelled the name of the actress who plays Greta. She is Elisabeth Henry, not Elizabeth.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘After Everything,’ a Young Love Blooms in Crisis","In the nimbly naturalistic drama “After Everything,” Elliot (Jeremy Allen White) and Mia (Maika Monroe) are 23 when they meet. They fall in love with all the robust energy of youth. They smoke weed in their crowded New York City apartments; they get matching tattoos. They have hot sex, occasionally made hotter by experiments with Ecstasy or a third partner. They also go to radiation therapy together. Mia shaves Elliot’s head in anticipation of the loss of his hair. Their matching tattoos, in fact, mark the spot where Elliot receives shots to treat Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare type of cancer that typically strikes young people. For their debut feature-length film, the writers and directors, Hannah Marks and Joey Power, repeatedly use montages to depict Elliot and Mia’s relationship, presenting snapshots of an affair as it rushes through stages and milestones, adopting a rhythm that outpaces even Elliot’s cancer. Elliot and Mia fall in love in a fever, and just as quickly they fall apart. As a cancer drama, “After Everything” is refreshingly mundane, focusing less on the high stakes of illness than on how two young people talk to each other in sickness and in health. Its matter-of-fact tone is carried through to all of its lived-in performances, including welcome cameos by Marisa Tomei and Gina Gershon. But the film’s successes rest largely on its lead actors. White and Monroe demonstrate natural chemistry, and they discretely suggest the private experiences of their characters, the youthful doubts that can’t be extinguished by passion. In unpretentious fashion, “After Everything” portrays the bittersweetness of a first love that blooms in crisis.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘All Square,’ Taking Big Bets on Youth Baseball","The director John Hyams has attracted the notice of some critics for his energetic direction of action movies, including “Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,” from 2012. “All Square” represents a change of pace from his film work (he’s been directing a good deal of episodic television also) in that rather than martial arts or gunfire, the primary source of kinetics here is … youth baseball. “All Square” is a comedy-drama about a bookmaker in a slump that’s directly related to the environment in which he’s forced to ply his trade. Michael Kelly plays John Zbikowski, who runs his illegal sports betting outfit out of a bar in a Maryland suburb. In a town where everybody knows everybody else, collections can be a real problem. Amicable proximity breeds a disinclination to cough up debts. “I got mouths to feed,” John complains in voice-over. One other mouth, actually: that of his father, played by Harris Yulin, a dyspeptic fellow who, years back, groomed his son for a career in the majors, then messed it up for him in a tragic, catastrophic fashion. This back story is a bit familiar; less so is John’s innovation to take bets on youth baseball games, which turns into a temporary payday. At the same time, he gives pitching and life lessons to the son of a former high school fling, played by Pamela Adlon. Hyams directs Timothy Brady’s script appropriately if not brilliantly (Hyams is also credited as a co-editor), but the movie’s main attraction, finally, is its cast. Kelly is a king among mordant underplayers. Yulin, a stalwart character actor, is reliably terrific. Adlon and Josh Lucas bring added value to their also-familiar characters. An earlier version of this review referred imprecisely to the baseball in the movie. It is youth baseball, not Little League.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Await Further Instructions,’ a Family Home Becomes a Battleground","Toxic patriarchy and all-access paranoia flourish in “Await Further Instructions,” Johnny Kevorkian’s genuinely upsetting, supremely British horror-sci-fi hybrid. Establishing a solidly dysfunctional family drama before things get full-on freaky, Gavin Williams’s cautiously escalating script gives the audience an anchor and at least two reasons to care when the nastiness hits the fan. Those would be Nick (Sam Gittins), returning home for Christmas after a long absence, and his Indian girlfriend, Annji (Neerja Naik), whose presence is catnip to Nick’s foulmouthed, racist Granddad (a snarling David Bradley). Trying to leave, the couple discovers the entire house has been sealed by a shiny-black, impenetrable membrane. Has there been a terrorist attack, or a nuclear accident? “Stay indoors and await further instructions,” read the sickly green letters on the television screen. As Nick’s anxious mother, pregnant sister and doltish brother-in-law bicker and fuss, his father (Grant Masters) takes charge, insisting that the television’s increasingly sinister and divisive dictates be followed exactly. But when suspiciously unsterile “vaccination kits” drop down the chimney like ominous Christmas gifts, Nick and Annji rebel. Harnessing the rhythms of the sitcom and the tropes of the season — there’s even a pitch-black evocation of the Nativity — Mr. Kevorkian casts a wide social-satire net, massaging the link between generational abuse and blind obedience to authority. Horror derives as much from the narrowness of his characters’ minds as the Cronenbergian mortifications of their flesh, creating an all-too-plausible nightmare of media’s ability to turn brother against brother. And while most movies of this type simply peter out, “Instructions” maintains such an unswerving commitment to its dark purpose that its final, gorgeously tenebrous images will leave you wobbly for days. An earlier version of this review misspelled the given name of the actress who plays Annji. She is Neerja Naik, not Neera.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Barbara,’ a Fictional Biopic of a French Chanteuse","“Barbara” packs a lot of metatextual baggage. It’s directed by and co-stars Mathieu Amalric; the actress in the title role, sort of, is Jeanne Balibar; Mr. Amalric and Ms. Balibar were once married. The “sort of” is because Ms. Balibar doesn’t play the title role as such. She plays an actress named Brigitte, who’s playing the real-life French singer Monique Serf, who went by the stage name Barbara, in a film directed by Yves, the character played by Mr. Amalric. Barbara, a contemporary of Jacques Brel, was a chanteuse who specialized, as is the French custom, in songs of lost love. She was hugely popular in her country — one of her records is reputed to have sold a million copies in the 12 hours after its release — and all but unknown in the United States. She died in 1997 at 67. I’m making this film sound like a potentially difficult sit. It’s not, at all. Mr. Amalric’s film has a fragmented style, depicting the shooting of various sequences in the fictional Barbara biopic, and some personal excursions of Brigitte’s, including an amorous road trip with a hunky prop man. It’s a film of scenes rather than of one unified narrative, but each scene is a showcase for the magnificent talents of Ms. Balibar, a multifaceted performer of spectacular magnetism and intelligence. Stalking a hotel room wearing only fishnet stockings and a blouse, she’s a cat on the prowl for something she can’t quite put her paw on; sitting at a piano and belting out one of Barbara’s songs, she’s the queen of French soul. Mr. Amalric plays Yves as a still-besotted fan of Barbara, and as a director he’s a still-besotted fan of Ms. Balibar’s. He is wise in his enthusiasms.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Bayou Caviar,’ the Main Course Is a Cold-Blooded Noir","The title “Bayou Caviar” refers to the preferred body disposal method of a Russian gangster (Richard Dreyfuss) in New Orleans, where it’s easy to keep alligators who love a fleshy snack. That disgusting conceit provides a fitting central image for the movie, a cold-blooded noir in which the overarching question is which chumps will become chum, literal or metaphorical. Directed by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his first feature at the helm, “Bayou Caviar” is far from the most elegant example of its genre. Despite seamy, well-chosen locations, Mr. Gooding is way too heavy-handed in his scoring and visual choices. But the movie deserves credit for its untempered nastiness. With one exception, Mr. Gooding refuses to redeem any of his characters, and certainly not the one he plays: Rodney, a former boxing star reduced to working as a bouncer, a job that eventually brings him into contact with Mr. Dreyfuss’s character. Rodney’s task is to provide compromising evidence on the son-in-law of the gangster’s business associate, a blackmail scheme that, executed properly, could redound to the benefit of several people, including a celebrity-hungry teenager (Lia Marie Johnson) and a photographer (Famke Janssen). Thanks to some clever plotting — Mr. Gooding is credited alongside Eitan Gorlin with the script — the lucrative possibilities grow. (A sex tape passed from person to person is instinctively exploited by almost everyone who holds it.) Like a boxer who doesn’t know when to quit, “Bayou Caviar” goes on a bit long, then rallies — in this case with an agreeably cynical closing image.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Beautiful Boy,’ a Writer Confronts His Son’s Meth Addiction","The question that tears at David Sheff, a magazine writer living in Marin County, outside San Francisco, is “Why?” Why did his oldest son, Nic, a charming and thoughtful young man who loved drawing, writing, reading and surfing, slide into drug addiction? It’s something many parents in David’s position ask, even as they despair of a satisfying answer. Nic tells his father that crystal meth filled a void in his life. The first time he consumed it, he says, his world went “from black and white to Technicolor,” and he’s reluctant to go back. More than anything, David wants him back. “Beautiful Boy,” directed by Felix Van Groeningen (“The Broken Circle Breakdown”) is based on paired memoirs by the real David and Nic Sheff, who are played onscreen by Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet. The film tilts a bit more toward the parental perspective, emphasizing David’s pain and bafflement. But it also incorporates some of his son’s literary sensibility, and conveys the bliss of being high along with the desperation of dependency. We don’t really learn why Nic became addicted, but we do get a sense of what it was like for him and his family to struggle with his disease. Stories like this tend to vary in setting and details, but also to conform to a certain pattern. Van Groeningen, who wrote the script with Luke Davies, arranges the narrative in chronological curlicues, looping back and forth in time and relying heavily on extended, music-driven montages. The digressions and flashbacks rest on a familiar sequence: a crisis is followed by an attempt at sobriety and, usually, a relapse. The governing moods are grief, guilt, anxiety and what David calls “psychological terror.” Nic is skilled at lying and emotional manipulation. He cannibalizes love and undermines trust, and allows glimmers of his smart, charming self to peak through at strategic moments. David swerves from denial to guarded optimism to exasperation, veering into rage and despair. His wife, Karen (Maura Tierney), Nic’s stepmother, tries to be supportive. Nic’s mother, Vicki (Amy Ryan), who lives in Los Angeles, does what she can to help, though she and David often find themselves quarreling about what to do and who is at fault. It is hard not to be touched by the testing of paternal love, or by Nic’s fragility. But “Beautiful Boy,” rather than plumbing the hard emotional depths of its subject, skates on a surface of sentiment and gauzy visual beauty. There is a lot of good music — John Lennon, Sigur Ros, Perry Como — and California vistas so gorgeous that you might wonder if the state’s tourist board had a role in the production. (The cinematographer is Ruben Impens.) But the picturesqueness and the flowing, music-video rhythms of the editing give the film a slick, evasive feel, as if it were too cautious or too cool to confront the worst of what it’s about. The main performances are similarly coy, as if the actors were protecting the characters from our scrutiny rather than opening them up. Neither Carell nor Chalamet risks losing the audience’s sympathy, which means that neither one fully earns it. The movie almost defensively insists on propositions we had no reason to doubt. Nic is a good kid. David is a good dad. Meth is a terrible, seductive drug. “Beautiful Boy” is not a bad movie. It was made with earnest care and honorable intentions, and concludes with a recitation of one of Charles Bukowski’s best poems. But as much as it may want to illuminate the realities of addiction, it mystifies David and Nic’s experiences, leaving too many questions — how and what as well as why — swirling in the air.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Boy Erased,’ a Young Man Struggles With Faith and Sexuality","Jared Eamons, an Arkansas college student who is an avid runner and an aspiring writer, is also gay. Or rather, he is in the midst of figuring that out about himself — what it means, how he might act on it — when his panicked parents enroll him in a conversion therapy program designed to change, or at least suppress, his sexuality. “Boy Erased,” adapted by Joel Edgerton from Garrard Conley’s memoir of the same title, is the second film this year to tackle the subject of conversion therapy, a technique that is a mix of religious dogma and dubious science whose cruelty and ineffectiveness have been amply documented. Like “The Miseducation of Cameron Post,” directed by Desiree Akhavan and based on a young-adult novel by Emily Danforth, Edgerton’s film is set in the recent past, but its eye is very much on the present. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have outlawed conversion therapy, which still leaves a lot of young people vulnerable to the kind of treatment Jared undergoes. But “Boy Erased” tries to be more than a simple culture-war morality play, and it succeeds in some measure thanks to Lucas Hedges’s performance as Jared and those of Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe as his parents, Nancy and Marshall Eamons. Marshall, who owns a growing Ford dealership, is also a Baptist minister, a kind and scholarly man who loves his son. So does Nancy, who drops her son off every morning at Love in Action, leaving him in the care — or at the mercy — of its director, Mr. Sykes, played by Edgerton. More directly than her husband, Nancy must struggle to reconcile protective parental instincts with what she sees as the demands of her faith. At first, Jared himself accepts the Love in Action program, which combines the language of the recovery movement with stern Christian morality. His sexuality is defined as a choice and a sin, and he and his fellow “clients” are required to take “moral inventory” of their past behavior, and to participate in role plays, confessions and group discussions. Gradually, these activities, and Mr. Sykes’s way of dealing with his charges, tilts toward psychological and physical abuse. There is also an element of hucksterism to the enterprise, which costs desperate families a lot of money. When Mr. Sykes tries to bully Jared into dropping out of college and moving into one of Love in Action’s group homes, it seems likely that he has Nancy and Marshall’s money as well as their son’s immortal soul in mind. Mr. Sykes serves as a villain, backed up by a handful of sinister minions (notably a menacing former convict played by Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers). But you may also suspect that he is an anguished and conflicted soul in his own right, a suspicion confirmed by an end-credits note about what the real Mr. Sykes is up to now. The mood of “Boy Erased” is not of indictment but of kindness, a virtue that Jared has clearly learned from his mother and father, even if they differ as to its meaning. The film’s sensitivity, though it is an ethical strength, is also a dramatic limitation. “Boy Erased” uses Jared’s story — which includes a high school attempt at heterosexual romance, a horrifying campus sexual assault and a chaste night spent in the bed of another man — primarily as a window into the issues raised by Conley’s book. This is admirable, but what’s missing is a sense of the texture and complication of the Eamons family’s life. Their personalities are too neatly diagramed, their conflicts too emphatically articulated, for “Boy Erased,” moving though it is, to feel like more than a summary of its own noble intentions.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Burning,’ Love Ignites a Divided World","One of the most beautiful scenes in a movie this year — in many years — comes midway through “Burning.” Two men and a woman are lazing around outside a home. They’re in the South Korean countryside, near the border with North Korea, where the squawk of propaganda drifts in and out from loudspeakers. Now, though, in the velvety dusk light, the sound of Miles Davis’s ethereal trumpet fills the air, and the woman begins swaying, taking off her shirt. She is dancing for the men, but mostly she’s dancing in what feels like ecstatic communion between her and the world. Desire, ravenous and ineffable, shudders through “Burning,” the latest from the great South Korean director Lee Chang-dong. Set in the present, the movie involves the complicated, increasingly fraught relationships among three characters whose lives are tragically engulfed as desire gives way to rage. The story has the quality of a mystery thriller — somebody goes missing, somebody else tries to figure out why — one accompanied by the drumbeat of politics. The larger, more agonizing question here, though, involves what it means to live in a divided, profoundly isolating world that relentlessly drives a wedge between the self and others. The story opens the day that a young delivery man, Jongsu (Ah-in Yoo), meets a young woman, Haemi (Jong-seo Jun), in a chaotic, anonymous city. She works as store barker, dancing in scanty clothing while tempting shoppers with raffle prizes. Haemi hails Jongsu and reveals that they know each other from their hometown — he has no memory of her — then blurts out that she’s had plastic surgery. Later, she reminds him that when they were young he once crossed a street to tell her she was ugly, news she casually delivers while searching for a reaction that never comes. Jun gives a physically open, natural performance that works as a lovely counterpoint to Haemi’s cryptic actions — she has an unseen cat, peels an invisible tangerine — while Yoo invests Jongsu with a reserve that suggests social awkwardness that can seem self-interested. (Slack-jawed, Jongsu hunches like a man in retreat or a teenager who hasn’t settled into his adult body.) Despite his seeming indifference to Haemi, he responds to her friendliness, and before long they’re in bed. This nascent intimacy abruptly ends when she leaves on a trip. When she returns with a wealthy enigma, Ben (Steven Yeun), the three form an awkward triangle, a configuration that derails Jongsu. The movie is based on “Barn Burning,” a 1992 short story by Haruki Murakami that throbs with unspoken menace and shares its title with a far more blatantly violent 1939 story by William Faulkner. Lee nods at Faulkner (a favorite author of Jongsu whom Ben begins reading), but takes most of his cues from Murakami’s story. Lee retains its central triangle and some details, while making it his own by, for instance, changing the Miles Davis music. Mostly, Lee slowly foregrounds the uneasy violence that flickers through the Murakami to stunning, devastating effect. Written by Lee and Oh Jung-mi, “Burning” unfolds in realistic scenes that don’t necessarily seem to be advancing a strong theme. Things happen, casually. For the most part, the story follows Jongsu, who’s as closed-down as the door in the movie’s opening image. Seemingly friendless, he says he wants to write. But his father’s legal troubles have forced Jongsu to take over the family’s run-down farm alone. “What kind of ‘writing’ are you going to ‘create,’” his father’s lawyer mockingly asks Jongsu, as if to remind him of his place in life. The lawyer also compares Jongsu’s father to a protagonist in a story, a remark that suggests our stories are written for us. For the lawyer, fiction writing is clearly useless, and it certainly has no instrumental value for Jongsu’s father. That the movie is based on a story by a celebrated writer invests this seemingly uneventful scene with dark comedy, even if the larger point is the question of free will. (Is Jongsu writing his own story, or has it been determined by his father, whose rage landed him in jail?) The movie engages this question more directly once Ben — with his silky smiles and laid-back imperiousness — begins disrupting the equilibrium. “There is no right or wrong,” Ben tells Jongsu, after confessing that he torches derelict greenhouses. “Just the morals of nature.” An understated visual stylist, Lee shoots and edits this scene simply but elegantly, initially cutting between the two men, who are each isolated in the frame. They’re sitting fairly close yet seem worlds apart. It’s the same night as Haemi’s ravishing dance. But now she’s asleep inside, the sun has set, and the men are alone in an exchange that grows darker, figuratively and literally, as Jongsu talks about his unhappy childhood and Ben shares his worldview. As the scene progresses, Lee joins the men visually in two-shots that leave one or the other blurred, only to punctuate this back and forth with an image of them seated side by side like mirrored images. Here and throughout, Lee allows the actors to fill in their characters, letting them add pointillist detail to their portraits rather than smothering them in close-ups or self-regarding directorial virtuosity. All three leads are sensational (Yeun turns yawns and soft laughter into nightmares), giving performances that retain a sense of mystery that dovetails with the movie’s ambiguity. Again, things happen, often casually. Yet while each event expands the narrative — filling in the larger picture with nods at sexual relations, class divisions and a riven people — they don’t necessarily explain what happens or answer the fundamental question that burns through this brilliant movie.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Caniba,’ a Killer Tries to Make His Case","The Roman playwright Terence wrote, “I am human; nothing human is alien to me.” Filmgoers interested in putting this idea to the test will find powerful material in “Caniba,” a new documentary directed by Véréna Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor. The film opens with an extreme close-up of Issei Sagawa, who in 1981, while living in France, killed and cannibalized Renée Hartevelt. After being found insane at his trial and released from charges, he returned to his native Japan. At home, he found celebrity via books and manga about his crime; he also appeared in pornographic movies (explicit clips are shown in the film). Now largely paralytic, he is cared for by his brother Jun, who is also a looming presence. We see Jun later on wrapping his own arm in barbed wire and stabbing at his skin with butcher knives. “Cannibalism is very much nourished by fetishistic desire,” the killer rationalizes at a point early in the movie. But the filmmakers, who are affiliated with Harvard’s Sensory Ethnography Lab, almost aggressively avoid providing any back story or context here. Keeping their subjects in clammy close-up, they do not explain, among other things, why Sagawa, who is about 70 years old, is so debilitated — nor why one of his caretakers is dressed in a maid’s costume. Still, the film’s final images of him, totally dependent on his keepers, achieve a kind of morbid poignancy. The filmmakers, who made “Leviathan,” the striking 2012 immersion into commercial fishing, seem to be arguing that Sagawa needs to be understood beyond moralistic preconceptions. “Caniba” did not make the case for me. I consider Sagawa repellent, and the movie an exercise in intellectualized scab-picking.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Classical Period,’ a Deep Dive — Really Deep — Into Dante","“Classical Period,” the second and (at barely more than an hour) longest feature from the offbeat filmmaker Ted Fendt (“Short Stay”), is technically in English, but it might as well be in liberal-arts-speak. Characters toss off lines like “I’ve never read the Borges book this quote is from” and “It’s actually the most comprehensive book about the freeway revolt in Philadelphia that I’ve read.” Such insights and humblebrags are the bulk of the dialogue. The title evokes the musical era that preceded Romanticism, and this highly original movie has been denatured of romance or even obvious dramatic incident. The film is organized around a group that meets to discuss “The Divine Comedy.” The most enthusiastic participant is Cal (Calvin Engime), who speaks authoritatively on the original Italian and just about everything else. (In the wittiest set piece, a lengthy single take, he delivers a comically off-the-cuff history of the English Reformation martyr Edmund Campion.) “Classical Period” is often very funny, but it’s also poignant, imagining a milieu — part heaven, part purgatory — in which daily lives can be devoted to pondering the aggregated wisdom of the past. There are also hints of a plot, as the seasons progress and Evelyn (Evelyn Emile), another member of the group, expresses irritation at Cal’s smugness. Fendt finds beauty in delicately shaded shots of reading and translating. (The movie was shot on 16-millmeter, and the texture — itself the stuff of libraries and archives — seems essential to the experience.) In looking to the past, “Classical Period” finds something new.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Days of Rage,’ the Revolution Will Be Trivialized","When the playwright Steven Levenson, then a “bored high school junior,” found himself outside the Supreme Court on a December evening in 2000, it was not because of a passionate interest in the case of Bush v. Gore then being decided or a fondness for demonstrations. “The truth is I had never been to a protest,” he wrote last year in an essay about political engagement. “And it sounded like a good story to tell at school on Monday.” In some ways, Mr. Levenson’s disappointing play “Days of Rage,” which opened on Tuesday at Second Stage Theater, is that good story, except turned inside out. In this version, callowness has curdled into cynicism, and it isn’t naïveté being mocked. Instead, young radicals who believe themselves to be fighting injustice are shown to be fools — and worse. A peaceful march is not what the play’s characters, affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, are after. Disappointed by years of unsuccessful agitation against the war in Vietnam, the three remaining members of a ragtag collective in an upstate New York town a lot like Ithaca are ready for revolution. As the action begins in October 1969, Jenny (Lauren Patten), Spence (Mike Faist) and Quinn (Odessa Young) are hoping to convince hundreds of locals to join them in Chicago for the “Days of Rage” action organized by the Weatherman cadre then taking over the leadership of the S.D.S. After weeks of leafleting they have five people signed up. Including themselves. Their failure as organizers puts a strain on the household, which is run with strict collectivist principles. All decisions are made by majority vote. All behavior is subject to quasi-sadistic group criticism sessions. All money is shared. Bodies are shared too, supposedly to prevent individual attachments from undermining the mission. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] Cutting against this discipline is the chaos of 20-somethings living in a hovel. (Louisa Thompson’s set, a cross-section of a house barely managing to stand, is completely convincing on that score.) Quinn, the truest believer, accuses Jenny of not cleaning the pantry. Spence, who fancies himself the theorist, has doubts about Jenny’s doctrinal (or, at any rate, sexual) devotion. And with little more than $50 among them, paying the rent may be a more pressing issue than supporting the Vietcong. So far so good; the ineptitude and jumbled motives of agitators — ego, angst and anomie come into it — are reasonably ripe for satire. And though the failures of radicalism are a common enough theme of fiction (“American Pastoral”), film (“Running on Empty”) and earlier plays (“Other Desert Cities”), “Days of Rage” renews the genre merely by asking how far we would go to stand up to a government we consider bereft of values. On Saturday night, just a few hours after the murder of 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, the gasp of the audience when a character brought out a gun seemed more than just a response to a plot turn. But with the introduction of two outsiders, the play starts tugging in incompatible directions. Peggy (Tavi Gevinson) is a rich runaway whose willingness to join the collective and cover its bills comes with a big problem attached. She’s a troublemaker, pushing the others into paranoiac corners and the play into overdrive. Whenever she’s in a scene, it becomes more about individual psychopathology than group dynamics, and not very credible in either case. Hal (J. Alphonse Nicholson) pushes the other way. He is black, has a brother in Vietnam and has already experienced the injustices the others blather about. Their condescension to him and his bemused response are the most interesting things in the play; when Jenny confesses she is a racist, “like everyone in the country,” what can Hal answer but “great”? Mr. Levenson excels at overall dramatic architecture; as in “If I Forget” and his book for “Dear Evan Hansen,” the timing and payoff of plot points here is unimpeachable. But the clash between heavy-handed satire and naturalistic conflict leaves “Days of Rage” in a tonal muddle he can’t resolve. The sexual turn that provides closure to many of the scenes quickly begins to seem like a tic, and when that pales, the only option left is a generalized hysteria. At least the hysteria is effectively staged. The director Trip Cullman gets all the tempos right, forcing the audience into an uncomfortable alliance with the characters as they hole up in their hovel, certain they are about to be attacked. And the cast — especially Ms. Patten, lately seen in “Jagged Little Pill,” and Mr. Nicholson, riveting in “Paradise Blue” — does a good job filling their shells of characters with genuine personality. Ms. Gevinson’s breathy, bug-eyed weirdness, so distracting in other roles, is surprisingly effective here. If only she weren’t playing such a worm and a dilettante. To the extent “Days of Rage” focuses on Peggy — she sets the plot in motion — it seems to suggest that the entire antiwar movement, or at least its radical fringe, was an adolescent tantrum, with no intellectual heft however much Hegel was read. (Peggy at first thinks Lenin is a Beatle.) Certainly many did things during that period they needed to regret; some have spent the last five decades explaining and paying for their behavior. In “Days of Rage,” a somewhat lame “what happened to them” coda tots up the costs and the accommodations of the characters’ bad choices. But in the bigger scheme of things, the radicals were not the problem. They were the ones who were willing to reopen the question of how America should function — to say, as Jenny does in one of the play’s best moments, “Once you know what’s happening in the world, in your name, all over the world, then the only extreme thing really is to do nothing.” Foolish they may have been: paranoid, grandiose and rigid in their thinking. But who does that sound like today? This information was last updated on Oct. 1, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Don’t Go,’ Will a Dad’s Dreams Change Reality?","As an actor, Stephen Dorff possesses an elusive, languorous quality that can make even a run-of-the-mill popcorn flick light up with mystery. In the otherwise middling thriller “Don’t Go,” Dorff is strikingly enigmatic in his role as Ben, an acclaimed writer remaking his life as a schoolteacher in Ireland with his wife, Hazel (Melissa George), after the sudden death of their young daughter. While Hazel establishes roots, starting a new hotel business, Ben is drawn away from reality by the vivid hold of his dreams. Night after night, Ben returns to the same picturesque memory of his family spending time on the beach, planting sandwich flags in sand castles. Each morning, he wakes with a flag from his daughter in hand, materialized from nothing. To the horror of his wife, who was just finding her footing after their loss, Ben becomes convinced that by changing his dreams, he might also change his daughter’s fate. As Ben disengages, Dorff’s disarming, laid-back presence draws attention to the character’s ambiguity — he is both a father understandably disturbed by grief and a husband failing to support his wife. The director David Gleeson bridges the gap between reality and dreaming by keeping the visual realm of Ben’s subconscious relatively mundane while his regular life is prone to dramatic lighting and spectacular scenery. But the gimmick that propels the action undercuts the characters. If Ben can change his past, it becomes challenging to take interest in his present. It falls on the performances to add subtle touches to the narrative’s broad strokes. George is admirably warm as the earthbound Hazel, and Dorff suggests the selfishness of his character’s selfless desperation.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Evolution of Mann,’ Fumbling Cuteness Goes Only So Far","Henry Mann has had a bad year: He has been to 12 weddings. You’d think he would wise up after four or five, but no: It’s when he receives a 13th invite — from his ex-girlfriend, no less — that he decides it’s time to find his soul mate. No way is he attending this particular shindig as a single man. But before this happens our hero (Max Crumm) has some growing up to do in “The Evolution of Mann,” the cliché-ridden new musical by Douglas J. Cohen and Dan Elish at the Cell Theater. Henry’s biggest challenge involves deciding who is meant for him: a shy, quirky colleague or a preening narcissist. Common sense dictates the answer, but musicals, and love, don’t run on common sense. Still, watching a handful of romantic comedies for guidance would have saved a lot of anguish. Henry and Gwen (Leslie Hiatt), his friend, roommate and colleague, are both in the doldrums. A would-be performance artist, she is separated from her wife and playing the field, or at least she works hard to look like she is. As for Henry, he’s an aspiring writer of both musicals and children’s poetry, and finds refuge in passive-aggression masked as fumbling cuteness. This nice guy is picky, too: His main objection to the adorably nerdy Christine (Allie Trimm, of “13” and the 2009 revival of “Bye Bye Birdie”) is that she has a unibrow. Harsh, from a man who at one point wears a yellow beret to look bohemian and impress his new girlfriend, Tamar (Ms. Trimm again). That she is bad news is telegraphed by her working in public relations. Has a member of that profession ever been anything but manipulative and superficial in a rom-com? She cannot possibly be a good influence on Henry, and even talks him into going back to work on his long-neglected (for a reason) musical adaptation of “The Great Gatsby.” “She’s my own Daisy Buchanan/But she’ll never let a man like Henry Mann in,” he sings despondently after meeting Tamar. Alas for his sake, she does. Alas for the audience’s sake, there are plenty more such rhymes. Mr. Elish (“13”) collaborated on the lyrics with Mr. Cohen, who composed the bland tunes that never test the cast, but he bears sole responsibility for the book, based on his own 2005 novel, “Nine Wives.” In addition to the aforementioned dilemma between an obvious good choice and an obvious bad choice, Mr. Elish also keeps bringing up potentially fun plot points, only to drop them. Not enough is made, for instance, of the terrible “Gatsby” musical Henry and Tamar commit, or of Gwen’s forays into performance art (she is like a defanged version of Maureen from “Rent”). The show, directed by Joe Barros, does find time for “Hard,” in which Henry gets an unfortunate erection while slow dancing with Christine. “Do I pretend it’s there at all,” she sings. “What is the protocol? The situation’s hard.” To their credit, Ms. Trimm and Mr. Crumm — who is much better playing a bumbling lover than he was as the swaggering Danny Zuko in Kathleen Marshall’s 2007 revival of “Grease” — display as much charm in this number as is humanly possible.

2018,"Review: In ‘Fireflies,’ the Preacher’s Wife Gets Her Say","Like Lincoln, and for similar reasons, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has become more than an actual historical human: He’s a cultural touchstone. We are used to seeing that civil rights leader, or his pseudonymous stand-ins, fictionalized and anatomized in plays like “The Mountaintop” by Katori Hall, “The Good Negro” by Tracey Scott Wilson and “The Man in Room 306” by Craig Alan Edwards. But we haven’t seen much onstage about Coretta. In “Fireflies,” which opened on Monday at the Atlantic Theater Company, the playwright Donja R. Love daringly sets out to correct that, subverting the standard portrait of a great-man marriage by making the wife infinitely more interesting than the husband. Though the Martin figure is called the Rev. Charles Emmanuel Grace, there is no mistaking his “face of the movement” stature for anyone else’s. As the play begins, Charles (Khris Davis) has been called upon, just as King was, to speak at the funeral of the black girls killed in the Birmingham, Ala., church bombing in September 1963. But in Mr. Love’s fantasia, it is the reverend’s wife, Olivia, a pencil always handy in her hairdo, who writes the words that soar and console. We meet the two characters at a fraught moment — probably an over-fraught one, dramatically. Olivia (DeWanda Wise) is pregnant with the couple’s first child but is reluctant to become a mother. One reason is that she is subject to dreams and surreal visions that today might be seen as symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Bombs explode around her, and thousands of fireflies swarm the sky, representing murdered black children “flying home” to God. Why add to their number? Also contributing to the pressurized situation is a package Olivia has just received from the F.B.I. enclosing tape recordings and a machine on which to play them. For Olivia no less than Mrs. King, whose real-life F.B.I. encounter was dramatized in the movie “Selma,” the tapes provide evidence of her husband’s infidelity. Yet all this is still only a small part of Mr. Love’s complicated picture of Olivia, whose sublimation of self sometimes reminded me of women in plays by William Inge, but with an even deeper secret inflecting her actions. Perhaps it will not spoil too much to note that “Fireflies” is the second play in a trilogy that Mr. Love describes as an exploration of queer love through black history. The first, “Sugar in Our Wounds,” concerns the romance between two male slaves; the third, “In the Middle,” takes place against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement. Unearthing the role of gay black people in American history is a crucial proposition. (Among the distressingly few such plays is “Blueprints to Freedom,” about Bayard Rustin.) I was moved by Mr. Love’s willingness to imagine, amid the terror of the times and also the shipshape domesticity of the Grace kitchen as rendered in Arnulfo Maldonado’s set design, other kinds of lives than the ones that history books offer. And as embodied by the fine performers here, under the direction of Saheem Ali, those lives really do seem alive. Ms. Wise, best known as Nola Darling in the Netflix reboot of “She’s Gotta Have It,” unifies Olivia’s deeply divided character so that you track your empathy for her even when she slides from apparent giddiness to Medea-like rage. And Mr. Davis, exhilarating onstage in “The Royale” and heartbreaking in “Sweat,” is both of those here, layering one beneath the other to deepen our understanding of a fallible man of faith. But every time the play began to engage me through character it disengaged me through plot contrivance. Secret letters, unscrupulous doctors and kitchen knives come into it. What the actors can overcome, the story often cannot, and the pileup of life-shattering events all in the course of two days begins to seem less like dramatic compression than old-fashioned overkill. The language, too, can seem awfully rich, perhaps deliberately in a play about oratory and faith. (We hear parts of three sermons.) It is one of the more fascinating aspects of “Fireflies” that Mr. Love, who says he became a playwright after realizing that acting wasn’t a part of his “ministry,” makes the rhetoric of the black church into a kind of third character in this two-hander. He — or, more likely, she, the play argues — steals the show. This information was last updated on Sept. 26, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Galveston,’ on the Run With Nowhere to Go","With shadowy imagery that pushes the boundaries of visibility and a mumbly lead performance from Ben Foster that strains the limits of intelligibility, “Galveston” goes past film noir and lands at film murk. Fans of “True Detective,” whose creator, Nic Pizzolatto, wrote the novel on which this movie is based, won’t be surprised to see a routine on-the-lam scenario treated with the solemnity of the Oresteia. But the heavy-handed filmmaking is more of a mystery coming from the actress Mélanie Laurent, who directed the elegant “Breathe” (2015). Foster is Roy, a criminal in New Orleans with a fondness for drink (more mumbling) and a lung ailment that’s probably going to kill him, or at least give him license to make decisions a man with a future wouldn’t. Set up by his boss (Beau Bridges), he escapes being shot and drives off with a 19-year-old, Raquel (Elle Fanning), he finds tied to a chair at the scene. En route to nowhere in particular, they pick up a young girl at Raquel’s home and hole up at a motel, whose manager (C.K. McFarland) is immediately suspicious. The grimy ambience and a few winning moments with the actors buy the movie some time before an inevitably violent climax, although much of that good will is squandered in a showy suspense sequence that appears to unfold in a single take. (The “shot” has probably been stitched together, but either way, it serves the crew members’ C.V.s more than the story.) The epilogue reaches for a gravitas the material simply doesn’t earn.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Lewiston/Clarkston,’ America at a Crossroads (Plus Dinner)","Critic’s Pick It’s only fitting that Rattlestick Playwrights Theater would gut its Greenwich Village home to accommodate the unconventional production of “Lewiston/Clarkston” that opened there on Thursday. The 24-year-old company merely did for Samuel D. Hunter’s new play what the play will do to you. Make that “plays.” “Lewiston” and “Clarkston,” though thematically intertwined, are stand-alone 90-minute works, here produced in one evening that includes a sit-down dinner during the half-hour intermission. You can bring your own meal, or reserve a catered one with your ticket, but either way you’ll need the break — not so much to recover from “Lewiston,” which is lovely but mild, as to prepare for “Clarkston,” which is devastating. Each play involves an indirect descendant of one of the title cities’ namesakes: Meriwether Lewis and William Clark of the landmark expedition that began in 1804. In “Lewiston,” set on the Idaho side of the Snake River border with Washington, Marnie, a 24-year-old who cites Lewis as an ancestor, returns from Seattle to homestead the land on which she and her forebears were raised. But most of that land, Marnie learns to her horror, has already been sold to a developer building a condo subdivision called Meriwether Terrace. On the sliver that remains, Alice, a flinty woman in her 70s, scrapes by selling dusty novelty fireworks from a roadside table draped in ratty flag bunting. Connor, Alice’s 50-ish gay roommate, chips in with wages from his job at the local Walgreens. Only the fireworks table is depicted literally in Dane Laffrey’s minimal set, which for “Lewiston” consists of a rectangle of gray industrial carpet surrounded on three sides by audience. (There are 51 seats.) When Marnie pitches a tent in a corner, she is so close you may have to shift your feet, and when Alice detonates a contraband M-80 firework, you’ll definitely recoil. Davis McCallum’s beautifully calibrated staging is so intimate it seems to implicate you in its themes. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] That intimacy, enhanced by Fitz Patton’s wonderfully lush sound design, compensates to some degree for a slightly abstract quality in “Lewiston.” Though the characters are drawn with Mr. Hunter’s typical sympathy and modesty, they seem more like chessmen being pushed around a board than the characters who populate his previous Idaho plays, including “The Whale,” “Pocatello” and “The Harvest.” Marnie (Leah Karpel) is insufferable even when you learn what her big beef is; Alice (Kristin Griffith) is so tough that her eventual softening is anticlimactic. Only Connor (Arnie Burton) is specific enough — and sufficiently independent of the playwright’s manipulation — to be touching. But he’s peripheral to the drama. At the center of that drama is a ghost: Marnie’s dead mother, whom we hear in a series of tape recordings made years earlier as she retraced, on foot, 1,200 miles of the Lewis and Clark trail. It may be lifelike that the absent woman exerts so much pull on both Marnie and Alice, who have more in common than at first appears; people are always wrestling with the past. But it leaves “Lewiston” to amble at a hiker’s fixed pace over essentially flat terrain. Still, if the play’s characters suffer from inertia, its themes gather beautifully and stick to the ribs. So did the barbecue chicken and potato salad I ordered for dinner; I can’t speak for the tofu served with shaved brussels sprout salad that is also available. Questions of American restlessness and rootlessness may gnaw at you while chatting with fellow audience members at the communal tables. Learning where we all came from, I found myself wondering whether our frequent and sometimes violent relocations reflect an atavistic impulse to explore or a more personal need to escape. That turns out to be a ripe way to enter “Clarkston,” set mostly in a Costco on the Washington side of the river. There, Chris, a robust local, is showing Jake, an indirect descendant of William Clark, how to do the job of a late-shift stock boy. They carry giant jugs of cheese puffs and popcorn from pallets at one end of the space, now reconfigured as a rectangle with the audience on the two long sides, to display shelves at the other. Is this, the play asks, what’s left of the wild frontier? If so, Chris (Edmund Donovan) doesn’t seem to mind. A deceptively unsophisticated type, with a blond brush cut, he has never lived anywhere beyond the twin cities and has never seen an ocean. On the other hand, frail Jake (Noah Robbins) majored in postcolonial gender studies at Bennington. Like Marnie in “Lewiston,” he has retraced an ancestor’s path from the country’s periphery to its mountain interior in hopes of finding something to belong to. That he does not already feel that kind of belonging is not because he is gay, nor because he has Huntington’s disease and may not survive a decade. It’s more profound than identity or even death. He senses but cannot understand how privilege and intelligence have somehow, in him — and, the play implies, in the country as a whole — festered into confusion and anomie. Despite that, he develops an intense relationship with Chris, full of switchbacks and mortifications. Some of the mortifications are the kind that result when two people who may not be ideally suited to each other have a great need and few options. Others are familial. When Chris’s volatile mother, Trisha, shows up, a tragic vein in the story is opened, with the heartbreaking Mr. Donovan at its surprising center. You may recognize Trisha subliminally; she is played by Heidi Armbruster, who provided the voice of Marnie’s unstable mother in “Lewiston.” There are many such pointers in each play toward the other: Marnie and Jake both pitch tents — Jake badly; both plays include scenes that take place, somewhat baldly, on the Fourth of July. Unemployment, the closet and drug addiction are afflictions in common. But “Clarkston” is the richer drama, with themes that are more tightly bound to characters and a plot both surprising and inevitable. Its perfect ending — for the first time using the space that was once Rattlestick’s stage platform — feels like a kind of apotheosis, or at least a small reward. Indeed, Mr. Hunter’s golden diptych, no less than Mr. McCallum’s spectacularly unspectacular production, suggests that small rewards may be the only kind available.

2018,"Review: In ‘Liyana,’ Swaziland Orphans Turn Hardship Into a Folk Tale","By addressing strife in Africa in a roundabout way, “Liyana” breaks free of the heaviness that can weigh down an issue-based documentary. The movie, directed by Aaron and Amanda Kopp, follows a group of orphans at a home in Swaziland as they take part in a storytelling workshop. With the workshop leader, the writer and performer Gcina Mhlophe, focusing their instincts, the children devise a folk tale about a girl named Liyana who sets off, with a friendly bull, to rescue her brothers from thieves who have abducted and plan to sell them. In addition to crocodiles, hyenas and a monster, many of the real-life hardships the children have witnessed or experienced — hunger, the prospect of trafficking, parental abuse and deaths from AIDS — work their way into the tale, presented in strikingly rendered animation from Shofela Coker, a Nigerian artist based in San Diego. “Liyana” crosscuts between the children telling the story and the otherwise-wordless animated sequences, which are more like illustrations in motion — brightly hued and textured, with the camera sometimes the only source of movement. “Liyana” includes warm scenes of Mhlophe’s class brainstorming, drawing and painting. The movie also shows the children going about their lives apart from the workshop. (We sit with one boy as he awaits the results of an H.I.V. test.) There are ways in which “Liyana” might seem to put too rosy a spin on its subject matter, but it shows the optimism and self-awareness that can come from creativity.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘London Fields,’ Sex, Apocalypse and Writer’s Block","“London Fields,” directed by Matthew Cullen and adapted from Martin Amis’s 1989 novel, is, quite simply, horrendous — a trashy, tortured misfire from beginning to end. In limbo for years because of a number of legal disputes, this laboriously bizarre picture is narrated by Samson Young (Billy Bob Thornton, drained and dispirited), a dying, creatively stalled American writer who has swapped apartments with a celebrated British author (Jason Isaacs). “There was no book without the girl,” Samson intones as his mysteriously mourning muse, Nicola Six (Amber Heard), appears in black veil and a cloud of pheromones. The year is 1999 and some kind of worldwide catastrophe is unfolding, but Nicola’s main problems seem to be a lack of outerwear and the ability to foresee her own murder. Whether her lover-cum-killer will be the besotted banker (Theo James), the cretinous criminal (an odiously mouth-breathing Jim Sturgess), or Samson himself is a riddle we could not possibly be less interested in solving. The arrival of Johnny Depp as a ludicrously dressed gangster with an entourage of weirdos does nothing to reverse that position. (It does, however, signal that the movie’s costume designer was having much more fun than any of its stars.) Failing to even glancingly approximate the book’s trippy energy or linguistic dazzle, Cullen ricochets between Heard’s slow-motion, perfume-ad close-ups and lurid, comic-book noir. The result is alienating and bogus, as senseless as the image of Nicola’s floating, diaphanous panties. “I’m pretty worried that the critics are going to call you a male fantasy figure,” Samson frets.

2018,"Review: In ‘Ordinary Days,’ a Sweet Escape to the Recent Past","Every time I think about “Ordinary Days,” Adam Gwon’s chamber musical about four New Yorkers longing for meaningful connection, Stephen Sondheim’s song “Another Hundred People” starts playing in my head. That’s not for any deficit in Mr. Gwon’s lovely score. It’s because his show, filled as it is with hope and humor and desolation, evokes what Mr. Sondheim’s lyric calls “a city of strangers” — and because Keen Company’s current revival Off Broadway is powered by the gorgeous performances of two young unknowns. Isn’t a chance to show their stuff, in a place where someone will notice, the reason another hundred people are forever getting off of the bus? Directed by Jonathan Silverstein in the Clurman Theater at Theater Row, with a three-piece band directed by John Bell, “Ordinary Days” is a sweet escape back to 2007. It’s a relief to spend a little time in a moment when New Yorkers had the luxury of everyday angst. Three of the characters here surely do: Warren (Kyle Sherman), a 20-something naïf who hands out fliers on the street and has no idea what to do with his life; Deb (Sarah Lynn Marion), a comically grumpy graduate student in search of a sense of calm; and Jason (Marc delaCruz), a man in his 30s whose solitude looks to be coming to an end. As he says, moving in with his girlfriend, Claire, “You really don’t want to do New York alone.” But Claire (Whitney Bashor) has a deep-seated grief that Jason knows nothing about. It comes between them, but a problem of this lopsided production is that their relationship doesn’t seem worth rooting for. With their lack of chemistry, breaking up seems the wise course. And while Ms. Bashor does a beautiful job with her big number, the haunted “I’ll Be Here,” Claire and Jason never come fully to life. The other love story, though, is delightful to watch. It’s the romance of new friendship between Deb and Warren, which blossoms despite her standoffish resistance. Even before they meet, Ms. Marion (in her New York stage debut) and Mr. Sherman make these two refugees from the Island of Misfit Toys achingly endearing. Warren, in a bright, color-block wardrobe that would look at home on a preschooler (costumes are by Jennifer Paar), is so earnest and unsophisticated — like Kenneth the Page from “30 Rock,” but without the creepiness — that you worry for him. Won’t the city squash him flat? Deb, too, is more banged up than she wants the world to know, and anger is her shield. “I am not a negative person,” she insists in her first song, but we already know she is; that’s part of her aggressive, malcontent charm. When she loses the book containing her thesis research, Warren finds it and becomes convinced that they are destined to be friends. “I sensed from your notebook your fiery nature,” he sings. “Your penmanship crackles with rage.” Meaning it as a compliment, he’s too smitten to grasp how invasive he’s been. But he sees Deb for who she is, and eventually she’ll come around. He is, after all, offering what each of these characters yearns for — to be cherished by someone in this big, lonely city, so that they don’t have to do New York alone.

2018,"Review: In ‘Place,’ a Composer Questions His Comfort, and Power","The drive for redemption has inspired much of Western music. But what might redemption mean to a contemporary American composer sensitized to social injustice? On Thursday, at the Harvey Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the composer Ted Hearne orchestrated the redemption of a white millennial from Fort Greene neighborhood worried about his role in its gentrification. At the end of his 80-minute work “Place,” for singers and onstage chamber ensemble, Mr. Hearne stepped away from the conductor’s spot and took up a protester’s placard. The lights went out on him raising the blank sign, his feet firmly planted at center stage. Politics have been in the foreground of Mr. Hearne’s music before. He has taken on subjects including WikiLeaks, sexual consent and President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Produced by Beth Morrison Projects and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, “Place” is billed as a meditation on gentrification and wider issues of privilege and inequality. But it’s also a show about artistic ego. What saves it from devolving into a woke man’s soliloquy, set in the key of pandering, is that the composer gazes at himself with acerbic detachment. Mr. Hearne had help. The first part of the libretto is made up of a collage of his own writings and others’, such as a breakup letter mixed in with fragments of James Baldwin. In the second part, the poet and spoken word artist Saul Williams provided caustic, needling lines that underpin the remainder of the show as its perspective shifts from the personal to the social. Mr. Hearne and Mr. Williams joined forces with the director Patricia McGregor who, with the set designers Tim Brown and Sanford Biggers, created a multitiered staging. This highlighted the vectors of urban change and displacement pushing outward from the protagonist’s home — a cubicle, really — at the center. “Place” takes shape in songs that emerge like a graffiti mural as repetitive gestures gradually bloom into vibrant, brash statements in high-volume color. The six singers bring with them deep familiarity with diverse vocal styles; the sole white male, Steven Bradshaw, resembles and represents Mr. Hearne. The real Mr. Hearne, a few feet away, leads the 18-strong ensemble from a conductor’s area kitted out with a keyboard and console that allow him to electronically distort elements of the sound. Singer Ted undergoes a process of learning — or at least exposure — as the protective walls of his home fall away and he hears voices that challenge his cozy complacency. But sly little touches show that it’s Composer Ted who’s on the hook. During “A Thought,” the singer Ayanna Woods hurls the word “migration” into Mr. Hearne’s face and briefly seizes control of his keyboard. In “Maps (Appropriation),” we see Singer Ted at his keyboard groove to an R&B chorus on scaffolding above. When he grabs one musical fragment and samples it digitally, the singers fall silent and look down aghast. And for a moment, the composer and his alter ego face off directly. Who is in control? Then Singer Ted takes charge, tapping out a rhythm on a glass bottle. Eventually the fictional Mr. Hearne leaves the stage, giving space to impassioned statements from the other singers. Sol Ruiz was a haunting presence, her sharp-edged voice equal parts harangue and pain. Josephine Lee brought a sensuous, bluesy tone to her numbers; Isaiah Robinson performed with church-burning intensity. But it was impossible to ignore the presence of the real Mr. Hearne at his command post conducting the musicians, manipulating the sound and driving the pace of a social auto-da-fé of his own orchestration. His score is stylistically diverse, with a sophisticated weirdness to the color palette. The odd bowed cymbal or greedily gurgling contrabass clarinet prevented things from getting too fun in jazzed-up numbers. It always felt as if Mr. Hearne was questioning his own comfort and — in the final moment — his power.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Shirkers,’ Stolen Footage and Dashed Dreams","“Shirkers” is the director Sandi Tan’s first feature — the first, at least, that anyone has been allowed to see. Back in 1992, as a rebellious 19-year-old in Singapore, she wrote and starred in a subversive road movie about a female assassin, enlisting her closest friends, Jasmine Ng and Sophie Siddique, to help with editing and production. The completed project, captured on 70 canisters of donated 16-millimeter film, was then relinquished to its director: a slippery, middle-aged American film teacher named Georges Cardona. They never saw him again. Like a photograph slowly developing before our eyes, “Shirkers” (which was also the title of the original picture) is both mystery and manhunt, a captivating account of shattered friendship and betrayed trust. The skill of the editing (by Tan and two colleagues), though, is key: interviews are woven organically throughout the narrative, and little nuggets of rewarding information are withheld until the final stretches. In this way, the movie is constantly surprising and delighting us, not least in its creative use of the original film’s footage. Those long-lost images, miraculously recovered by Tan two decades after their disappearance, would send her on a quest to reconnect with her former collaborators and make sense of her past. The result is a strange, warm and winding tale of movie love and knifing disappointment, nudged along by Tan’s soft and pleasant narration. An oddly intense teenager with a widely read zine and a variety of international pen pals, she chafed against a rigidly conservative government that banned chewing gum and stifled access to the indie cinema she and her friends craved. When they met Cardona at a filmmaking workshop, he seemed a charismatic kindred spirit, and Tan was intellectually smitten despite the suspicions of her friends. A 40-year-old married man who liked to drive around at night with much younger women, just talking about movies, didn’t seem quite kosher. Those drives would continue after Tan moved to America, including a road trip to New Orleans where Cardona grew up. The relationship might have been platonic, yet it was ardent, giving his treachery the stab of a love gone wrong. This infuses “Shirkers” with a powerful sense of loss, of chances missed and a what-might-have-been tone that isn’t entirely about those stolen canisters. Present-day interviews with Jasmine and Sophie reveal the ingenuity of their contributions and deepen our understanding of the Cardona dynamic, as well as uncover the burrs of disputes that linger in the women’s memories. Somehow, though, the film never sinks into sourness. This is especially surprising as those original clips, shot on the streets of Singapore with a cast of family and friends, are bright and quirky and inventive enough to suggest the possibility of something wonderful and weird: the baby steps of a cult classic. These ghostly, long-ago scenes, artifacts from a painful past, at times turn this new “Shirkers” into an act of exorcism, a purging of regrets and questions that have bedeviled the adult Tan, now a novelist in Los Angeles, for longer than she would like. The love she has for that footage remains inextricably bound up with nostalgia for her younger self, for the dreams of a determined young woman who longed for a bigger world and a wider audience. A shirker, she tells us, is someone who runs away. On the evidence of this movie, Cardona might not have been the only one running.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Six Brandenburg Concertos,’ Diluting Bach’s Dancing Spirit","What is it about Bach that just makes you want to dance — or, at the very least, to run, skip and hop? The music is lush, infectious. It has a beat. You don’t need a partner sweeping you along — the music does it for you. But as Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker showed with her new “The Six Brandenburg Concertos,” her fifth work set to Bach, you have to be fearless enough to ride along with it. Her Bach was diluted and indifferent. Ms. De Keersmaeker, who is based in Brussels, is not alone in her adoration of the composer; other choreographers, over the years, have created masterworks to Bach’s music, including George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, Paul Taylor and Twyla Tharp. For her part, Ms. De Keersmaeker has been listening to “Brandenburg Concertos” for decades. In 1981, while choreographing her classic work “Violin Phase,” set to Steve Reich, it was the only other recording she played. In “Brandenburg Concertos,” Ms. De Keersmaeker starts out simply with the most human of movements: a walk. A leashed white dog — with a charming spot covering one eye and a panting smile — joins in during the horn section. She’s curvy and not really the hunting type, but that makes her presence all the more endearing. It was a cheerful moment in an otherwise arid production that found its pulse intermittently, but rarely with exacting power and flow. The connection between the music and the movement linked instruments to physical expression; but as for drawing out the music’s dancing spirit, the work was increasingly disjointed. As the first concerto filled the vast expanse of the Park Avenue Armory on Monday — the music was performed live by the ensemble B’Rock, under the direction of the violinist Amandine Beyer — 16 dancers walked forward and back, stitching straight lines from the back to the front of the stage and eventually veering into diagonal crossings. Dressed entirely in black, the dancers — like musical notes against a white circular stage and backdrop — wore heels, sneakers and hard-soled shoes; their purposeful strides matched the bass line of the music before their gait dipped with the aid of a trailing back foot. Each new concerto was announced by a man crossing the stage and holding a sign, like a ring girl for classical music, while musicians exited and entered the pit to tune up. But as concerto followed concerto, the dances diminished in size, and the movement lagged at times to the point of lugubriousness. The pauses between concertos didn’t help: Snippets of silent dancing attempted to fill in the space during transitions, but they were too faint and fleeting to keep the momentum going. Throughout this long-winded evening, Ms. De Keersmaeker’s curving pathways had her performers crossing the stage in circles, straight lines and spirals, but they frequently stuttered to a halt. There was a wearying repetition to the vocabulary, which included an assortment of actions that never quite added up: a handstand with a bent knee, a limping walk and — moderately exciting — a hop with a twisting torso. Livelier moments occurred during the finale and in the third concerto, in which a group of men skipped and swirled around the stage, swinging their arms gamely as they bounced forward and back. Yet for all its energy, it was a lighter, less intricate version of “Esplanade,” Mr. Taylor’s revered 1975 modern dance set to Bach based on pedestrian movement — walking, running, jumping and sliding. Here and elsewhere, Ms. De Keersmaeker’s men — 12 in total — dominated the production, yet seldom let go of their inhibitions, which seemed true of “Brandenburg Concertos” as a whole. The dancing trickled behind the music, giving the choreography the sense that it was unfolding in slow motion. It lost its rhythm. An earlier version of this review misstated the gender of the dog in “Brandenburg Concertos.” The dog is a she, not a he. (Her name is Stella.)",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Dark,’ a Traumatized Teenager Becomes a Zombie","The horror film “The Dark” begins queasily, following a man, Josef (Karl Markovics), who has absconded with a blind, bound teenage boy to a cabin deep in a shadowy wood known as Devil’s Den. Josef has monstrous intentions, but he is no match for the forest’s demons. The cabin turns out to be home to an undead, flesh-eating teenager, Mina (Nadia Alexander). She kills Josef, but spares his victim, Alex (Toby Nichols). He has not known death or the taste of human blood, but Mina senses a kindred spirit and his suffering speaks to her own. When search parties come to collect Alex, Mina responds with deadly overprotectiveness. Despite its violence, “The Dark” is quiet in sound and style. The camera frequently hides with Mina in the shadows as she observes intruders who may become her prey. Rather than relying on shocks, “The Dark” takes a sober approach to its realistically gruesome imagery. Mina and Alex are survivors of childhood abuse, and bear the scars of their suffering. Alex’s eyes have been scratched out, while Mina carries wounds from a sexual assault. Her skin is torn and decaying, a grim echo of the acne that might plague an ordinary teenager. This is weighty material for a slim film, and the direction by Justin P. Lange is heavy-handed. Mina and Alex seem less like teenagers and more like case studies with traumas rather than personalities. The horror genre can be a pipeline into the dark corners of the psyche, but the impact of “The Dark” is more clinical than cathartic.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Hate U Give,’ a Police Shooting Forces a Teen to Find Her Voice","The rapper Tupac Shakur once broke down the acronym for his mantra “T.H.U.G. L.I.F.E.”: “The hate you gave little infants [expletive] everybody,” he said of systematic injustices. “What you feed us as seeds, grows and blows up in your face.” More than two decades after his death, his message was worked into “The Hate U Give,” Angie Thomas’s best-selling 2017 novel about a black teenager who experiences those inequalities firsthand. “Pac’s gonna always be relevant,” Khalil (Algee Smith) insists to his childhood friend Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg) in this uneven film adaptation directed by George Tillman Jr. Moments later, Khalil will be dead, shot by a jittery white police officer who pulls them over and mistakes his hairbrush for a gun. The messy thing about relevancy is that sometimes it means not enough has changed for the better. One way to reckon with this fact is through art — which is why, as more black artists have gotten behind the camera and entered the writers’ room, the police brutality narrative has almost become a genre unto itself. Some recent works, like “Queen Sugar,” the TV series created by Ava DuVernay, and Solange Knowles’s 2016 album, “A Seat at the Table,” have been better than others at exploring the psychological toll of that brutality with care and nuance. Mr. Tillman’s “The Hate U Give” (with a screenplay by Audrey Wells) lies somewhere in the middle. The film opens with a powerful affirmation of blackness, both in the beauty of it and the burden. In voice-over, Starr recalls her father, Maverick (Russell Hornsby, excellent), giving “The Talk,” a familiar rite of passage for many black Americans about navigating (and surviving) a predominantly white world, to her younger self and two brothers. He wants to instill in them a sense of pride and the tenets of the Black Panther Party’s Ten-Point Program. As a teenager, Starr is a sneakerhead who uncomfortably straddles opposing worlds — Garden Heights, a predominantly black and lower-income neighborhood, is the place she’s always called home; Williamson Prep, a fancy predominantly white private school, is where she and her siblings, Seven (Lamar Johnson) and Sekani (TJ Wright), attend school. She works hard every day to keep them separate, hiding her white boyfriend, Chris (K.J. Apa), from her father, while policing her own appearance and actions at school. Black vernacular makes her white classmates cool, she observes. “Slang makes me ‘hood.’” Her code switching is the most intriguing story line here, partly because young black female protagonists in popular culture are still few and far between. (A majority of recent films and TV shows starring black characters, like “Insecure” and the “She’s Gotta Have It” TV remake, have focused on 20- and 30-somethings.) Ms. Stenberg strikingly embodies Starr’s dichotomies — self-doubt and bouts of confidence; introversion and outspokenness — but the film’s driving plot is Khalil’s death and how it pushes Starr to come into her own as an activist. Yet the script struggles to effectively weave this all together with the kind of thoughtful complexity that Ms. Thomas brought to her young-adult novel. Mr. Apa’s Chris, for instance, makes for a bland if earnestly supportive boyfriend, and the film glosses over his troublesome recitation of the tired axiom “I don’t see color” when expressing his disappointment with how Starr has kept her connection to the shooting a secret. Elsewhere, the rapper Common has a small role as Starr’s uncle Carlos, a police officer. There’s only a vague understanding of the tension that comes with being in such a position, condensed to a conversation late in the film in which he defends police shootings to Starr by explaining what an officer might be thinking when interacting with a civilian. Thankfully the moment doesn’t end on a #BlueLivesMatter note, though it comes close. But it’s a missed opportunity; after a succinct rebuttal from Starr, the plot pushes on. That’s the other thing about cultural relevancy — if you rely on it too much at the expense of deep characterization, you’ll barely scratch the surface. Ms. Stenberg, Mr. Hornsby and others in the ensemble (including Regina Hall as Starr’s mother, Lisa) are more than capable of exploring their characters’ depths, but a wonky script gets them only so far.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Oath,’ a Pledge of Allegiance to a President Creates Chasms","The premise of “The Oath,” a new satirical comedy written, directed by and starring Ike Barinholtz, is not implausible on its face. In an America of the not too distant future, an unnamed president, in the ostensible name of national security, proposes that citizens sign a “voluntary” oath that begins, “I pledge my loyalty to my president.” Those who opt in will get a nice tax credit, while those who don’t … well, they’re assured that nothing untoward will occur. Mr. Barinholtz’s Chris is married to Tiffany Haddish’s Kai, and they have an adorable daughter around whom they try, and fail, to avoid swearing. They are, in some respects, typical liberals in a typical suburban enclave, or bubble, or what have you. Chris, while outraged over the oath, at first doesn’t see it really catching on in the Land of the Free. Then Thanksgiving weekend rolls around — and with it, the deadline for signing. The pot of opposing opinions is stirred by Chris and reactionary members of his extended family. The script drops right-wing maxims (“facts don’t care about your feelings”) and does a lot of digital-age box-checking (Twitter followers and Instagram feeds are mentioned). Things turn dark and irrevocably ham-handed when a couple of men from an oath-supporting citizens group — a kind of paramilitary organization in disguise — show up. A fixture in the worlds of stage and television comedy, Mr. Barinholtz has enough cachet to assemble an excellent cast, although he’s not as canny about using it. Ms. Haddish, for instance, is largely obliged to place her comedic light under wraps to play a peacemaker while the characters around her freak out. It was said by many after the 2016 election that the Trump administration would yield great satirical art. This is not an example of that.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Sentence,’ a Woman Gets Prison, Her Family Also Pays","You should add five minutes to the actual running time of “The Sentence.” That’s about how long you’ll need to mop up your tears at the end of this emotional documentary. Its maker surely knows — even if you realize his film has several shortcomings, those tears will need to be dried just the same. In 2002, Cindy Shank was living with her boyfriend, who dealt drugs and was shot and killed outside their Michigan home. Police arrived and found a stockpile of cocaine inside. Cindy was released by the authorities and soon began a different kind of life: She married another man, Adam, and had three daughters. Some six years later, Cindy was arrested, tried and convicted on conspiracy charges from that 2002 drug find. Under minimum sentencing laws, she was given 15 years in prison. The director Rudy Valdez, who is also her brother, worked on appeals and clemency petitions. He also taped hundreds of hours of video of her children, so she could have some record of their childhood. That footage makes up the bulk of “The Sentence.” To watch the girls growing older without their mother is devastating, as is the pain in the faces of Cindy’s parents when she occasionally calls home, where the family (and viewers) listen via speakerphone. The emotions run still deeper at the end, when some surprises unfold. As a family member, Valdez had rare access to those he filmed. But that closeness often leads him to omit or skim over vital details — particulars of the crime are frustratingly scarce, as are specifics on the sentencing laws that are denounced here. Those oversights are significant. Yet by making you feel deeply for his sister and her children, Valdez has fashioned his film to make the lapses less glaring.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Waldheim Waltz,’ a Nation Reckons With Its Nazi Past","What does it take to make a nation reconsider its self-image? That’s the question lying at the heart of the Austrian documentarian Ruth Beckermann’s informative and unnerving “The Waldheim Waltz.” Using mostly contemporaneous material — TV reports and news conferences, as well as documentary video footage she shot herself — the filmmaker follows the controversial 1986 presidential campaign of the Austrian politician Kurt Waldheim, whose candidacy was plunged into chaos by new revelations regarding his Nazi past. Waldheim had portrayed himself as an honest soldier who had been conscripted into the Wehrmacht during World War II and returned home in 1941 after getting wounded on the Eastern front. While rumors of further Nazi association had bubbled during his term as United Nations secretary general from 1972 to 1981, it wasn’t until Waldheim sought higher domestic office that more damning evidence emerged — particularly of his involvement in the 1942 massacre of Yugoslav partisans in Kozara and the 1943 deportation of Jews from Salonika, the historical name for Thessaloniki, Greece. The candidate claimed he was the victim of an international conspiracy — by American politicians, the World Jewish Congress and others. As unsettling footage Beckermann herself shot at the time proves, many voters not only sided with him, but went even further, openly spouting anti-Semitic vitriol. The director views Waldheim’s candidacy as a moment when Austria could no longer see itself as an innocent casualty of Nazi rule. The country had often presented itself, we’re told, as “Hitler’s first victim,” and people like Waldheim as honest soldiers caught on the wrong side. The truth, it seems, was a lot more complicated, and disturbing. Beckermann, who narrates, makes no claims to objectivity. She tells us at the outset that she participated in protests against Waldheim. Some of the most fascinating parts of her film show the growth and coalescing of her fellow activists, who became invested in stopping his candidacy. As such, “The Waldheim Waltz” sometimes dances between a brisk, present-tense recounting of political history and a more wandering, personal reflection on the filmmaker’s history. But it leans more toward the political. Beckermann wants not so much to contextualize as to invoke — with the hope, perhaps, that placing us in the middle of this debate will create its own context. Indeed, watching Waldheim’s campaign, it’s hard not to think about the present day — from the emergence of old hatreds, to the closure of elite ranks around their own, to the weaponizing of nationalism against the truth. The film may end in 1986, but the darkness it reveals still looms.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Thunderbodies,’ War, Sheeple and Psychedelic Muumuus","In the “exploded America” of “the medieval Now,” where buffaloes mate with butterflies and give birth to buffalowings, “grotesque” is apparently the latest compliment. I’ll try to bear that in mind. But “Thunderbodies,” a play by Kate Tarker that opened on Saturday at Soho Rep, is so stuffed with cute word twists and tiresome satire it must mean to be grotesque in the old-fashioned way as well. To begin with, the central character is named Grotilde. Having recently “completed her life’s work” of losing either 10 or 610 pounds, she is planning a divorce from the extravagantly medalled Gen. Michail Itterod even though they are not married. Before the grand celebration can start, she wants her son, who was born from her anus, to come home from the war. Ah yes, the war: Where would satire be without one? In this case, America, having defeated a vague enemy in one week, is closing down its military for lack of funds. Peace, a sorry alternative, is declared; the army’s new slogan is “less is more.” If only it were the play’s. At least we can abbreviate the rest of the self-consciously whimsical plot. Disguised as a crab cake, General Itterod (Juan Carlos Hernández) heads off to retrieve Grotilde’s son (Matthew Jeffers). A refugee girl (Monique St. Cyr) gives the son her pocket dictionary and snaps photos of him with a camera made of mud. After being bombarded by fingers, they become engaged: “Together we will be grotesque.” The bonkers president (Ben Horner) drones on while an actual mini-drone hovers over the action. There is so much more, but why should I keep reheating what is evidently not my cup of tea? In terms of alienation, this show had me at “anus.” [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] But even if satire is your thing, you might like it to be funny or pointed. “Thunderbodies” isn’t much of the first or any of the second. Its language is so promiscuous and its object so blurry it seems merely scattershot, as if caught by that mud camera. We can surmise, at least, that Trumpian, triumphalist America is in Ms. Tarker’s cross hairs, even though “Thunderbodies” began in 2014, as a project at the Yale School of Drama. Still, the drone president here is one of the more sympathetic characters. He shouts only occasionally. He is proudly a cat person. That’s not a new species, by the way — though you could be forgiven for thinking so in a play crammed with hybrids and chimeras. Aside from the buffalowings there are sheeple, pop-sickles, swanicles, spring-winter, a wifebed, hawkworms and whamon. (Hint: They’re aquatic.) At the divorce party, a toast is raised to sporks and skorts. These mutant results of unnatural liaisons suggest an Armageddon-like time of social chaos and environmental disaster. (The general woos Grotilde by saying that with all of the earth’s ice melted, “why should our hearts be frozen?”) In one of the few plot threads that bear examination, the soldier and the girl look for a last pure place on earth and, finding it, pollute it. But amid the incessant noise — both aural and visual — of Lileana Blain-Cruz’s production, such moments barely register. This isn’t a problem of managing surrealism; for the Signature Theater, Ms. Blain-Cruz directed a gorgeous revival of “The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World” by Suzan-Lori Parks, a play that would knock “Thunderbodies” out of the ring in a contest of theatrical bewilderment and innovation. Rather, this production seems content to razz and raspberry what can’t be made sense of. (Ms. Tarker studied clowning and commedia dell’arte.) Everything moves at the pace of a frantic party while also desperately signaling subversion. In a kind of overture, even the title, spelled out on placards, is made to dance and wither. You can only take Pee-wee’s Political Playhouse for so long. The violent color scheme of Matt Saunders’s set (banana, fuchsia, aqua) seems to be duking it out with Yi Zhao’s lighting (which includes stroke-triggering strobe effects) for a prize in repellency. And Oana Botez’s costumes aren’t far behind; when we meet Grotilde she is wearing a psychedelic muumuu. At least Grotilde is played by the great Deirdre O’Connell, whose résumé is unparalleled for Off Broadway performances bursting with recognizable human feeling. Not so much here — though I admit it’s a riot, for about a minute, to see her cut loose like a pickled diva on a third-rate talk show. Perhaps you will enjoy her aria about using the general’s nose as a sex toy. Save for the sweet, low-key performance of Ms. St. Cyr as the girl, the rest of the cast is trapped trying to manage the material by steamrollering it. I’m not sure what else they could have done; this is evidently what the playwright, an obviously promising talent, wants. And to its credit, Soho Rep, which is actually in TriBeCa, has never shied from putting its resources behind work — including “Blasted,” “10 out of 12” and “Fairview” — almost certain to be furiously divisive. “Thunderbodies” certainly had me divided — between morbid curiosity and loathing. What you get out of it may be totally different, possibly even grotesque. That must be what Ms. Tarker meant when she said, in a conversation about the play, “Comedy is a darling little Trojan horse.” But surely she means a trorse?

2018,"Review: In ‘Travisville,’ the Rocky Path of Change in a Southern Town","The best path to justice may not be the smoothest one. Even Elder Alden Hearst is starting to get antsy, and he’s long been a calm, dependable intermediary between his African-American community and the white power structure of the Southern city where he lives. “I have spent my entire civic life building political capital,” a frustrated Hearst eventually tells the mayor, Ainsley Gillette. “When do I get to spend it?” This is one among many similar questions in “Travisville,” the playwriting debut by William Jackson Harper, best known for portraying the philosophy professor Chidi Anagonye on the series “The Good Place.” This earnest, oddly flat show takes place in 1964, but its preoccupations have an obvious contemporary resonance: What is the best way to carry out change? When does negotiation turn into collaboration, especially compared to disruptive activism? Mr. Harper’s play, which just opened at Ensemble Studio Theater, revolves around the city’s plan to build a “new indoor/outdoor concept shopping district” — in other words, a mall. Unfortunately for everybody involved, there is already something in the preferred location: a black neighborhood whose residents will need to be relocated, to use a popular euphemism for kicked out of their homes in exchange for a modest sum. As the leader of the local Ministers’ Alliance, a spiritual, civic and de facto political group, Hearst (Brian D. Coats) must deal not just with Mayor Gillette and the developer Jaston Honeycutt (both played by Denny Dale Bess), but also with his fellow pastors. A battle between competing tactics erupts after a young Atlanta college graduate, Zeke Phillips (Sheldon Best, recently seen in “Sugar in Our Wounds”), sits at a white lunch counter and gets arrested. The men of the cloth are unsure of how to deal with both the idealistic Zeke and the looming mall. The Voting Rights Act has recently passed so maybe things will improve on their own, some think. Then again, people are going to lose their houses — maybe progress could use a hard push. These hesitations are given voice by Pastor Ora Fletcher (Bjorn DuPaty), stuck between the impatience manifested by D.L. Gunn (Nathan James), who is ready for Zeke-style confrontation, and Hearst’s accommodating ways. “We will get there,” the older man tells Gunn early on. “We will. But in the meantime, we have to make do with what we have.” Until, of course, that just isn’t enough. To his credit, Mr. Harper does not set up clear-cut dichotomies. Hearst, for instance, isn’t a yes man, and even he loses his sang-froid as the situation takes a tragic turn. The show’s two white characters are not actively hostile — which almost counted as tolerant in the 1960s South — and don’t want to be compared to “them rednecks in Alabama and Mississippi.” (Amusingly, Mr. Bess plays them pretty much the same so the only way to identify who’s who is by his mustache’s angle: down, he’s the mayor; up, the developer.) The cast is compelling and the show well directed by Steve H. Broadnax III, who sets up fluid transitions in and out — characters often enter while those already there are still talking, as if a baton was passed. It is all very neat. Too neat, perhaps: The story feels overly polished in a way that will be familiar to observers of well-crafted contemporary American theater. Mr. Harper has serious writing chops, but if the story of activism has taught us something, it’s that a little mess can be liberating.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Vaya,’ Three Travelers Find Danger in Johannesburg","Probing the space between innocence and experience, the director Akin Omotoso’s fourth feature, “Vaya,” is a story of narrow escapes and even narrower choices. Following three strangers who leave their rural homes and board a train to Johannesburg, the movie slowly and credibly intertwines their fates. All are young, naïve and engaged in deceptively simple errands. Zanele (the lovely Zimkhitha Nyoka) is delivering a young girl to her mother in the city; Nkulu (Sibusiso Msimang) must retrieve the body of his father, a former mine worker, and return it to his grieving family; and Nhlanhla (Sihle Xaba) has been promised a lucrative job by his prosperous cousin, Xolani (a vivid Warren Masemola). What the three encounter, though, is a city filled with large betrayals and dangerous seductions, a place where crime and corruption are rampant and the poor mere tools to be used and abused. Using real experiences shared by the homeless in story workshops, Omotoso — who was also a creator of the South African television series “A Place Called Home” — directs with empathy and without sentimentality. Violence is swift and searing, and the cinematographer Kabelo Thathe’s gorgeous aerial shots and electric street scenes belie the fact that this is his first narrative feature. In the middle of a shootout or on top of a landfill, his camera tells a story that reaches beyond the script. Representative of the millions of South African migrants who have traveled to cities from rural villages, “Vaya” (which means “to go” in Tsotsitaal) illuminates the gulf between those who leave and those who remain. Questioning the very definition of a criminal, the movie abandons our three young searchers in moral transit. After the screen goes dark, we’re still worrying about them.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Venom,’ Tom Hardy as a Weirder-Than-Usual, Not-Quite Superhero","It would be irresponsible of me to recommend that you get to the theater late if you go see “Venom,” a new movie adapted from a Marvel comic book about a kind of divided-self superantihero. By missing the first scene you will be bereft of some ostensibly essential plot material concerning a rocket crash, alien organisms fetched from the East Malaysia scene of said crash, one such alien organism taking over a variety of human bodies, and so on. But if you do in fact enter the theater as the film’s action moves to San Francisco, you will be better able to enjoy “Venom” as a loose remake of the 1981 comedy “Stripes,” with the stalwart actor Tom Hardy in the Bill Murray role. No, seriously, it checks out. Mr. Hardy’s character is a relaxed, near-slovenly but very charming fellow named Eddie Brock who manages to lose his job, his fiancée and his apartment all in the space of a single day, more or less. Are you following me? Here, though, the solution to Eddie’s life challenges lies not in joining the military, but in being joined by an aforementioned alien “symbiote,” one named Venom, who finds Eddie a comfortable fit. When Venom dominates Eddie, he takes on a form that can only be called ridiculously terrifying. Black skin as shiny as patent leather, rheumy eyes the color of spilled milk, tongue an obscenely wriggling raw jumbo hot dog, and the teeth — oh, what teeth he has. Ugly as sin and hungry for human heads, Venom gives Eddie invulnerability against the baddies who pursue him. And Eddie, eventually, gives Venom (who has confided to his host that he’s part of a mission to destroy Earth) a semblance of humanity. In the scenes in which Eddie and Venom get to know each other, so to speak, Mr. Hardy’s outlandishly physical performance bolsters the movie’s not-infrequent flashes of wit. Sometimes “Venom,” directed by Ruben Fleischer, feels like a David Cronenberg body-horror movie (like “Rabid” or “The Fly”) played for slapstick, as when Venom compels Eddie to climb into a lobster tank at a chic restaurant. Michelle Williams plays Anne, Eddie’s estranged fiancée, and for much of the movie she’s just called upon to advance the plot. And to call that plot a conventional Marvel-style contrivance is an understatement. The movie zips to a commonplace climactic set piece, with two admittedly nifty computer-generated monsters battling it out to decide the fate of humankind. You know: for kids! In any event, by this point the movie’s wit has definitively dried up. (The resemblance to “Stripes” is long gone by this time, too.) It takes a while for Ms. Williams’s very-buttoned-up character to actually join the fun, but when she finally and momentarily does — I am reluctant to reveal just how — it’s almost enough to make you want a sequel in which her character has more to do. Emphasis, alas, on “almost.” Because ultimately, the ingratiating eccentricities of “Venom” aren’t enough to really distinguish the movie from its superhero-movie brethren as it devolves into the usual expensive orgy of sound, fury and wisecracking.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Viking Destiny,’ a Warrior Princess Reclaims Her Throne","See Terence Stamp declaim from beneath a mothy blanket, then disappear in a puff of smoke! See a metal-caged severed head swing from a chain like a gruesome tea ball! These dubious pleasures and more await in “Viking Destiny,” a bit of low-budget Nordic nonsense that only makes you appreciate the visual finesse and rowdy discipline of the History channel’s “Vikings.” Pillaging done right is nothing to sniff at. While we wait for season 5 of that show to resume, we can head to the mythical kingdom of Volsung, where the language is aphorisms (“A day of grief is longer than a year of joy”) and the king is dead. His putative heir is more wimp than warrior, but luckily a swapped-at-birth plot means the rightful heir, Helle (Anna Demetriou), a Richard Thompson fantasy of red hair and black leather, is as handy with a sword as a curling iron. Forced to flee when her wicked Uncle Bard (Timo Nieminen) frames her for murder, Helle frets to reclaim her kingdom, which seems to consist of roughly five people and some woodland-dwelling, vegetarian peaceniks. “Would you care to join us for turnips?,” they offer, before agreeing to become her army, albeit one equipped mostly with artisanal implements. Unconvincing battle scenes, though, aren’t the half of it: this second feature from David L.G. Hughes also supplies keening choirs and gods (hello, Mr. Stamp) who pop out of Valhalla to whisper in ears and dispense magic mushrooms. The politics, at least, are current. “The gods would never allow it!,” Bard scoffs, scandalized by the idea of putting a woman on the throne. As we’ve learned all too well, he’s right.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Wajib,’ a Father and Son Trek Through Nazareth","There’s a quiet warmth that runs like a current through “Wajib,” a new film from the Palestinian director and writer Annemarie Jacir. The title is Arabic for “duty,” and here the obligation is shared by father and son. Abu Shadi, an aging divorcee living in a Christian Palestinian community in Nazareth, is driving around his neighborhood and its outskirts all day at the beginning of the Christmas season — he’s got “Jingle Bells” as his phone’s ringtone — hand-delivering invitations to his daughter’s wedding. With him is his son, Shadi, an architect who now makes his home in Rome. Their duty dictates that they go door to door as a team, but their united front is strained. Abu Shadi is unhappy that Shadi has left Nazareth, and that he’s involved with a woman whose father is a Palestinian activist — “a P.L.O. leader,” Abu Shadi says indignantly. Shadi bristles at the prospect of visiting one neighbor who he says conducted surveillance on Shadi and his friends when they were at school. Despite their mutual irritation, there’s a real bond here; it helps that the characters are played by a real life father and son, Mohammad Bakri and Saleh Bakri. Their sessions with neighbors who have varied survival strategies are suffused with intrigue and philosophical pertinence, and their exchanges with each other pivot from exasperation to affection more often than the other way around. Ms. Jacir is a thrifty filmmaker; there’s nothing frilly in this movie. But she is also a sensitive and imaginative and resourceful one. The film’s final scene, a lyrical sunset that ends with a nearly four-minute unbroken shot in which the father and son converse with amity and resolution, is a fine testimony to the director’s powers.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘What They Had,’ a Family Bickers While a Mother Drifts Away","Programmatic and groaningly trite, “What They Had,” the debut feature from Elizabeth Chomko, would be impossible to swallow without its star-studded cast. Even so, it requires all their considerable skills to stop this soapy family drama from sliding into complete banality. Based on Chomko’s own family history, the story circles the slow drift into dementia of Ruth (Blythe Danner), the beloved wife of Bert (a perfect Robert Forster). Caught at the outset wandering into a snowstorm in her coat and nightie, Ruth is retrieved to face her adult children and a teenage granddaughter, who have reluctantly gathered in the couple’s Chicago home to fight about what is to be done. There’s so much bickering, though, that the dementia itself — unlike in Sarah Polley’s heartbreaking 2007 drama, “Away From Her” — soon fades into the background. Bridget (Hilary Swank), a dithering California chef, is unwilling to support her brother, Nicky (Michael Shannon), in his plan to install Ruth in something called a “memory care” facility. While Nicky stews over Bridget’s favored-child status and Bert’s refusal to respect his bar-owning career choice, Bridget chafes over her atrophied marriage and a whiny daughter (Taissa Farmiga) who’s having second thoughts about college. Bert, for his part, clings to denial and his belief that commitment is the only marital vow that matters. Classily shot by Roberto Schaefer, “What They Had” is the sort of movie that can earn a pass purely on the sensitivity of its subject matter. And though occasional bursts of spikiness suggest that Chomko has a more unexpected story to tell, the narrative beats of this one — even without its eye-rolling final shot — are audible well in advance of the end credits.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘When We Went Electronic,’ Hell Is Available in Spandex","Bethany and Brittany — creatures of nylon, texturizer and vocal fry — are sales associates at the flagship branch of American Apparel. Their tights are ripped. Their bruises are covered by Ray-Bans. They can’t remember what happened last night, and they can’t seem to leave this stockroom. Think “No Exit,” with Lycra. A slapdash lampoon of sexual trauma and noxious masculinity, “When We Went Electronic,” written by Caitlin Saylor Stephens and directed by Meghan Finn for the Tank in Manhattan, is a show in love with its own grotesquerie, a fun house ride that’s just a pile of distorting mirrors. Bethany (Drita Kabashi) seems to be Brittany’s superior, and her preferred conversational style is the insult: “Ur advanced basic.” “Please betch. Ur just outdated.” Brittany (Tiffany Iris) sleepwalks around the store, wondering vaguely where her gashes came from and why there’s a condom in her updo. Ms. Stephens’s script plays word games with their worldview, replacing the word “look” with “lookbook,” “see” with “go-see,” “smashed” with “high-waisted.” When the words stop, they pose and pout and break into electroclash tunes by Sarah Frances Cagianese and Ms. Stephens. The play’s pervy, perverse influence is American Apparel’s founder, Dov Charney. The favored oath is “Ohmidov!” (I first heard it as “Oh my dog,” then I twigged.) Mr. Charney, ousted in 2014 after an onslaught of sexual harassment allegations, considered sex with employees part of his compensation. “Sleeping with people you work with is unavoidable!” he told a Guardian journalist in 2017. (Full disclosure: I used to shop at American Apparel until I read reports of Mr. Charney’s behavior. More disclosure: I still kind of miss their leggings.) “When We Went Electronic” is a nightmare vision of sexual availability and minimum-wage retail. And yet the semiotics of this show are a mess, super “high-waisted.” To illustrate a toxic workplace and the women who internalize it, the play has its underdressed actresses pose for crotch shots. (I’m sure they’re not victims. I’m sure they’re equal collaborators and having a high-old time. But still.) The play wrings its laughs — and, in fairness, its horror — from just how vapid its characters are. The obvious, inarguable point is that no one deserves assault, dumb betches included. But “When We Went Electronic” invites the audience to be part of an ugly presumption of superiority. No one is laughing with these ladies. What the show has going for it — aside from Ms. Kabashi’s savagely brittle performance and Ms. Cagianese’s deadpan bops — is its absurdist edginess. For a while, anyway. This is a taut and brutal one-act that sized up into something much baggier. There’s no conversation that doesn’t echo, no dynamic that isn’t on repeat. The title is spoken at least 30 times, and I still have no idea what it means. The play sells out its urgency long before it arcs toward revelation. By the time the actresses are assaulting each other with an emergency light stick repurposed as a dildo, just what or who is being satirized? I was ready to go analog.

2018,"Review: In ‘Wildlife,’ Passions Run Rampant","In the very first scenes of “Wildlife,” the smoke coming off the tops of the mountains north of Great Falls, Mont., is easy to take for fog, or for cloud cover. After all, the sky above that smoke is so blue, and the town below seems so tidy. The impression doesn’t last long. Fires are indeed consuming the mountain forests; kids in the local school attend a special class session in which they’re warned of the dangers of its spreading closer. One student, a lifetime local, tells her classmate, who is new in town, that he needn’t pay attention. If the destructive force of the fire gets close enough, it will be too late for them to do anything about it. Set in the 1960s, this superb film, directed by Paul Dano from a script he and Zoe Kazan adapted from the 1990 Richard Ford novel, puts its main adult characters in the way of destructive forces of their own conjuring soon enough. Jerry Brinson (Jake Gyllenhaal), an American dreamer whose air of optimism seems forced, has moved his wife, Jeanette (Carey Mulligan), and teenage son, Joe (the new classmate, played by Ed Oxenbould), a little too frequently for either of their liking. After Jerry is fired as a golf pro at a country club, Jeanette grits her teeth and tries to offer solutions. He is offered his job back — golf pros are presumably difficult to come by in these parts — but insists, “I won’t work for people like that.” Instead, he takes a low-paying job as a firefighter in the nearby mountains, leaving Jeanette and Joe to fend for themselves. Joe, quiet and industrious, gets a part-time job at a photo shop, while Jeanette, who has been working as a swimming instructor, notices the friendly attention of one of her students, Warren Miller (Bill Camp). He is an older, stocky, prosperous owner of a car dealership, and she decides to return his attention. Rather than hide her escalating liaison from her son, she drags him into the affair, as if she needed Joe to understand just how unhinged her married life has finally made her. “Wildlife” is a domestic drama both sad and terrifying. The entire cast does exceptional work (Oxenbould is an exciting find), but the movie is anchored by Mulligan, who gives the best performance of any I’ve seen in film this year. The stiff simulation of determined cheer with which Jeanette often speaks has a vehemence to it, particularly in the sibilants she pronounces. Her physical bearing is also striking: In this role, Mulligan can say more by just tensing her neck than most actors can with a lengthy, impassioned soliloquy. It is mesmerizing to watch the character struggle with the question of whether or not she is entitled to her rage before she lets go and gives into it — and finds that doing so gives her no satisfaction whatsoever. Dano’s direction is meticulous in every respect, which enables him to keep the characters at a remove that is both cleareyed and compassionate. The sharp cinematography by Diego Garcia is ideal for Dano’s purpose. The whole of the film is a potent collaboration in every respect, and a remarkable directorial debut.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Wobble Palace,’ a Relationship Hangs by a Stringy Toupee","It isn’t often that a hairstyle becomes the conduit for a film’s soul. In “Wobble Palace,” a comedy that centers on the trials of try-hard millennials, Eugene (Eugene Kotlyarenko) and Jane (Dasha Nekrasova) are a couple in the death throes of their relationship. They see other people, but they haven’t broken up because neither wants to move out of the apartment they share in downtown Los Angeles — an art-freak crash pad with AstroTurf carpets and curtains printed to look like a crowded Windows desktop, complete with the ubiquitous grassy knoll. To satisfy their desire for time to themselves, they decide to split the apartment over a weekend. Eugene’s day comes first, and he begins it by swiping through Tinder on the toilet. It would be impossible to miss that Eugene is balding. Around the shiny dome of his forehead, his remaining hair passes his shoulders. By the time Eugene’s date appears for brunch, he has fashioned a hair piece that is as fantastic as it is foolhardy: He wraps his stringy fringe into a bun and fastens it above his bald spot. It’s a style he calls the “floating toupee.” The date does not go well. But the coif is magnificent, an exposed ego of an updo that communicates all the shoestring pretensions of the world Eugene and Jane occupy together. In fitting concordance with his self-conscious character, Mr. Kotlyarenko directed the film, and the story was conceived by both its stars. Every moment is as cringe-worthy and creative as Eugene’s floating toupee. Movies about the millennial moment are multitudinous, but “Wobble Palace” is special: a sendup of broke-artist types that shimmers with abashed affection.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Jonas Kaufmann Dials Up the Swoon Factor,"Jonas Kaufmann does not need a microphone, he wants you to know. At the start of “You Mean the World to Me” at Carnegie Hall on Friday, this star tenor addressed the audience to explain the Art Deco-style mic planted in front of him. “It’s not so much that I’m getting old and feel I can’t fill Carnegie Hall with my voice,” Mr. Kaufmann, 49, said, drawing indulgent laughter. “It’s the atmosphere.” He explained that the evening’s program of operetta arias and film songs from the 1920s and ’30s spanned a range of instrumentation from full orchestra to chamber jazz ensemble and that amplification helped unify different sound worlds. But, he added, “don’t be afraid that I’m hiding behind it.” Mr. Kaufmann’s vocal prowess was hardly in doubt. He continues to be one of the most sought-after tenors with the stamina and heft for Wagner and the ardent warmth for Italian opera. (Next week he steps into the Metropolitan Opera’s production of Puccini’s “La Fanciulla del West.”) With its dark shadings, his tenor sounds the way he looks — matinee idol features offset by designer stubble. With his program of songs popular in the Berlin of the Weimar Republic, Mr. Kaufmann dials up the swoon factor. The arias from operettas by Franz Lehar and Emmerich Kalman and songs from the silver screen by composers including Robert Stolz and Hans May brought to life a moment just before popular music forked off from the classical tradition. The texts — about the loneliness of an empty bed, feverish dreams, the permissive darkness of a Viennese alley — are coy but knowing. The formal lyricism of the vocal lines creates tunes that flatter the ear and lodge themselves in the memory after a single hearing. Whether these tunes are orchestrated with syrupy strings and rippling harps as in Richard Tauber’s “Du bist die Welt für mich,” which lends the program its title, or set with a jazz shimmer like Stolz’s “Im Traum hast Du mir alles erlaubt” (“In my dream you allowed me everything”) this is music like liqueur: sweet, sticky and apt to loosen listeners up . The Orchestra of St. Luke’s, directed by Jochen Rieder, played it with idiomatic style. In the transitions from full-bodied operatic singing to crooning, Mr. Kaufmann’s different levels of experience showed through. He was magnificent when he belted out “Freunde, das Leben ist lebenswert” (“Friends, life is worth living”) from Lehar’s “Giuditta,” a proud and fiery aria. In a song like “Im Traum,” where he produced phrases in a silky head voice that faded to falsetto, it sometimes sounded like he was still experimenting with the effects of the microphone. But he gave a beautiful rendering of Mischa Spoliansky’s “Heute Nacht oder nie” (“Tonight or never”). He calibrated his voice exquisitely to the accompanying chamber ensemble, in which a solo violin acts like a wing man to the serenading singer. Ultimately the possibilities a microphone opens up — the way a voice can suddenly insinuate itself into a radio listener’s private space — are best mined by singers who are also actors. Mr. Kaufmann doesn’t quite have a cabaret performer’s intuition for how to sex up a seemingly innocent word with innuendo or irony in the occasional near-spoken phrase. But hearing this repertory sung by a consummate opera performer helped illuminate a musical moment suspended between nostalgia and modernity.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Jonas Kaufmann, Back at the Met, Is Good, Not Great","You could feel trepidation at the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday as the audience took its seats for Puccini’s “La Fanciulla del West.” The superstar tenor Jonas Kaufmann was finally returning after an absence of four and a half years, including withdrawals from two new productions conceived with him in mind. Would he actually show? [Read our interview with Mr. Kaufmann about his return to the Met.] He did, for the first of four performances through Oct. 27. He came, he sang, he — well, if he didn’t entirely conquer, Mr. Kaufmann certainly reminded us why he’s been missed. “Fanciulla,” a tale of hardscrabble miners during the California Gold Rush, is, I’m more convinced at each encounter, one of Puccini’s finest operas. But you need persuasive singers to plumb the depths of the music and the subtleties of the characters. The hero, Dick Johnson — actually a bandit fleeing the law — shows up intent on thievery but falls in love with Minnie, who runs the town saloon and tends to the miners with motherly affection. It’s a good role for Mr. Kaufmann, who conveys Johnson’s inner torment while exuding charisma. The chemistry between him and the soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek, who brings a strong, silvery voice and appealing vulnerability to the role, was palpable during their initial exchanges. (Ms. Westbroek has been singing Minnie opposite the tenor Yusif Eyvazov since this 1991 production returned earlier this month.) The dusky colorings of Mr. Kaufmann’s voice gave his singing of this Italianate music a Germanic cast, but that quality made his Johnson seem, intriguingly, more of an outsider. He brought melting richness and dramatic nuances to his performance, supported by the sensitive conducting of Marco Armiliato. Mr. Kaufmann and Ms. Westbroek seemed to feed off each other during the crucial scene in Act II when Johnson arrives at Minnie’s cabin for a humble meal. Tension stirs below the surface of the music as a blizzard builds outside and a posse of miners led by Jack Rance, the town sheriff (the husky-voiced baritone Zeljko Lucic), closes in. But the real tension came from the hints of attraction and emotional need that Mr. Kaufmann and Ms. Westbroek conveyed, even while exchanging seemingly innocent phrases. Still, at a moment when Mr. Kaufmann has been taking on demanding dramatic tenor roles like Verdi’s Otello — and even testing the waters of Wagner’s Tristan — his singing seemed a little underpowered. He summoned some full-voiced, exciting high notes during the opera’s only real aria, when Johnson, who thinks he’s about to be hanged, begs the men to tell Minnie that he has been set free to lead a better life. Yet at times his voice seemed curiously restrained. For a while, Mr. Kaufmann was hands down the most exciting tenor in opera. Now he has some younger competition, including at the Met, where the thrilling tenor Vittorio Grigolo, who stepped in when Mr. Kaufmann withdrew from a new production of Puccini’s “Tosca,” has become a house favorite. It is, however, without a doubt great to have the compelling Mr. Kaufmann back with the company.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Looking Anew at a Norwegian Massacre in ‘22 July’,"“The civil war has started.” This is what the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik announced to the interviewers interrogating him on July 22, 2011. Earlier that day, Breivik had parked a van crammed with about 2,000 pounds of explosives in front of a 17-story government building in central Oslo housing both the prime minister’s office and the Ministry of Justice. The bomb exploded, killing eight, while he was driving the 19 miles to a summer camp on Utoya Island run by the Labor Party. There, he slaughtered 69 additional people, most of them teenagers. Paul Greengrass’s latest, “22 July,” recreates the massacre and its aftermath. Fiction that hews close to fact, the movie is serious and meticulous, yet hollow. Best known for his contributions to the Bourne franchise, Greengrass also has a longstanding interest in terrorism, which he’s explored in movies as distinct as “United 93” and “Captain Phillips.” He brings his estimable skills to this new story, taking you through it, grim beat by beat. He introduces the characters, some soon to be dead, and restages the assault, the trial and the grief. Guns are discharged, tears shed, experts consulted, Breivik’s noxious views aired. All that is missing is a clear, motivating idea (political or otherwise). The movie opens on the day of the attack, and after some pro forma place setting — aerial shots of the lush countryside — quickly gets to the carnage. As is his wont, Greengrass employs a fast, kinetic approach and uses crosscutting to knit together assorted locations and characters, especially Breivik (Anders Danielsen Lie), who’s seen preparing for his mission, putting on a police uniform and hitting the road, all while crowds of smiling young people arrive on Utoya. Breivik’s lethal actions tie these and a few other places and faces together, including his watchful, distant mother (Hilde Olausson), and the prime minister (Ola G. Furuseth) and other government types. Beginning with the assault carries some risks simply because it could turn you off right from the start. It also means that Breivik — his plan, inscrutable face and horrifying actions — immediately takes over the movie, making him its focus and most obvious reason for being. At the same time, because Greengrass frontloads the story in this manner, he doesn’t build to the massacre, an approach that might (as is too often the case) turn horror into the narrative climax. Instead, he gets the bloodshed out of the way, showing that his interest lies elsewhere, including on Viljar (Jonas Strand Gravli), an idealistic camper who’s repeatedly shot by Breivik. Written by Greengrass, the movie is based on the journalist Asne Seierstad’s 2013 book, “One of Us: The Story of Anders Breivik and the Massacre in Norway,” a movie-ready nonfiction account that reads like a page-turning thriller. Like “22 July,” the book is certainly unsettling, although, as its subtitle suggests, it also has ideas about Norway, not just documentation. Her portrait of Breivik is bleakly common: He had an unhappy childhood and spent a lot of time alone in his bedroom. There, he went from obsessively playing video games like World of Warcraft to scrolling through extremist sites that fulminated against women, Marxism and Islam, a correlation that Greengrass wisely avoids. In the movie, Breivik announces his beliefs (they’re too muddled to rise to the level of ideology, at least here) while he’s unloading his guns on Utoya, promising the campers — he calls them Marxists — that they’re going to die. After he is captured, he continues his vocal offensive, self-importantly calling himself a soldier in a larger political war involving the West and Islam. Best known for his sensitive performances in movies by Joachim Trier, including “Oslo, August 31,” Lie does what he can with a role that doesn’t call for much introspection. Even so, his is the most nuanced and convincing performance by far in the movie, which means that Breivik becomes the character we most want to see. Greengrass clearly wants to understand Breivik, to get at — much as Seierstad tries to do in her book — or even explain why someone like this exists, presumably as a political warning. And so, much like the trial lawyers, Greengrass gathers the evidence, sifts through the facts and pokes in shadowy, right-wing extremist corners. Still, the larger political and national picture remains blurry as the story jumps from the trial to scenes of governmental reckoning and Viljar’s long, hard recovery. And while the decision to consistently cut between Breivik and Viljar creates tension, it also means that victim and victimizer too often carry similar narrative weight, which is unfortunate.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Melissa McCarthy Is Criminally Good in ‘Can You Ever Forgive Me?’,"Lee Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year, which is not to say that she’s altogether pleasant company. She would most likely feel the same way about you, minus the “interesting” part, unless you happen to be a cat or Dorothy Parker. It has been a while since a world-class, life-size misanthrope like Lee has commanded the screen — not another brooding narcissist or a showily difficult cable TV antihero, but a smart, cranky human recognizably made of flesh and blood. Also whiskey, bile and typewriter ink. There was a real Lee Israel, a writer turned literary forger who died in 2014. In “Can You Ever Forgive Me?,” based on Israel’s memoir of the same name, she’s played by Melissa McCarthy, in a performance that more than atones for “Life of the Party” and “The Happytime Murders.” Though McCarthy has played abrasive and obnoxious comic characters in the past — it’s one of her specialties — Lee is a 3-D grouch of a whole different order. [Read our profile of Melissa McCarthy (it might cheer you up).] Early in the film, she treks across Manhattan from her place on West 82nd Street to a literary party at her agent’s apartment, which is much nicer than her own. Lee makes the rounds, sneering and muttering into her double Scotch; spars with the agent, whose name is Marjorie; and leaves with a few partial rolls of pilfered toilet paper, a napkin full of boiled shrimp (to be shared with her cat, Jersey) and someone else’s overcoat. It’s 1991, and Lee, the author of several popular biographies of bygone celebrities, finds herself in career limbo — or possibly professional free fall. It’s too early to blame her woes on the internet, as future writers will. For reasons that Marjorie (Jane Curtin) is a little too eager to explain, Lee’s proposed life of the great vaudevillian Fanny Brice is a non-starter. An earlier book about Estée Lauder is for sale at a humiliating discount in a used bookstore. The rent is overdue. There’s no money to pay Jersey’s veterinary bills. A life of crime beckons. What Lee falls into is no ordinary criminal enterprise, and her eventual accomplice is not a typical underworld minion. For a time, the only nonfeline companion Lee can tolerate is Jack Hock (Richard E. Grant), a bon vivant of infinite charm, no fixed address and ambiguous professional bona fides. If Lee is a rent-stabilized Dorothy Parker, Jack is a couch-crashing Oscar Wilde — utterly ignorant of literature but naturally witty and great fun to be around. He’s game for anything, including serial fraud. The scam arises by accident. Lee stumbles across — O.K., steals — a Fanny Brice letter and discovers that there’s a modestly remunerative market for that kind of memorabilia in the city’s used bookstores. The problem is that the letters for sale are often boring, perfunctory notes valued mainly for the famous signature. Lee sets out to improve the epistolary record (and increase the asking price) by fabricating dazzling missives from the likes of Parker, Lillian Hellman and Noël Coward. (The film’s title is a priceless bit of faux Parker.) It’s an elaborate grift, but also, she begins to feel, a literary art form in its own right. “Can You Ever Forgive Me?,” directed by Marielle Heller (“The Diary of a Teenage Girl”), is catnip for the bookish. It will also appeal to anyone with nostalgia for a generally underappreciated era in New York history, when the high glamour felt a little scuffed, the urban apocalypse had been postponed, and Manhattan abounded in bookstores and scruffy gay bars. Enough of these are still around — including Argosy Book Store on East 59th and Julius’ on West 10th — to provide the film with locations and an atmosphere of lived-in cosmopolitan bohemianism. There were no Starbucks or co-working spaces back then. A person could breathe, and read. Partly because the movie is so splendidly and completely absorbed in its characters and their milieu, it communicates much more than a quirky appreciation for old books and odd readers. Ms. Heller and the screenwriters, Jeff Whitty and the great Nicole Holofcener, resist the impulse to moralize about Lee’s misdeeds or to sand down her rough edges. Like “The Diary of a Teenage Girl,” which handled disturbing material with grace and good humor, “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” is neither judgy nor ethically neutral. Lee and Jack can be gleefully amoral, and will go to great lengths to justify their actions, but they don’t entirely lack conscience or decency. In what is perhaps a violation of the con artist’s code, Lee befriends one of her marks, a bookseller named Anna (Dolly Wells). Anna is both a fan and a gentle kindred spirit, at least as far as literary taste is concerned, and the possibility of romance flickers between them. (The fact that Jack and Lee are gay is both crucially important and no big deal.) It’s painful to watch Lee’s instinctive recoil from the possibility of intimacy, but her stubborn aloneness is also a kind of integrity. The last thing we could ever do is feel sorry for her. Which brings me back to where I started. Lee is interesting because she is so entirely herself, even as she makes her living pretending to be other people. The writers she impersonates survive because of their outsize individuality, a quality of brazen inventiveness that she is able to counterfeit because she shares it. Of course there’s only one Dorothy Parker. It might also be said — Lee Israel herself might have said, in her own voice or Parker’s — that it takes one to know one.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Netflix’s ‘Wanderlust’ Is an Experiment in Fidelity,"“Wanderlust” begins with Joy, the British therapist played by Toni Collette, getting back on the bike, literally and figuratively. Out of commission after an accident that left her with a broken hip, she straps on an industrial-grade helmet and pedals slowly down the street, even though she’s still having trouble walking. At about the same time, she tries restarting another activity, sex with her schoolteacher husband, Alan (Steven Mackintosh). This doesn’t go as well. “I don’t think you want to have sex with me,” he says, and Joy’s silent reaction — Ms. Collette’s darting eyes signaling sheepishness, guilt and relief — leaves no doubt that he’s right. The opening credits of “Wanderlust” — a BBC One-Netflix series, created and written by the British playwright Nick Payne, that came to Netflix on Friday — include a definition of the show’s title: strong longing for or impulse toward wandering. Its six hourlong, comic-dramatic episodes chronicle a controlled experiment in indulging such an impulse. Joy and Alan quickly work out their frustrations, he with his fellow teacher, Claire (Zawe Ashton), and she with a cop from her hydrotherapy class (William Ash of “The Tunnel”), and just as quickly confess to each other. Joy, a problem solver, proposes that they continue having sex with others while maintaining their marriage. Alan offers up some passive-aggressive evasions, but he’s into it, too, if not as determinedly as Joy. “It’s the difference between a snack and a meal,” he says. “Maybe.” Payne’s best-known play, the romantic tragedy “Constellations,” which was produced on Broadway with Ruth Wilson and Jake Gyllenhaal, was exceptionally smart and moving. And as “Wanderlust” (which was based on another of his plays) gets going, you can anticipate that he’ll have an interesting take on love and fidelity and look forward to seeing it fleshed out by Collette, who can bring complicated characters to life with seemingly no effort. But that’s not where “Wanderlust” is going. Payne seems to be conducting his own experiment: to see how closely he can mimic the shallow charms of a Richard Curtis rom-com. He does a good job over all, demonstrating the same ability to jump between labored comic business and somber melodrama, often within a scene; the same willingness to make his characters look ridiculous; the same habit of getting out of a bland or nonsensical scene by ending on a non sequitur punch line; the same reliance on snippets of pop music to pump up emotion. Payne is artsier, though, which means a higher level of literary name-dropping — Joy and Alan’s 16-year-old son, Tom (Joe Hurst), courts his high school crush using tickets to a Zadie Smith reading — and a more insistent focus on glum psychology and dark consequences. Joy’s idea works well at first, magically rekindling her and Alan’s interest in each other. And it looks like the series will explore the question of whether they can happily maintain both their marriage and their affairs, especially Alan’s increasingly intimate attachment to Claire. At the same time, in an intricate but not very interesting counterpoint, we see the fumbling beginnings of relationships for their three children and the depressing impasses reached by several of Joy’s therapeutic clients. Then along comes a stunt episode — an entire hour devoted to a session between Joy and her own therapist, played by Sophie Okonedo, playing out in something close to real time. Payne changes the rules on us, taking a theme of debilitating grief that had been hinted at and making it the central term of his equation — “Death, Actually.” (It’s also a narrative cheat that allows Payne to arrange his ending the way he wants it, regardless of how Joy’s and Alan’s liaisons would be likely to play out in real life.) If you’ve reached that point, you might as well hold on to see whether Joy and Alan can ride it out. Before that, the performances and Payne’s skill with dialogue have their rewards, though they’re attenuated — Payne doesn’t have the conviction of a true schlockmeister, and he doesn’t deliver the boffo laughs and tears of a Curtis film. Ashton, who was funny as the uptight assistant of Jason Isaacs’s detective in “Case Histories,” is clever and touching here as Claire, who surprises herself (and the audience) by falling for Alan. Isis Hainsworth of “Harlots” is good as the quiet best friend of Joy and Alan’s son. For her part, Collette sails through the six hours, easily carrying off the therapy episode and making the good moments Payne gives her delightful, like Joy’s karaoke rendition of “Here Comes the Rain Again” or the happiness on her face when she’s standing alone in a club listening to the band. Collette makes us believe in Joy; if only Payne had made us care.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: O, for a Muse of Fire, or a Comptroller, to Save ‘Popcorn Falls’","A comedy with buttery flavoring, “Popcorn Falls,” at the Davenport Theater, is the story of a parched town saved by a show. I can’t prove that the script was born when the playwright James Hindman fell asleep in the tub after watching a bunch of let’s-put-on-a-show Mickey Rooney movies, but it’s as plausible as anything else. As the play opens, Popcorn Falls is in a parlous state. When a nearby dam desiccated the waterfall, the town’s sole beauty spot, tourists fled and commerce withered. Ted Trundle (Adam Heller), the new mayor, is hoping for a bailout from the Cattaraugus County Budget Planning Committee. But the committee plans to demolish the downtown and build a sewage treatment plant on its ruins. Ted’s only hope of salvation lies with an arts council check intended for the local theater. Trouble is, there is no local theater. If Ted can create one and put on a play in just one week, he can cash that check and buy the town enough time to — um, that’s not really clear. (Let’s just say there are some story gaps.) Anyway, Ted and his faithful custodian, Joe (Tom Souhrada), assemble a company of rude mechanicals. How rude? Rude enough for an extended diarrhea joke. Together they get to playmaking. One scrapped draft involves a kitten, a pirate and a happy ending. This I would see. As for Mr. Hindman’s opus, it’s chockablock with jokes, provided your definition of what constitutes a joke is generous and loose. Here’s one: “George Washington dined on that very land.” “Well, it was a picnic lunch.” Here’s another: “I would appreciate it if you’d make like a banana and vamoose.” See what I mean? Not so much a laugh riot as a laugh scuffle. It’s rare that a play manages to be both predictable and confusing. Does most of the town die at the end? Again, unclear. But as directed by the Tony-winning actor Christian Borle — maybe a bet was lost? — “Popcorn Falls” is also almost charming. The 20-odd corny, zany, iodized salt-of-the-earth townsfolk are all played by Mr. Heller and Mr. Souhrada, though really mostly by Mr. Souhrada, whose ability to veer from character to character to character risks whiplash. The actors are enjoying the material and enjoying each other and their zippy enthusiasm is reasonably infectious. Assuming everyone survives, this is basically a feel-good show and it promotes some feel-good myths: Namely, that art has civic virtue and demonstrable civic value. Are these myths true? I hope so. Then I think about how long “Mamma Mia!” ran. But art — even flippant, sweet-natured, intentionally farcical art — can stand to be better than this. Is it really too late to go back to the kitten and pirate? This information was last updated on Nov. 5, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Paul Butterfield’s Story Is Told in ‘Horn From the Heart’,"The blues, once the foundation of several dominating modes of American popular music, still informs what we hear in our homes and on our devices, but not as overtly as it used to. We don’t talk about blues artists that much today. Like jazz and folk, it is, in its ostensibly pure form, appreciated in small corners by enthusiasts. I have to remind myself of these things whenever I hear an artist like Paul Butterfield, the blues singer and harmonica player who was prominent in the ’60s and ’70s. He died in 1987 at 44 of an accidental overdose. As one of the interview subjects in “Horn From the Heart: The Paul Butterfield Story” puts it, just three notes from Butterfield’s harp were enough to establish a groove, or vastly improve an existing one. John Anderson, who directs this documentary, does a brisk job of explaining the milieu in which Butterfield learned his craft. As a youngster in Chicago he took classical flute lessons but was drawn to the city’s blues clubs. Butterfield answered the question, “Can a white man play the blues?” not just with his own excellence but with his dedication to racial equality as a bandleader. “I’m not bragging but I didn’t see nobody else who was better,” says Sam Lay, one of the earliest African-American drummers for the first Butterfield Blues Band. “And we happened to be black and white.” In terms of production values, this is not a snazzy film. But the interview footage with family and colleagues, including Bonnie Raitt and Elvin Bishop, an early Butterfield guitarist, is smart and thorough. While the last third of Butterfield’s life is tragic, spending the better part of 90 minutes with the man and his music is exhilarating. The picture may get at least a few people talking about him again.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Puccini’s American Opera Needs a New American Vision,"“My heart was beating like the double basses in the card scene,” Puccini told The New York Times in 1910, after the premiere of his Western-themed “La Fanciulla del West” at the Metropolitan Opera. That scene is a pivotal moment for the heroine, Minnie, as she gambles her lover’s life on a game of poker with the town sheriff. In the pit, jittery 16th notes in the basses ratchet up tension. The Met can make even stars anxious. Nerves certainly seemed stretched on Thursday during the season premiere of Giancarlo del Monaco’s 1991 production of Puccini’s opera about love and redemption during the California gold rush. In the title role, the soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek sometimes sounded shrill and squally. Her amber-flecked voice had plenty of fire power, but top notes overshot the mark, coming out tight and aggressive. As Dick Johnson, the bandit Minnie redeems with her love, the tenor Yusif Eyvazov got off to a tremulous start, with lines first wan in the lower register, then brash without warning as the melody rose. (Mr. Eyvazov has only three performances in this role before the box-office darling Jonas Kaufmann takes over on Oct. 17.) But by the middle of Act II, the performance settled, and especially Mr. Eyvazov’s voice relaxed and warmed up. In the scene where Dick and Minnie reveal themselves to each other in her cabin, Mr. Eyvazov sang with appealing lyricism, effusive but firm. Puccini’s score here is a marvel of sonic perspective. A gauzy offstage male chorus shadows Johnson’s lines, lending depth to the portrait of an outlaw tentatively probing his conscience. The conductor Marco Armiliato gave a magisterial reading of this sophisticated music with its modernist colorings and rhythmic verve. The large cast — almost all men — was well stocked with talent. As Ashby, the bass Matthew Rose stood out, as did the baritone Michael Todd Simpson as Sonora. Zeljko Lucic, suffering from a cold, summoned his reserves for a menacing Jack Rance, the sheriff whose jealous love for Minnie almost costs Johnson his life. As vocal jitters calmed and the show unfolded with cinematic polish, the hollow realism of this production became apparent. Perhaps more than any other opera in the Met’s repertory, this story needs a makeover from a director unafraid to take a stance. It is, after all, a story about America written for America. Sure, the country served as an imaginary utopian space for European artists like Puccini. But the questions of “Fanciulla” strike close to home. What is gained and lost in the pursuit of riches? How can a woman maintain her autonomy and trust in love? What turns a group of jocular, Bible-fearing citizens into a lynch mob? The opera is awash with guns and casual racism. But it’s also a story about reconciliation and second chances. It deserves an updated staging. As Puccini knew when he watched the premiere, his pulse racing, what happens on the Met stage matters. An earlier version of this article twice misspelled the surname of the tenor who stars in “La Fanciulla del West” at the Metropolitan Opera. He is Yusif Eyvazov, not Ezvazov.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Remembering What Was and Wasn’t in ‘Good Grief’,"Critic’s Pick This is the way they were. Maybe. The responsibility of remembering weighs heavily on Nkechi, the narrator of “Good Grief,” Ngozi Anyanwu’s tender play about loss at an early age, which opened on Tuesday at the Vineyard Theater. Nkechi has sworn never to forget the boy she will always (probably, maybe) love more than anyone else in the world. But why is it so hard for her to see him now in her mind’s eye? Portrayed in a flux of waxing and waning certainty by Ms. Anyanwu, Nkechi keeps reframing scenes from her relationship with the charismatic MJ (Ian Quinlan), sometimes through a cold lens of regret, sometimes through the magnifying glass of myth. And as the images shift and change, she thinks: “Maybe I’m remembering something or someone else. Maybe I’m mixing him up with another love or person or feeling or time.” Nkechi (who is usually called N) concludes hopefully, “But maybe he did exist.” The very youthful profundity of such thoughts saturates this lyrical production, directed as a flickering string of moments by Awoye Timpo. “Good Grief” is shaped by the existential self-consciousness that grips adolescents dealing with the cold fact of mortality. It dares to be as fanciful, histrionic, awkward and downright terrified as young people are in that period when the hormones kick in and emotions seesaw between extremes. It’s a time when your own incandescent vitality makes death seem both impossible and irresistible. Death, accordingly, comes up often in the playful but absolutely serious conversations of N, the daughter of Nigerian-Americans in suburban Pennsylvania, and her classmate MJ. What does it feel like to die? What happens after? And not just to the dead people, but to those who are left behind. Such talk is delivered in fragments in “Good Grief,” which takes place between 1992 and 2005, or rather in an indefinite present in which N restlessly recalls that period. The script jumps almost haphazardly among those years, from the day N meets MJ in elementary school to the shadowed months of her life that stretch into seeming endlessness after he is killed in a car crash. What was once a teasing abstraction has become an implacable reality. And N finds herself forever reliving, and rewriting, those days when she and MJ — her best friend and almost lover — would talk and talk and talk about who they were, and how they might be remembered. In tone, “Good Grief” brings to mind sentimental young adult novels of premature tragedy like John Green’s best-selling “The Fault in Our Stars.” In form, it is considerably more adventurous. In her introductory notes for the play Ms. Anyanwu says of its structure, “If there is any, then this is how it goes,” before explaining how punctuation in the script should inform line readings. This experimental aspect shouldn’t put off the teenagers who would seem to be the ideal audience for this heartbroken story, nor the adults who occasionally like to revisit past days of angst and ecstasy. In a way, “Good Grief” is a quieter, more meditative equivalent to the Broadway-bound “Be More Chill,” the hard-charging, smash musical about the dangers of high school popularity. Personally, I prefer the lower-volume alternative from Ms. Anyanwu, whose earlier works include the warmly received “The Homecoming Queen,” about a young woman returning to her native Nigeria from the United States. (Then again, just so you know, I’m also a fan of the teen-romance Netflix movie “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.”) “Good Grief” could benefit from a more poetic set than the tiered black box provided by Jason Ardizzone-West, with often cold lighting by Oona Curley. I appreciate that everything is occurring in N’s stark midnight of the imagination. But the look doesn’t always match Ms. Anyanwu’s language, which reaches for the stars within the darkness. The script could use more consistency and cadence in its fantasy sequences to achieve the fugue-like effect I presume Ms. Anyanwu is aspiring to. Presenting the scene in which N learns about MJ’s death as a television wrestling match makes sense. But in tone, it’s a one-off riff that doesn’t rest comfortably in context. “Good Grief” still registers throughout as an affecting study of the ambivalence of bereavement. And it is acted by a sensitive cast that finds the authentic emotion within even the most stylized scenes. Oberon K.A. Adjepong and Patrice Johnson Chevannes deftly combine brusqueness and gentleness as N’s helpless parents, who apply scraps of the lore and philosophy of their Nigerian culture in dealing with their bereaved and unresponsive daughter. (“Did you just African proverb me?” N asks her mother in exasperation.) Nnamdi Asomugha, as her jovially supportive but also grief-stunned brother, and Hunter Parrish, as a high school hunk with unexpected depths, are also spot on. But it’s the relationship between the assertive N and the dashing, good-bad boy MJ that gives the play its most haunting emotional substance. In a presumably autobiographical role, Ms. Anyanwu makes it clear that N’s strident, take-charge confidence is a shield with plenty of cracks. And Mr. Quinlan’s MJ manages to embody both a young woman’s dream and a young man’s rudderlessness. Even though they have known each other for most of their lives, N and MJ haven’t quite figured out who and what they are going to be to each other. They do know they feel less lonely — and better understood — when they’re together than when they’re with anyone else. This makes the possibility of a sexual connection seem both natural and perhaps ruinous. This is one of those young friendships that you could imagine evolving into adulthood with endless permutations, like the one so persuasively rendered in the Irish writer Sally Rooney’s new novel, “Normal People.” For N, such an evolution can only be conjectural. That void is both the setting for and the raison d’être of this sweet and sorrowful play. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Remembering the Way It Was (Not) in ‘The Things That Were There’,"Though it never, predictably enough, says a word, the lovingly polished wooden dining table in David Greenspan’s “The Things That Were There” is as eloquent as any of its characters. The mere sight of this basic piece of furniture, which occupies center stage at the Bushwick Starr in Brooklyn, almost moved me to tears before Mr. Greenspan’s brief but ponderous play even started. That no doubt has to do with said table’s resemblance to one at which my family sat down to decades’ of meals. But there’s also something about an untenanted table and chairs, clearly designed for domestic use, that whispers of lives that once gathered around it, in conversation, celebration and probably confrontation, too. Such whispers make up the dialogue of “The Things That Were There,” a vaporous piece that is as much a remembrance of plays past as it is a portrait of time recaptured. Mr. Greenspan, who has won six Obie Awards for his work as an Off Broadway actor and dramatist, has always had an affection for the avant-garde of yore. An originally offbeat presence in contemporary downtown theater, he also conveys an old-fashioned literary elegance. He has faithfully channeled the experimental visions of long-dead 20th-century artists, including Gertrude Stein, Thornton Wilder and Eugene O’Neill, whose six-hour drama “Strange Interlude” Mr. Greenspan performed (uncut) as a one-man show last year. Those American writers — along with kindred European spirits like Pirandello — may come to mind as you watch this gentle, earnest excursion into one family’s history, which is directed by Lee Sunday Evans. As in “Strange Interlude,” characters are wont to break off in mid-conversation to pursue internal monologues of subtextual longings and regrets. The central event here is a dinner in Yonkers hosted by Calvin (Evander Duck Jr.) and May (a pitch-perfect Mary Schultz), whose newly pregnant daughter, Emily (Caitlin Morris), is married to Mario (Cesar J. Rosado). Lenny (Mr. Greenspan), Mario’s father, has just arrived from the West Coast, burdened by visions of his wife, who died in an automobile crash, and of an old man he recently saw being struck by a car while crossing a street. The details of that accident blur as Lenny speaks of it. What is clear — very clear — is that everyone here is possessed by thoughts of mortality and reproachful recollections of their dearly departed. Calvin can’t stop thinking about his son, a theater artist in New York, who died of AIDS, and whom he never really knew or accepted. Emily recalls that same man as the older brother she idealized and who shaped the direction of her life. Lenny rues having had an open-casket funeral for his wife. Mario thinks of his dead mother pinching him with her arthritic fingers. Rearranging a fond gallery of aunts, uncle and parents in her mind, May says, “My memories intertwine like ivy crawling up a trellis.” This family loves its similes and metaphors. Emily, whose name and fate are the same of the heroine of Wilder’s “Our Town,” strives to create a self-portrait by evoking jigsaw puzzles she assembled. Mario keeps returning to a scene from his childhood when he grafted two trees together as a science project, a botanical experiment that will doubtless outlive him and his young son. Identities blur and time bends, as characters become themselves at different ages, coasting onto lonely tangents amid a dinner party that may already have happened, perhaps many years ago. You are also reminded that all this is but a dream of the playwright. Or as Mr. Greenspan identifies himself, “He who I am lays out my life like a cloth of stars — and scatters the stars into odd constellations — dividing memories among the characters (you see I cannot deceive you) — giving and taking as the play unfolds.” If you have a limited tolerance for such self-conscious poeticizing, you may find “Things” heavy sledding, though the play lasts less than an hour. But Ms. Evans (“Dance Nation”) wisely keeps the performances from her five cast members at a meditative simmer that never boils over into declamation and melodrama. And there are moments, when the characters seem to have forgotten who belongs to what generation, when the overlapping voices may summon layered memories of your own family gatherings, all melting into one another in retrospect. How to sort out such confusions? As the abiding anchor of Carolyn Mraz’s artfully empty set (subtly lighted by Barbara Samuels), that dark wooden table is probably the only fully reliable witness. But of course, it isn’t talking. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Rowan Atkinson Returns in ‘Johnny English Strikes Again’,"On the evidence, Rowan Atkinson’s secret agent character, Johnny English, has grown slightly less bumbling over the years, and so has the series. “Johnny English Strikes Again” has a few more laughs and far fewer cringes (and stereotypes) than the two films that preceded it. Plus it knows where to steal from. Watching it is like having a good time by proxy. The title evokes Peter Sellers’s work in “The Pink Panther Strikes Again,” and the moment when Johnny commandeers a student driver’s car is an invitation to rewatch “The Naked Gun,” which deployed a definitive version of that gag three decades ago. Johnny, who has been working as a schoolteacher, is summoned back into service after a cyberattack exposes Britain’s top agents. Emma Thompson, as the hapless, put-upon prime minister — who bears more than a slight resemblance to Theresa May — adds some welcome dryness to an otherwise very broad movie. In the two funniest sequences, Atkinson shows off the physical elasticity he honed as Mr. Bean. In one, after mistakenly ingesting a mega-stimulant, he spends a night on the dance floor unwittingly and robotically evading assassination by a Russian spy (the former bond girl Olga Kurylenko). In the other, he takes a virtual reality tour of the home of a Silicon Valley mogul (Jake Lacy, channeling Elon Musk and perhaps a bit of Mark Zuckerberg) — and accidentally strays into the streets of London. The city, if not the country, should feel fine retiring Johnny again.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Rufus Wainwright’s ‘Hadrian’ Is a Step Forward, but Still Frustrating","TORONTO — Even Rufus Wainwright now concedes that “Prima Donna,” his first opera, which received mixed to negative reviews at its 2009 premiere, was dramatically bland. But if the experience was a “nightmare” on many levels, as he said in a recent interview, he has tried to channel what he learned from it into his second opera, “Hadrian,” which had its premiere on Saturday here at the Canadian Opera Company in an elaborate, colorfully costumed production directed by Peter Hinton. Alas, “Hadrian,” which tells of this first-century Roman emperor’s love affair with Antinous, a beautiful young Greek man, is an exasperating opera, all the more so because whole stretches of Mr. Wainwright’s music are beguiling, inventive and unabashedly romantic. It’s a stronger, darker and certainly more ambitious work than “Prima Donna,” for which Mr. Wainwright co-wrote a weak French libretto. This time he collaborated with Daniel MacIvor, an award-winning Canadian playwright, who wrote a libretto that, if a little poetically stiff (“This night with you from here unspools forever”), boldly blends Hadrian’s history, as we know it, with dramatic fabrication to create a gay love story that speaks to our time. Both creators admit that their working relationship was difficult. The dramaturge Cori Ellison had to provide counseling along with professional guidance. But the new opera, even at nearly three hours long (it’s written in four acts with one intermission), is paced effectively as the story mixes elements of intimacy, grandeur, political intrigue and the supernatural. As in “Prima Donna,” Mr. Wainwright, an immensely gifted pop singer and songwriter, brings a deep love of opera to “Hadrian.” For him opera is an emotive and sweeping art form, something he never lets you forget here. Passage after passage came across as excessively frenetic, overheated, not to mention over-orchestrated. Every time there was a subdued, tender or quietly suspenseful episode in the score, you sensed the musical subtleties, wistful lyricism and ear for keen detail that have made Mr. Wainwright such a fine songwriter. In a way, the dramatic climax of “Hadrian” comes in the fraught opening scene, which takes place in 138 A.D., the last night of Hadrian’s life. Antinous has been dead for a year, and the circumstances of his death are still unclear to the emperor. (The historical record remains unclear as well.) Hadrian (the veteran baritone Thomas Hampson in a courageous performance) is gravely ill. His attendants, especially Turbo (the bass David Leigh), an old friend and military leader, harangue Hadrian to order action against enemies of the state, particularly those leading an uprising in Judea. Hadrian leans mournfully against the sarcophagus containing Antinous’s body as five male dancers in G-strings stand statuesque in the background. As the orchestra roils, with restless spiraling figures, bursts of percussion and slashing brass, the characters asking the emperor for action intone their lines in stentorian, almost monotone declamations, enforced by a large chorus. The conductor Johannes Debus manages the traffic ably and draws brassy intensity from the orchestra. But it’s too much. At one point, urged by Turbo to issue commands before it is too late, Hadrian calls out to his dead lover in pleading phrases. It’s a rich moment in the score. Below his aching lines, calm strings play strands of counterpoint that overlap into pungently mellow sonorities. I wanted more such moments. One comes later in the act. Two deities only Hadrian can see, the emperor Trajan (the tenor Roger Honeywell) and his wife, Plotina (the renowned soprano Karita Mattila in good voice), have come with a mission for him. Plotina has a wonderful aria, my favorite piece in the score. “You may see me cold,” she says, but “I am a woman first.” Her melodic lines are at once regretful and wily, supported by slightly jazzy harmonies dominated by woodwinds that reminded me of Ellington’s orchestra writing. But soon we were back to the brassy busyness. Plotina proposes to allow Hadrian to relive two crucial days in his life: the day he met Antinous, and the day Antinous died (which, in this telling, results from a strategic murder by Turbo). In return, the emperor must sign the order to crush all enemies who believe in monotheism, a creed that threatens Plotina’s status as a god. The next two acts are mostly flashbacks. The story shifts seven years earlier to Greece, when Hadrian meets Antinous, who, during a hunt, killed a boar charging at the emperor. The young Canadian tenor Isaiah Bell brings a sweetly lyrical, if sometimes strained, voice and an innocently handsome look to Antinous. Here, a rarity in opera, we have an absolute ruler and a smitten young man portrayed as defiantly and passionately in love. Their true devotion is something Hadrian’s long-suffering wife, Sabina (the compelling soprano Ambur Braid), comes to understand. That love is made explicit at the start of Act III, which takes place on a barge on the Nile six years later. Hadrian’s travels though his realm have finally landed his entourage in Egypt. In a dreamy sequence, he and Antinous are seen embracing, kissing and climbing into bed. The strings play ethereal tones, long-lingering as bits of melodic lines weave into the sonority and build slowly into radiant passages jostled with twitchy rhythms. The company is alerting the audience that this scene dares to portray two men engaged in sex. Antinous is presented as the dominant partner, as the orchestra swells and blares like a Hollywood costume drama’s film score. Though the bare-chested singers wear shorts during their lovemaking and cover themselves with robes, this staging nevertheless took some daring. Still, I found the post-passion moments of affection more moving and resonant. Though the historic Hadrian did put down the rebellion in Judea and kill many Jews, this Hadrian is depicted as tormented about it. And before his murder, Antinous, defending the Jews against attacks from sniping Roman senators, sings a paean to inclusion: “We are each in all, all in each.” It could have been cloying, but here again Mr. Wainwright drew upon the subtleties he is capable of as a composer to beguiling effect. If only this score had fewer moments of all-out, frenzied, melodramatic excess.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Sex, Lies and Vindication in a Most Timely ‘Measure for Measure’","Critic’s Pick It is one of the more repellent bargains in Shakespeare: a young woman’s virginity in exchange for her brother’s life. To our modern minds, it seems like such a no-brainer. Of course Isabella should sacrifice herself. Who would refuse that deal, ugly though it is? Yet in Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod’s vivid and uncommonly moving “Measure for Measure” — the Pushkin Theater Moscow/Cheek by Jowl production that’s part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival — she is not so easy to fault. Simply by begging Angelo, the ruler of Vienna, to spare her brother from execution, Isabella (Anna Vardevanian) has walked into a trap from which there is no safe exit. To be granted what she asks, she must have sex with Angelo (Andrei Kuzichev). Furious, frightened, sure that he’s deranged, she vows to tell the world what kind of man he really is. But her threat rolls right off him. He is, after all, famous for his rectitude. “Who will believe thee, Isabel?” Angelo says, and with the slow sweep of an arm outstretched toward the audience, he implicates us all. Performed in Russian with English supertitles (projected, with too little thought for the audience, high above the action on the BAM Harvey stage), this production had its premiere in Moscow in 2013, long before the #MeToo movement emerged as a cultural force. But in a play that examines the vicious abuses of power that people commit when they think nobody’s watching, the timeless impossibility of Isabella’s position could hardly be more sympathetic, or more central. As much as anything can be central in this inescapably messy drama, that is. “Measure for Measure” is one of Shakespeare’s problem plays, and its whole setup is bizarre. Determined to get Vienna back on the moral high ground, a licentious duke (Alexander Arsentyev) temporarily cedes power to his chilly scold of a deputy, Angelo, who proceeds to enforce laws that have lain dormant for years. Thus young Claudio (Petr Rykov), who is expecting a child with his fiancée, Juliet (Anastasia Lebedeva), is condemned to death for fornication. His sister, Isabella, a white-habited religious novice, pleads his case. Disguising himself as a friar, the duke observes the various goings-on. So, in this version, does the rest of the company, onstage throughout as a silent, peripatetic, occasionally dancing chorus. (The choreography is by Irina Kashuba, the music by Pavel Akimkin.) There is a bit of gruesomeness involving a severed head, and the plot requires some slimy sexual sleight of hand. But Mr. Donnellan, the director, and Mr. Ormerod, the designer, imbue the play with a strange, ultimately profound beauty, and the actors (including a comical Alexander Feklistov as Lucio, Claudio’s friend) make three-dimensional people out of characters who are often performed more flatly. Ms. Vardevanian is a remarkably lucid and intelligent Isabella, who has her reasons for being deathly afraid of relinquishing her virginity: shame, the risk of pregnancy. Pious though she is, she is also passionate, and when she kneels at the feet of Angelo — when he is still impassive toward her, before his lust stirs — she grabs one of his hands and covers it with kisses, beseeching him to save her brother. This touch, flesh to flesh, is what dissolves Angelo’s icy bureaucratic armor. What’s underneath is vile, brutal and shudderingly creepy (watch him fondle Isabella’s chair after she’s left), but also recognizably human. So is Isabella’s inability to compare the moral cost of her brother’s death to what she would lose in yielding to Angelo. They are, these two, harmfully mistaken in the same way: Isabella rigidly clinging to the letter of religious law, Angelo to civic law. Neither text, as written, is worth much without a dollop of mercy in the interpretation. That’s true, too, of “Measure for Measure,” a strange tangle of a play that Mr. Donnellan and Mr. Ormerod have treated with compassionate insight. Building to a sad, unsettling poignancy, their production manages to encompass the whole point of life — and the terrible, foolish risk of missing out on that.",The New York Times
2018,Review: She’s Still Debating ‘What the Constitution Means to Me’,"Within the anxiety dream of a lecture hall that is the setting for “What the Constitution Means to Me” — the agreeably baggy and highly topical performance piece that opened Sunday night at the New York Theater Workshop — the writer and actor Heidi Schreck is living out an assortment of roles. They include professor and pupil, class troublemaker and teacher’s pet, the woman in her 40s she is today and the 15-year-old girl she once was. These various roles, I should add, are not mutually exclusive, and for the most part they are all inhabited by Ms. Schreck simultaneously, in the same exhilarated, frightened and confused breath. If such an all-in-one approach sounds like it might generate ambiguity and ambivalence, well, that’s appropriate to the subject at hand. That would be the confounding, cohesive and divisive document that is the United States Constitution. This nation-founding set of principles from the late 18th century is — or should be — very much on most Americans’ minds at the moment. For the implementation of said Constitution to meet contemporary needs is largely in the interpretive hands of those men and women (but mostly men) who sit upon the Supreme Court. That those eminences may or may not wind up including one Brett M. Kavanaugh has been a cause of angry debate in recent days. Ms. Schreck’s show, which has been evolving for more than a decade, never mentions Mr. Kavanaugh by name. But his invisible judiciary presence is there, affirming many of her implicit arguments, which are often indistinguishable from her deepest fears about a document with which she has had a long and complicated relationship. Those fears were still mostly beneath the surface when Ms. Schreck began addressing the theme of “What the Constitution Means to Me,” which is directed with an invisible hand by Oliver Butler. As a high school student in Wenatchee, Wash., Ms. Schreck became a virtuoso of speech and debate competitions sponsored by the American Legion, winning prize money that paid for her college education. The participants in such competitions were asked to assess the impact of the Constitution on their own lives. The teenage Ms. Schreck appears to have fudged that part, avoiding close-to-home revelations. She is now more than making up for her past evasiveness. She relives — and reconsiders — her past oratorical triumphs in a semi-facsimile of the American Legion halls she once haunted, and which continue to haunt her. The designer Rachel Hauck has built a wood-paneled room accessorized with two flags on poles, a speaker’s podium and many, many framed photographs. The set, Ms. Schreck explains, has been built according to her memories, “like one of those crime-scene drawings.” It deviates from the originals in that — uh-oh — it doesn’t have a door. Assisted by the downtown theater stalwart Mike Iveson, who appears as the Legionnaire moderator and timekeeper, Ms. Schreck tries to reincarnate her 15-year-old self at the podium. But what the Heidi of today has learned in the intervening years — about herself, her country and the women in her family — keeps inserting itself into her original arguments. So as Ms. Schreck ponders, say, the significance of the clauses of the 14th Amendment — which her younger self describes as being “like a supercharged force field protecting all your rights” — her older self notes that those rights were available only to men. And as she reveals increasingly more about the generations of women in her family who preceded her — including her maternal grandmother, who was the victim of sustained domestic abuse — Ms. Schreck wonders about just how inclusive that force field is. The chapters of the life and personae of Ms. Schreck — a successful dramatist and television writer — are not clearly drawn. Her former and latter-day selves, as presented here, are essentially the same eager, questioning and slightly trepidatious individual, torn between the impulses to ingratiate and to challenge. The sharp-edged shards of autobiography include a story in which a college-age Ms. Schreck does not resist when a male student takes her pants off in a car to have sex because, on some instinctive and probably irrational level, she wonders if he might not otherwise hurt her. And is this relevant to our consideration of a historic legal document? Well, take another look at that wall of pictures. Its subjects are exclusively white men. So were the audiences of Legionnaires before whom the young Ms. Schreck held forth, and it is how she says she imagines us, now, watching her. The production feels less like a finished play than an endlessly open-ended conversation, being invented on the spot. (When I consulted the script after seeing to the show, I was surprised by how closely Ms. Schreck had adhered to the letter of it.) It concludes with a postscript in which a young debater of today (in my case, the dazzlingly self-assured, 14-year-old Rosdely Ciprian) squares off against Ms. Schreck to debate whether the current Constitution should be scrapped. Personally, I could have done with a bit more theatrical manipulation throughout, with more varied heightening of tone and pace. At times, listening to Ms. Schreck can feel like reading page after page of unpunctuated, unparagraphed prose. But if the show still has the shapelessness of a work-in-progress, that’s appropriate to the subject, isn’t it? The Constitution is an amorphous and ever-morphing, pliable and breathing entity. Ms. Schreck is right to regard it with fear as well as patriotic admiration. Late in the play, Ms. Schreck describes arriving in Los Angeles for work and realizing she had left a beloved doll, a sock monkey with a storied past, on the plane. Her response was to burst into public howls of rage and lamentation, worthy of a Greek tragedy. She says she doesn’t know why she’s crying though perhaps it has something to do with centuries of “inherited trauma.” Or maybe she says, “it’s the appropriate response to everything right now.” It seems safe to say that many of those who came to this show after watching Thursday’s Senate judiciary hearings understood exactly what she was feeling.

2018,Review: Sniffing Out Guilt in a Strangely Engaging ‘Border’,"Tina works security at a Swedish port. As passengers walk up a long corridor toward the terminal, she stands and looks at them. And she sniffs. Sometimes her lip curls, revealing stubby, yellow teeth. Her jutting brow ridge furrows a bit. If something agitates her, she growls. Quietly, as if trying to suppress it. She’s good at her job. For some reason she can literally sniff out guilt. Usually she catches banal lawbreakers — underage kids trying to smuggle a little booze. But one day she detains a well-dressed man who has a SIM card full of child pornography. Tina, the main character in Ali Abbasi’s “Border,” lives at a remove from society, in a forest house she shares with a man who raises dogs that she can’t be around. Enlisted by higher authorities to dig deeper into the child pornography case, she’s suddenly around people who are curious about who she is and what she can do. She’s not entirely sure about these things either. Enter Vore, who has facial features and a physical bearing similar to Tina’s. Vore studies insect larvae and collects maggots. (Not just for the sake of collecting them, either, as we’ll soon learn.) When Vore comes off a boat and looks Tina over, Vore grunts too, in a manner like Tina’s and makes a face that toggles between a leer and a sarcastic sneer. Tina (Eva Melander) doesn’t know what to make of Vore (Eero Milonoff). But Vore has a thorough understanding of the secrets that Vore and Tina share. Secrets that Tina’s father, who’s struggling with dementia, has withheld from her for years. I don’t know a lot about Swedish folklore, so I was in an especially cold state as I went into this movie, written by Abbasi, Isabella Eklof and John Ajvide Lindqvist (also the writer of the 2008 film “Let the Right One In”), from Lindqvist’s short story. As cold as possible is a good way to see it. This is a movie that aims to startle in overt and subtextual ways; the less known before viewing, the better. In its first sequences, “Border” is shot and edited in a straightforward style that suggests a documentary. The makeup work, by a large crew, alters the appearance of Melander and Milonoff most credibly. The actors are stalwart in depicting the unusual behavior of their characters. A scene in which Vore tries to convince Tina that the maggots that seem to be the biggest part of Vore’s diet are indeed scrumptious is one of the most delightfully squirm-inducing moments here. As the movie continues, it splits its narrative. One thread follows Tina as she helps the authorities catch the child pornographers, another shows Vore and Tina enthusiastically and sexually explicitly exploring their affinities. And here “Border,” which won the top prize in Cannes’ “Un Certain Regard” slate this year, becomes a somewhat more conventional genre film. Indeed, the final plot twist will elicit a nod from anyone conversant with 1980s Hollywood thrillers. But by this point, the movie has served up so many surprises, jumpy moments, and occasional but well-earned laughs that the familiarity is acceptable.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Stockard Channing Is a Mother to Remember in ‘Apologia’,"Stockard Channing wields weapons of deflection like a master samurai in Alexi Kaye Campbell’s “Apologia,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Laura Pels Theater in Manhattan. The pre-emptive put-down, the obscuring fog of abstraction, the barbed aside, the motorized monologue — such are the tools expertly deployed by Ms. Channing’s character, a celebrated art historian who has trained herself to live on the defensive. Her name is Kristin Miller, and she is described by the more temperate of her two sons as “a bloody nightmare.” Since it is Kristin who is the host of the birthday celebration (hers) at the play’s center, and since it is Ms. Channing who is portraying her, you can expect it to become an Olympic event for the hurling of slings and arrows of high wit and low cunning. But anyone who has followed Ms. Channing’s four sparkling decades on the New York stage — from her Tony-winning turn in Peter Nichols’s “A Day in the Death of Joe Egg” (1985) to her portrait of a Hollywood wife with a secret in Jon Robin Baitz’s “Other Desert Cities” (2011) — knows that there’s always more to her interpretations than her fabled way with an epigram. A sharp tongue invariably guards a fragile heart in the Channing portrait gallery, which is what makes her work so affecting. That means that Kristin and Ms. Channing are a perfect match. And her performance in “Apologia,” a Roundabout Theater Company production directed a bit stiffly by Daniel Aukin, goes some distance in disguising the labored exposition of a work that never quite achieves a natural flow or moves you as much as it should. Not that “Apologia,” which I saw with Ms. Channing last year in London, doesn’t have a lot to say that is worth listening to. As in his best-known previous work, “The Pride” (2008), a diptych of two generations of gay men, Mr. Campbell is exploring the toll exacted on those who travel roads not usually taken in convention-clogged lands. In “Apologia,” that’s “the traditionally male-dominated bastion of art history,” as Kristin’s dear friend Hugh (John Tillinger) puts it in a birthday toast. He also praises her, with tongue only partly in cheek, as “Pioneer of Arts and Letters, Champion of the Voiceless and Redemptive Savior of the Western world.” The American-born Kristin came of age in the late 1960s amid the youth-fueled political protests of Western Europe, and she adheres rigidly to the ideals of that era. The younger guests at her birthday party are judged by those standards and found seriously wanting. They include her two British sons, Peter, a banker, and Simon, a writer (both played convincingly by an agile Hugh Dancy) and the women in their lives: Trudi (Talene Monahon), Peter’s chirpy American fiancée; and Claire (Megalyn Echikunwoke), the actress who lives with Peter. That Trudi is a devout Christian and Claire the star of a soap opera become subjects of Kristin’s withering dismissals. But as insults and recriminations turn a festive occasion into the birthday dinner from hell, it becomes clear that Kristin’s attacks on the values of those around her are in part smoke screens for her own most vulnerable spot. That would be her failings as her mother. She has recently published an autobiography, which shares the title of Mr. Campbell’s play, and her sons find it all too revealing that it does not include a single mention of them. Kristin was separated from her sons by their father when the boys were 9 and 7, and Peter and the mentally unstable Simon have never forgiven her. Or as Simon, who shows up after the party has crashed and burned (and after Mr. Dancy’s other character has conveniently gone to bed), puts it: “I woke up one morning and realized that pretty much everything we are and everything we do is a response against you.” How does a mother respond to such an annihilating accusation? In Kristin’s case, by shutting down, by changing the subject, by going as numb as she possibly can. This scene, which begins the second act and is the play’s most stirring, both cruelly and compassionately lays bare the mechanics of one woman’s defense system. Mr. Campbell is posing exciting and enduringly relevant questions here, about the price for women of achieving and sustaining professional success in a male-dominated world that sees motherhood as sacred. If Kristin has become a monster, she has perhaps had little choice. Celebrity makes at least semi-monsters of most of its possessors, but men still seem to wear that status far more comfortably than women. The layers of Ms. Channing’s interpretation, with its core of lacerating anguish, are more intriguing than the plot that builds to an anticlimactic reveal. Kristin explains to the unsophisticated Trudi (it would be with an “i”) that the word apologia means “a formal, written defense of one’s opinions or conduct,” adding it is “not to be confused with apology.” All the characters wind up presenting their own apologias, often with descriptions of pasts that explain their present. When someone says, “Did I ever tell you about my father?,” you wince in anticipation of the monologue you just know is going to follow. Dane Laffrey’s set (expressively lighted by Bradley King), a mixture of country comfort and academic obsession, creates a natural environment for the examination of these specimens of humanity. And Anita Yavich’s costumes are always subtly, sociologically appropriate. Yet the dialogue only rarely feels organic. And though Ms. Monahon and Ms. Echikunwoke are very good, they don’t disguise the schematic roles of their characters. Mr. Tillinger, best known as a director, is delightful as that hoary staple of contemporary comedy, the outspoken gay best friend. But it is Ms. Channing’s complex, contradictory Kristin who keeps us thinking long after the play is over. And the wordless, gut-deep howl with which she concludes “Apologia” is more wrenching and revelatory than any of the carefully arranged words that precede it.

2018,"Review: Tere O’Connor’s ‘Long Run,’ a Dance All About Dance","The dances of Tere O’Connor are for connoisseurs. “Long Run” (2017), a 70-minute creation that had its New York City premiere in a two-night engagement beginning Friday at N.Y.U. Skirball, abounds with compositional felicities and a wide range of dance textures. Its eight dancers — five men and three women, each dressed differently — are barefoot. The best known of them is Silas Riener, who danced with Merce Cunningham’s company in 2007-2011, but all the others — Simon Courchel, Marc Crousillat, Eleanor Hullihan, Emma Judkins, Joey Loto, Lee Serle and Jin Ju Song-Begin — are skilled, unaffected performers who continue to demonstrate further dance resources as “Long Run” develops. (Nothing about the opening sections leads you to expect the amount of jumping you see later.) These performers move in solos or in ensembles of different sizes, to music, without music or regardless of music. Separate parts of the body are combined with contrasting effects. You’re made aware how many elements there are to an arm, a leg, a foot, the spine. You never know where “Long Run” is going. Its world, however, is neatly harmonious. Mr. O’ Connor knows any number of ways to subdivide his eight dancers: to have four different things happens at the same time is no trouble to him. He doesn’t, however, show us different things happening irrespective of one another. Everything seems connected, part of the same intricate organism. Mr. O’Connor, as a program essay by the dancer-choreographer Rashaun Mitchell informs us, reached 60 this year. My first experience of his work was 30 years ago; I’m sorry to have missed much of it since then. But it’s long been evident that his main subject is dance itself. As I see Mr. O’Connor’s pieces, though, dance is their only subject. Some choreographers make intensely formal work that seems to turn into drama or music or meaning before our eyes: It may be hard to explain how this particular pattern or step becomes a window onto something beyond dance, but we feel it with wonder. Not so with Mr. O’Connor. “Long Run” shows us these structures, these phrases, these details; if you’re interested, they’re interesting. It includes gestures and actions we can recognize from the wider world, but in a way that isolates their intrinsic qualities, as if they were scientific specimens. Like many dances today, it makes gender itself ambiguous: Same-sex and opposite-sex partnering coexist, without dramatic tension. Mr. Mitchell’s essay, however, speaks of how some O’Connor choreography expresses “the code-switching and psychic space of queer existence.” I hope to see that when I next watch an O’Connor dance. Decades ago, many pieces by George Balanchine and Merce Cunningham seemed windowless worlds to many observers, and still do to some; the meanings of Mr. O’Connor’s work may yet happen to me. So far, I admire without being drawn in.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Ages of A.R. Gurney in the Wistful ‘Final Follies’,"The last comedy completed by A. R. Gurney, who died last year, begins as so many early chapters of adult lives do — with a job interview. But the candidate in the affectingly titled “Final Follies,” at the Cherry Lane Theater, is scraping against middle age and would seem to have no viable set of skills for the 21st century. He does, however, possess the necessary attributes to anchor a Gurney play. He is well mannered, well dressed, self deprecating, confident and aimless. His name is Nelson (Colin Hanlon), and he has been without a job for a while. Nelson has previously worked briefly as an English teacher at a prep school and as a vice president at his grandfather’s bank. He plays a little squash and is currently into “some serious cross-country.” The job he is now seeking is that of an actor in “discreet adult videos which have therapeutic value.” Ah, how the once rich and mighty have fallen. Or as Nelson tells his amused interviewer, Tanisha (née Virginia, and played winningly by Rachel Nicks), “You know what we’re really taking about here …. The waning of the WASP culture.” The tribal ways and shrinking means of that culture were Gurney’s abiding subjects during a long and fecund career that began six decades ago. The three plays, early and late, that appear under the umbrella title of the latest one, “Final Follies,” allow Gurney fans a rare chance to compare the playwright at the beginning and the end of his career. They have been directed, broadly but affectionately, by David Saint in a Primary Stages production. Judging by the evidence at hand, Gurney definitely improved with age. “Final Follies,” which was finished only weeks before his death at 86, is a charming benediction and farewell to the caste whose demise he chronicled so faithfully. The other offerings, first published in the 1960s, suggest a writer still clearing his throat in the process of finding his own voice. Both “The Rape of Bunny Stuntz” (1964) and “The Love Course” (1969) show a young Gurney under the sway of the fashionable influences of a decade in upheaval. You can see bright sparks, though, of the mature dramatist in the making, as well as flashes of the trenchant wit and contemplative melancholy that would become his signature. (James Youman’s single, modernist set is transformed by Cory Pattak’s lighting to match the changing moods and times.) The “rape” of the earlier work is metaphoric, meant to evoke the violation of a dissatisfied housewife’s middle-class pieties. This infelicitously titled, Absurdist romp suggests Gurney had been reading a lot of Edward Albee, and it makes sense that it was first performed at the Cherry Lane, a Greenwich Village bastion of experimental theater. Played with a steely sweetness that suggests cotton candy spun from picture wire, Deborah Rush’s Bunny (and, yes, you may call her that) is the chairwoman of an unspecified group of unhappy people. She would bring the meeting to order if only she could open the mysterious box she says contains all her notes and agenda. But she appears to have lost the key, you see. And a sinister man in a black leather jacket, who has arrived in a red Impala, is waiting, unseen, in the shadows, claiming that he has the key. Bunny slides offstage to slap him (and be slapped), like “some cheap, second-rate blonde in a B movie,” as she puts it, adding tartly, “I’ve slipped to that level apparently.” This playlet — which features Piter Marek and Betsy Aidem in gargoylish supporting roles — is terminally of its era, with its evocation of the dark desires churning beneath a chipper Betty Crocker life. But Ms. Rush’s wry, subversively timed performance makes it worth watching. “Bunny Stuntz” is also very much of the moment in one particular detail. Defending herself against (imagined) charges of infidelity with the unseen Impala driver, Bunny says that one need only consult her engagement calendar to confirm her innocence. “Would you like to see that?” she asks defiantly. “Would that convince you that you’ve made a mistake?” It’s a moment that makes you wish that Gurney — who specialized in quick-sketch topical satires (most memorably in “Mrs. Farnsworth”) in his later career — had been around to provide his take on the newest member of the Supreme Court. A onetime teacher of literature at M.I.T., Gurney also enjoyed sending up the jargon and dogma of academia. He was already shooting arrows in that direction with “The Love Course,” in which a team of professors — Burgess (Mr. Marek) and Carroway (Ms. Aidem) — have turned their shared seminar on great romantic literature (from Plato to D. H. Lawrence) into a platonic but passionate love affair. The jokey central conceit is stretched too thin, but it allows Ms. Aidem to have an infectiously fine time as an arch self dramatizer. And Mr. Marek finds in the beleaguered, married Burgess hints of the more fully drawn, dissatisfied Gurney protagonists to come. That would include Nelson of “Final Follies,” who is ready to abandon the comfortable but fading world he has inherited. His grandfather (Greg Mullavey) and brother (Mark Junek) show up as generational exhibits of dinosaurs marking out their last days on earth. But it’s only Nelson, played by Mr. Hanlon with an easy smile and a sheepish air of entitlement, who fully realizes that his kind is now history. All he wants is to sail away toward parts unknown — preferably in a “sleek star-class yawl,” mind you. Thus does Gurney, exercising the divine omnipotence of playwrights, generously present the last of his muddled men of privilege, resigned to his extinction and poised on the edge of the eternity of the open sea.

2018,Review: The Czech Philharmonic Brings Tear-Streaked Consolation,"We tend to lean on Mahler’s “Resurrection” Symphony in moments of tragedy — in the immediate aftermath, and later in remembrance. Leonard Bernstein conducted it after John F. Kennedy was assassinated; the New York Philharmonic played it to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It comes out for triumphant occasions, too. The Czech Philharmonic, which gave two concerts at Carnegie Hall this weekend as part of its first season with Semyon Bychkov as its music director, programmed the Mahler on Sunday to observe the centennial of Czech independence from the Austrian Empire. But the symphony ended up being poignantly resonant for an entirely different reason. On Saturday, 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh were killed by a gunman. A day later, Mr. Bychkov and the Czechs were at Carnegie playing a Jewish composer’s cathartic and sweeping exploration of death and resurrection. Judging from the tears and awe-struck faces in the audience during the orchestra’s bows — following the quiet holiness and overwhelming triumph of the symphony’s finale — I wasn’t the only one who walked away with relief, however temporary, from feelings of anger, confusion and sadness. This was a testament not only to Mahler, but also to Mr. Bychkov and his orchestra. Despite some trouble among the brasses, this was a moving and intelligent reading of the “Resurrection,” dramatic in the opening and finale, sweet and playful in the inner movements, and sublime in the setting of “Urlicht,” sung by the mezzo-soprano Elisabeth Kulman. Mr. Bychkov was appointed the Philharmonic’s music director last year, following the death of Jiri Belohlavek. Although he has a substantial history with the orchestra, onstage and in recordings, there was still a question of how Mr. Bychkov, a Russian, would fare with an ensemble so closely connected with the music of its homeland. The real test came the evening before the “Resurrection” — although Czechs often claim the Bohemian-born Mahler as one of their own — when the Philharmonic presented the Cello Concerto and Seventh Symphony of Dvorak, the Czech hero and conductor of the orchestra’s inaugural concert 122 years ago. Rest assured, this is still the Czech Philharmonic of warm strings, penetrating brasses and fleet-footed danciness. But it does have a slight Russian accent under Mr. Bychkov’s direction — mainly in the drama milked from the Mahler and from Dvorak’s Brahmsian Seventh. The orchestra’s sound may be a bit more international these days, but its players are still the masters of their country’s music. And they were smart to showcase their prowess with two of Dvorak’s finest works. Opening Saturday’s concert with the Cello Concerto was almost an act of diplomacy: It’s inarguably Czech in its character, though it was written during the composer’s years in America. The soloist was the lyrical, incisive Alisa Weilerstein, who released a flawless recording of the concerto with the Czechs several years ago. Although there was a bit of push-and-pull between her and Mr. Bychkov during the opening Allegro, they eventually settled comfortably into an excellent performance that displayed just how beautifully Ms. Weilerstein can make her instrument sing, and how skillfully this nimble orchestra can deal out dances, fanfares and yearning melodies in quick succession. The year Ms. Weilerstein’s Dvorak album came out, 2014, also brought the most recent visit from the Czech Philharmonic before this weekend’s concerts. Let’s hope that, under Mr. Bychkov, we don’t have to wait another four years to hear them here again.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Disturbing Obsession of ‘The Kindergarten Teacher’,"There are very few actors who can credibly convey intellectual desperation, but Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of them. In “The Kindergarten Teacher,” a riveting remake of Nadav Lapid’s 2015 Israeli drama of the same name, she plays Lisa, a Staten Island kindergarten teacher in her 40s whose serene existence hides a gnawing hunger for a life filled with art and literature. An evening poetry-writing class only reveals her own mediocre talent, no matter how encouraging her charming instructor (Gael García Bernal). Her husband (Michael Chernus) is supportive but floored by her frustration, her teenage children buried in their own screens and schedules. Then, one day, a little boy in her class delivers, trance-like, a few lines of startlingly evocative verse. Believing him a prodigy — an awareness of the difference between poets and pretenders is both her gift and her curse — Lisa scribbles down his words as if delivered by a seer. Fluidly capturing the trajectory of a ruinous obsession, the writer and director, Sara Colangelo, skillfully fudges the line between mentoring and manipulation, and between nurturing talent and appropriating it. Suffusing each scene with an insinuating, prickly tension, she remains ruthlessly committed to her screw-tightening tone, offering the viewer no comforting moral escape hatch. And oh, do we need one, as Gyllenhaal — who is never out of our sight — somehow makes us all her accomplices, imprisoning our sympathies even when Lisa’s inappropriate behavior escalates to inexcusable. As she did so potently in Hugo Blick’s marvelous 2014 mini-series, “The Honorable Woman,” Gyllenhaal forces us to search her face for clues to motives left purposely unarticulated. “How far will she go?” we wonder, even as we fear that we already know the answer.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: The Doctor Regenerates, and So Does ‘Doctor Who’","Everything you read about Sunday’s season premiere of “Doctor Who” on BBC America will focus on the new Doctor, played by Jodie Whittaker, the first woman in the show’s five-decade succession of stars. (Like the previous 12, she’s British and white.) A woman as the Doctor is a big deal in the traditionally patriarchal, often rabidly insular world of science fiction. But as significant as the advent of Ms. Whittaker may be in cultural terms, the impact on the show is muted in Sunday’s episode (the only one provided for review). For fans of this venerable time-travel adventure — Whovians, in Whospeak — the bigger changes stem from another passing of the torch, this one man to man. And they’re not for the better. Steven Moffat, the “Doctor Who” showrunner and head writer for six seasons, has handed off those duties to Chris Chibnall. Mr. Chibnall is best known for his work on cop shows, and they’ve been good ones — he was a writer for the original “Life on Mars,” showrunner of “Law & Order: U.K.” and creator of “Broadchurch.” But he also has “Who” connections. He was the head writer of “Torchwood,” a 2006 spinoff series that was a watered-down, less invigorating version of “Doctor Who.” And based on the limited evidence of the season premiere, that’s where we are again. “Doctor Who,” whose fans gleefully obsess over 37 seasons (now 11 in the modern reboot) of internal history, tends to be a secretive enterprise. Few details have leaked about Mr. Chibnall’s plans, and the premiere screener carried an exhaustive no-spoilers plea: Don’t describe the monsters; don’t say how the Doctor arrives on the scene; don’t say where; don’t say when; don’t say who. In that spirit, what we can say is that Mr. Chibnall clears the decks. He introduces not just Ms. Whittaker (she replaces Peter Capaldi, the Doctor in the last three seasons) but also a diverse new set of potential traveling companions, one portrayed by Bradley Walsh, who played the Jerry Orbach role on “Law & Order: U.K.” There is, in comparison to recent seasons, scant reference to the show’s mythology, as if Mr. Chibnall is consciously distancing himself from it. The Tardis, the Doctor’s time-and-space ship disguised as a police box, does not appear, and there is, for all intents and purposes, no travel in either time or space. Beyond any momentary quirks, though, there are deeper changes in style and spirit that are likely to be more permanent. Mr. Moffat’s “Doctor Who” was like an hour spent hanging out with clever undergraduates whose imaginations were on overdrive, saturated in both canonical and pop culture and enamored of wordplay and brain teasers. It was frosted, sometimes too heavily, with moral dilemmas, light conundrums and the kind of romanticism associated with ancient British universities. It could leave you cold or drive you crazy, but there wasn’t much else like it on television. In Mr. Chibnall’s debut, words and ideas no longer have pride of place — the game playing is gone, along with the sharply morbid sense of humor. This “Doctor Who” feels like a lot of other TV shows, not just in its writing but in its pacing, its cinematography, its use of music. When the scary monsters appear, you could be watching any other well-made but conventional science-fiction or horror show. Or a police procedural, for that matter. Everything about the show is more ordinary, which may have to do with levels of inventiveness but also feels like a choice. Mr. Chibnall has eased off the throttle, lowering the sensations per minute. Within that context, Ms. Whittaker — who was terrific as a bereaved, angry mother on Mr. Chibnall’s “Broadchurch” — performs gamely, if not yet distinctively, as the 2,000-year-old Time Lord. It’s far too early to tell what kind of stamp she might put on the character, and in the premiere she sometimes seems to be doing an imitation of Mr. Capaldi or his predecessor Matt Smith — one thing Mr. Chibnall has carried over from Mr. Moffat is the Doctor’s clipped, telegraphic dialogue in moments of duress. But whether it’s Ms. Whittaker’s performance or Mr. Chibnall’s conception, this feels like a different Doctor — friendlier, less angsty, more of a straightforward action hero. (One thing that definitely can’t be blamed on Ms. Whittaker is the Doctor’s new costume, which — spoiler alert — recalls a certain space traveler played by a young Robin Williams.) Perhaps the most important thing about the Doctor, until now, has been his alienness, the inhuman edge that Mr. Capaldi was so good at capturing. With Ms. Whittaker, the biggest change may turn out not to be that she’s a woman, but that she’s inescapably human.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Drama ‘Sadie’ Finds a Teenager in a Tough Situation,"About half as edgy as it wants to be, “Sadie” rings true and false in equal amounts. This leads to an odd experience as you watch the talented young actress (Sophia Mitri Schloss) playing its title character: You’re likely to believe Sadie more than you believe “Sadie.” Set in and around a trailer park, this drama begins and ends in voice-over as that 13-year-old reads one of the letters she’s been writing to her father. He is serving in the military overseas and hasn’t come home in years. She longs for him to return, and her sadness is acute. Rae (Melanie Lynskey), Sadie’s mother, isn’t as eager to see him. In his absence she’s being courted by one man, Bradley (Tony Hale), and is soon sleeping with another, Cyrus (John Gallagher Jr.). Rae later falls in love with Cyrus, and tries to explain to Sadie that her marriage is likely over. That leads the girl to consider ways to take Cyrus out of the picture. Schloss wisely underplays her role. Yet Megan Griffiths, the writer and director, frequently gives her and others dialogue that’s weighed down with exposition. Images and scenes, too, can feel stagy: Sadie and a friend sometimes wander through a junkyard, seemingly for the sake of a gritty shot than for any real reason; Cyrus is often popping up at very convenient moments. Lynskey and Schloss are well matched as mother and daughter, and Griffiths builds a relationship between them as this far-from-innocent teenager navigates her world. That rough journey is worth watching even when this film falls short.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Revelatory Early Works of Lucinda Childs at MoMA,"The most marvelous revelations of the Museum of Modern Art’s “Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done” have come in the shape of live performances of works from 1961 to 1978. But the pleasure has been double-edged; an era is ending. Trisha Brown, one of the choreographers honored in this series, died last year. And this week’s performances by Lucinda Childs Dance (running through Sunday) will be that company’s final appearances. The dancers may still perform Ms. Childs’s work, and she may still make new work for them or others, but this is the last hurrah for this ensemble. I’m sad — but glad that I found myself succumbing to her choreography as never before. The audience sits on three sides of the square performing space in MoMA’s atrium. The geometries of Ms. Childs’s style would seem to encourage distance, but, to my surprise, proximity enhanced appreciation. Although she has become known for her collaborations with minimalist composers like Philip Glass and John Adams, six of the seven early works on this program are performed in silence: They are their own music. Ms. Childs became a member of the Judson Dance Theater in 1963. The dances presented here date from 1963 to 1978. (One was rearranged as a quartet in 2013.) The oldest work, “Pastime” (1963), which opens this program and is accompanied by a Philip Corner score, immediately shows her arresting and peculiar individuality. Three women are positioned across the stage in an unchanging diagonal: They might belong to three different species — or three different kinds of moving sculpture. Each stays rooted to her spot, dancing without traveling. One (Caitlin Scranton) stands upright, obdurate, rhythmically swinging a leg and even hopping while maintaining a handsome, often two-dimensional, upper-body tension. The second (Shakirah Stewart), her torso and outstretched legs encased in a jersey tube from which only her head emerges, stays seated: She looks like her own canoe. The third (Katie Dorn) spends the dance largely upended, balanced on one straight leg but with her torso plunged as if she were a flamingo. It’s an odd vision, but forceful. All three show striking technical rigor. Ms. Childs, 78 and in exceptional shape (erect, coolly composed), dances one solo, “Particular Reel” (1973), herself. Here, she crisscrosses the space, walking in a steady zigzag from one corner to another, embellishing each line of her path with slow turns, powerfully outstretched gestures and telling, momentary pauses. Her whole manner is austere: Touchingly tentative transitional moments are followed by others of complete authority as her eyes, hands and arms arrive perfectly in a completed forward gesture into the beyond. Spatial geometry is one of Ms. Childs’s enduring themes. Another is meter: You’re intensely aware of individual feet, as in verse, and of their rhythmic play in far larger units. The two coincide in her 1970s work to build a genre of startling and uncompromising minimalism. You see why she would become a like-minded choreographer — in scansion, structure and thought — for Mr. Glass. It’s seldom possible to discern the start or end of any phrase. Each dance’s current is nonstop (the pauses in her own “Particular Reel” are somewhat illusory, caesuras rather than halts), while its sense of process is constant. Each Childs composition establishes its own flight paths. The three men of “Reclining Rondo” (1975) don’t travel at all, or even stand: In one vertical line, they lie, sit, reposition themselves, in a steady rhythm. It’s fun to note how a position that looks fetal or sleeplike is followed by one of exertion or Sphinx-like fixity, but this “Rondo” is too schematic to feel like much more than a scientific experiment. The manner is entirely objective, but the steps take on their own affective qualities. Those turning leaps catch your breath; some of the rapid smaller walks touch on comedy. The program builds to the bafflingly intricate patterning and scansion of the light-footed dance quintet “Interior Drama” (1977). Five women, their insteps lively and their legs often straight, begin by advancing in a wedge shape, but the parallel vertical paths they take soon become interwoven with retreats, turns, arcs — and with metrical variations, too. Ms. Childs, known as a seminal figure of dance postmodernism, is here a child of the Renaissance. An earlier version of this article described incorrectly an early work by the choreographer Lucinda Childs. ""Pastime” is not performed in silence; it is accompanied by a Philip Corner score.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: There’s a Dark, Golden Haze in This Reclaimed ‘Oklahoma!’","Critic’s Pick BEN BRANTLEY How are your eyes this morning, Jesse? I know we both attended the same performance of Daniel Fish’s exciting interpretation of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Oklahoma!,” which opened on Sunday night at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn. And it’s not exactly a “bright golden haze” — to quote from that fabled musical’s opening number — that’s hanging over the Western plains, but a light that scorches. How did you find the view? JESSE GREEN I would call it brilliant chiaroscuro. And not just literally — though Scott Zielinski’s lighting design goes from blindingly bright, as one imagines the prairie sun to be, to dead dark, the kind that exists in the unhappiest human hearts. Both are revealed to be part of this story that for a long time has offered only midlevel Broadway glitz. BRANTLEY Very true. Mr. Fish is providing a stark illumination that allows those homesteaders we once thought were so wholesome no place to hide, even when it’s pitch dark. What’s so thrilling about this exposure of what lies beneath is that you feel it was always there, waiting to be excavated. GREEN Astonishingly, not a word has been added to Hammerstein’s book, nor any major liberties taken with the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs. Yet the whole thing feels much more intimate because of the context. Start with the staging at St. Ann’s, done up for the occasion (by the marvelous designer Laura Jellinek) like a barn for a barn dance, with glittering streamers, hot pots of chili and the audience seated at wooden tables or on risers on two sides of the action. BRANTLEY And perhaps we should mention that wall of shotguns, the presence of which registers as increasingly important — and ominous — as the show continues. GREEN Yes, a wall of guns on one side and a wall painted to depict the romantic prairie on the other. Together they throw you right into middle of the story’s archetypal conflicts: law versus freedom, enclosure versus openness, fury versus love. This has always been a very American story, of course, but has never felt like so much of one until now. Unless it was in 1943, when it opened, addressing wartime Broadway. BRANTLEY I too found myself thinking this was how the original audiences might have felt. How audacious “Oklahoma!” must have seemed — not only for the reasons every student of musicals cites about its being “organic,” with song and dance arising naturally from story — but also in its sense of untapped hormonal energy in a land where there’s the dangerous, heady sense of making up your own rules as you go along. GREEN You mentioned audacity, and mostly Mr. Fish is audacious in ways that feel dead-on and delightful. The inclusive casting as well as the picnicky aesthetic (chili and cornbread at intermission!) makes this a kind of communitarian “Oklahoma!” — something we are experiencing, and implicated in, together. Which I suppose makes it sensible for us to review it as a tag team. BRANTLEY Amen, pardner. The casting, by the way, is spot-on and often illuminating. Let’s start with Jud Fry, the resentful handyman on Laurey’s ranch. Here he’s played as a paranoid but oddly understandable stalker by Patrick Vaill, as a pale, weedy man with the kind of grudge that lands sociopaths on the front page and in prison. GREEN I’ve never seen Jud’s pathos — his need for love and his suffering as an outsider — played so richly. By stripping the production down and peeling away its assumptions, Mr. Fish is getting to the deepest fears of people who, after all, live on a frontier and on someone else’s land. In 1906, when “Oklahoma!” is set, this was Indian Territory. BRANTLEY The potential for violence that comes from being on edge in a big, borderless country is implicit throughout. The wonderful Rebecca Naomi Jones’s virginal, apprehensive Laurey is steeped in a combination of dreaminess, raw terror and independent-minded pragmatism that seems to say so much about where America was then — and is now. GREEN The production expresses that most explicitly in Laurey’s dream ballet. The choreography by John Heginbotham, as danced primarily by Gabrielle Hamilton, shocked me at first in its raw expression of Laurey’s sexual dilemma, but then I recalled how shocking the Agnes de Mille originals were said to be. I came to see this dance, at the top of Act II, as a powerful and necessary resetting of the story. BRANTLEY The show moves off the rails, for me, only later, when Mr. Fish starts to impose rather than mine from within to make his points. GREEN Would you argue that the alterations at the end are unnecessary, that the point is already made without turning Curly into an active agent of prairie justice? BRANTLEY I would. The ending has been slightly altered since I first saw this production three years ago (part of Bard SummerScape at Annandale-on-Hudson) but not enough to change the sense that it’s a bit of a cheat. The feel-bad conclusion is the most open and most facile act of rebellion on Mr. Fish’s part. GREEN And yet I understand what he was aiming for. With all its balancing of light and dark, his “Oklahoma!” is a rollicking good time: The jokes have never been funnier, the merry songs merrier. But there was no way he was going to leave us, in 2018, with an uncomplicated feeling about the workings of justice in America or about the wisdom of having formed a union from incompatible states. To that extent, I understood the crash landing he engineered. BRANTLEY Let’s shift back to what feels so fresh about the show, and so true to its source at the same time. I felt the characters owned their songs and their story in a way I’d never seen before. How did you like the music (directed by Nathan Koci, with orchestrations and arrangements by Daniel Kluger)? GREEN It was a joy to hear how beautifully Rodgers’s music adapted itself to the country sound coming from the seven musicians, who were also part of the stage community. The banjo, mandolin and steel guitar were right at home in a way that the traditional arrangements wouldn’t have been. BRANTLEY And how about the rockabilly inflections of our still adolescent-seeming Curly (a fabulous Damon Daunno). His performance conveyed the pure youth of this brave new world, with all its contradictions and energy. The same was true of our especially callow Will Parker (James Davis) and his love-the-one-you’re-with girlfriend, Ado Annie. She’s played by Ali Stroker, who turns her wheelchair into an all-conquering tool that matches her sly, vanquishing smile. Michael Nathanson is refreshingly free of stereotypical cobwebs as her sometime fiancé, a concupiscent peddler. GREEN I would just add that, for all its renovations and delicious youth, this “Oklahoma!” is also about acquiring wisdom. For me, the heart of the show is when the elderly (that is, 50-ish) Aunt Eller (Mary Testa, sharp and hilarious) consoles Laurey, and us, after the violence we have witnessed. She tells us we have to be able to handle the bitter of life or we don’t deserve the sweet. We have to be “hearty.” A good message right now. BRANTLEY Yes, except she turns out to be a less benign force than we might have expected, as the foremost avatar of prairie justice. Ms. Testa’s performance, like so many of the others here, lets us look beyond the operetta poses of yore and see a real, gritty survivor — a status that turns out to involve moral compromise. In a way, she’s the ambivalent heart of this newly energized, gloriously conflicted show. GREEN And of our tired, gloriously conflicted country.

2018,Review: Tracing ‘Plot Points in Our Sexual Development’ Without the Usual Map,"“If you’re trying to break up with me, just man up and do it.” In a play about an ordinary couple, that might be no more than a mild crack. But in “Plot Points in Our Sexual Development,” which opened on Monday at the Claire Tow Theater, it’s a game changer. Cecily, the character who angrily flings the line, is a cisgender lesbian. Theo, at whom she flings it, is a self-described “genderqueer trans person who is not a woman and is not a man, but is kind of a man, who loves lesbian jokes.” Forty minutes into an hourlong work that has, until then, seemed restrained and respectful to the point of tediousness, “man up” comes off as intensely provocative, both on the part of Cecily and on the part of the playwright, Miranda Rose Hall. It’s a phrase that acknowledges the complications of gender and sexuality as they are ever more finely sliced today — but it’s also a challenge to live beyond abstractions. The play, Ms. Hall’s first professional production, faces a similar challenge. As directed by Margot Bordelon for LCT3, it seems for most of its length to keep present-tense emotion at bay, as if in some kind of exercise or ritual. As the lights rise on the barest of stages — just two chairs, a door and a herringbone parquet — Cecily (Marianne Rendón) and Theo (Jax Jackson) are seated well apart from each other, facing straight ahead. Taking turns, they tell stories that describe, as the flat-footed title suggests, the high and mostly low moments of their sex lives to date. (This makes the characters seem adolescent, though we eventually learn that they are in their early 30s.) Preschool crushes give way to mortifying tween experiments; bad encounters to tentative self-discovery. Cecily stops trying to perform for boys just as Theo, growing up elsewhere, begins to comprehend a desire to become one. These stories feel overworked to me, amusing enough but too neat for their own good. Several describe cute juvenile sex games, including Going to Missouri, in which Cecily and her Barbie doll make mad pioneer love in matching bonnets, and Kiss Machine, in which Theo speed-smooches a set of twin boys until one somehow winds up with a black eye. The play itself is also a kind of game, though we don’t at first understand the rules or the relationship between the players. Apparently, they are not allowed to interrupt each other, nor respond directly as the memories accumulate in the space between them. It is only shortly before Cecily tells Theo to “man up” that we learn they are a couple working through a crisis by performing the play we’ve been watching. I will not spoil what the crisis is, though it’s worth noting that it is very specific to the relationship between a feminine-identified lesbian and a trans person who has always been “obsessed with” masculinity. With that specificity, and that acknowledgment of intimacy, the drama starts to percolate at last, doing what drama traditionally does: Make the feelings of others accessible to everyone. Well, maybe not everyone. Two days after I saw “Plot Points,” The New York Times reported that the Trump administration is engaged in an effort to define transgender identity out of existence by rewriting federal civil rights law. Whatever my quibbles about the overtidy construction of “Plot Points” and the narrowness of its immediate concerns, this news reminded me of why a play like this can be so important. I remembered the effect plays about gay life — good, bad, teasing, campy, hysterical or sanctimonious — had on me as a Junior Gay back when gay rights weren’t much further along than trans rights are now. One of the things theater can do is prepare the ground for the future. If that makes seeing “Plot Points” seem like farm work, it isn’t. Even when it stares hardest at its navel, it’s never less than intriguing. And Ms. Bordelon’s work shaping the pauses, as much as the words, eventually pays off. We often say of good actors in a long play that they make the time hurtle by; here, lovely performances in a short one make time slow down and give the story body. That feeling is almost literal. In both the serio-comic monologues and the intense argument that follows, Ms. Rendón physicalizes the internal conflicts of a “femmey pretty lady” who has never until meeting Theo felt she had meaningful “access” to her body. And I don’t think I’ve ever felt the joy of a trans person’s self-discovery expressed onstage as fully as Jax Jackson expresses it in a story about swimming shirtless at age 12. Transgender people deserve to see that joy onstage. And lots of other people can share the feeling by analogy. But if those aren’t sufficient reasons to welcome “Plot Points” to the theater, there’s always this: It would outrage people worth outraging.

2018,"Review: Two Chamber Concerts, One Sparkling, One Depressing","Europe is dotted with small museums devoted to the early lives of cultural icons. Step inside any of them and you are invited to gaze at vitrines containing humble objects once touched by the future luminary. You do your best to extract meaning from the odd inkwell or hairbrush, but too often the banality of the material defeats you. I felt similarly despondent on Tuesday at Alice Tully Hall, during much of the season-opening concert of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Called “Russian Inspiration,” it was sold as a teaser for the society’s Russian-theme festival next March. But save for an eight-minute set of piano variations by Glinka, it contained no Russian music. Instead it promised a survey of the kind of Western fare imported and coveted in the 19th century — the sounds that sparked a backlash of desire for a homegrown tradition. That’s how the 49-year-old society opened with the Duo in G for two violins by Giovanni Battista Viotti, a work so underwhelming that it can only have inspired budding composers by setting the bar low. Benjamin Beilman and Ida Kavafian executed it with brilliant tone and a heroic determination to find drama in its contrasting textures. Mr. Beilman, with the limpid pianist Gloria Chien, was also impressive in Liszt’s Grand Duo Concertant for violin and piano on a theme by Charles Philippe Lafont, a French violinist who spent time in Russia. If the Viotti duet was an example of music for domestic consumption, this one came out of the commercial stunt mill of touring virtuosos. John Field was an Irish pianist who was particularly praised in St. Petersburg for his nocturnes, dreamy miniatures. Ms. Chien played the Nocturne No. 2 with singing tone, but could not hide the lack of depth underneath its decorous lyricism. Listeners were also treated to a charming rendition of Mozart’s playful Andante and Five Variations in G for piano, four hands, with Michael Brown joining Ms. Chien. And Mr. Brown’s reading of Glinka’s variations on a Mozart theme was a highlight by the sheer force of his playing, his sound gently radiant. With such modest competition, Schumann’s Piano Quartet in E flat should have easily carried the evening. (The tenuous connection offered is Clara Schumann, who made it to Russia on two concert tours.) But this war horse has received more exciting outings at the society; here it was redeemed mostly by Mr. Brown’s playing and the cello solos of David Requiro, a highly welcome new addition to the society’s roster. The question of musical influence also shaped the Israeli Chamber Project’s concert on Thursday at Merkin Concert Hall. This time, though, the program was riveting and intelligently conceived, with a rarity at its dramatic center that made you want to rush home and discover more. The theme was Debussy, who died 100 years ago. The program examined the way elements of his style — open-ended melodies, harmonic ambiguity, and the dissolution of rhythmic conventions — filtered into French music of the 1920s. The Israeli Chamber Project, now celebrating its 10th anniversary, has always kept an eye out for musical oddities, in part to accommodate its members. These include, along with the incisive pianist Assaff Weisman and a handful of excellent string players, the clarinetist Tibi Cziger and Sivan Magen, a harpist of astonishing range. The program opened with Mr. Magen’s arrangement for clarinet and harp of Debussy’s “Première Rhapsodie,” a textbook Impressionist fantasy completed in 1910 and performed here with a magnetic sense of flow. It was followed by Carlos Salzedo’s Sonata for Harp and Piano, a work of bracing originality and energy written in 1922. Salzedo was a virtuoso on both these instruments, but built his career as a harpist and teacher of wide-reaching influence. In this sonata teeming with modernist impulses, he calls for a brilliant palette of sounds often created through specific gestures. (His techniques were influenced by the choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, with whom he was friendly.) Fauré’s Trio for Clarinet, Cello and Piano seemed more traditional-minded, but with the material developed through subtle harmonic changes and rhythmic displacement. The guest cellist Peter Wiley joined Mr. Cziger and Mr. Weisman for a luscious performance. In Ravel’s Sonata for Violin and Cello, the rhythmic experiments are much bolder. Mr. Wiley and the robust-toned violinist Carmit Zori brought out its competitive zest. The evening ended with Debussy’s Piano Trio in G from 1880, a melody-focused work from a time before Claude sounded like Debussy. But here, at last, was a relic from a genius’s early life that left you feeling illuminated.",The New York Times
2018,Review: William Forsythe Brings Baroque Dance and B-Boy Moves Together,"LONDON — Making dance without music is nothing new: Choreographers as varied as Mary Wigman, Jerome Robbins, Twyla Tharp and Emanuel Gat have created works in which the only sounds are the dancers’ breath and footfalls. Yet William Forsythe, still one of our most pioneering dance makers at 68, believes there’s a contemporary virtue to quietness in the current political and media climate. In “A Quiet Evening of Dance,” a program of new and newish material by Mr. Forsythe that runs at Sadler’s Wells through Saturday, two of Mr. Forsythe’s works are performed entirely in silence, and all five are choreographed with an intimacy that demands a very special kind of attention. There’s another connecting thread to the evening. For decades, Mr. Forsythe has been stretching his relationship with ballet to the limit: fracturing its grammar, forcing it to extremes of balance and speed. But lately, classical ballet seems to have reclaimed his heart. If “A Quiet Evening of Dance” is a celebration of small details, it also embodies Mr. Forsythe’s very personal exploration of the art form’s past, rooted in the baroque dances of European royal courts. Typically, that journey is oblique, witty and rich in surprise. The evening opens with “Prologue,” a bright and impish courtly duet danced by Parvaneh Scharafali and Ander Zabala. Wearing pale blue evening gloves along with their rehearsal sweats, stepping high on the balls of their sneaker-shod feet, the couple circle, gesture and bow, responding to some silent music that only they can hear behind the vestigial sound of bird song accompanying the piece The elegant language of “Prologue” helps us deduce the logic of the next work, “Catalogue.” At first, the dancers Jill Johnson and Christopher Roman seem to be locked in a workmanlike and very un-balletic exchange of moves. Dancing in total silence, they fold and unfold their arms, squat, lunge and swivel their hands. Yet as our eyes adjust, this seemingly pedestrian exercise reveals itself as a clever, quick-fire demonstration of ballet’s basic elements. The dancers’ arms curve and, their torsos twist into classical shapes, and as their legs rotate outward, recognizable steps begin to appear — a shimmer of a “pas de chat,” the stately lines of an arabesque — as though Mr. Forsythe were riffling through the pages of a ballet master’s text book. Variations and embellishments of these moves recur in “Epilogue,” where the four dancers perform to the spare piano music of Morton Feldman. The choreography here is more tightly wrought and more spatially wide-ranging around the stage. And it comes charged with the brilliantly rogue element of a fifth performer, the virtuoso street dancer Rauf Yasit, who is known as RubberLegz. Mr. Forsythe has been working with Mr. Yasit since 2017, exploring the connections between hip-hop and ballet, and here he shows us tantalizing glimpses of that relationship. When Mr. Yasit dances the same material as the others, he brings to it a mesmerizing elasticity (it’s clear how he earned his street moniker). But better yet is the genius with which he appropriates spiraling configurations of the classical dancer’s arms and transforms them into B-Boy moves, knotting and unknotting his limbs with miraculous fluidity and speed. Purely in terms of theatrical momentum, Mr. Forsythe may have miscalculated in adding yet another work to the program’s long opening half: “Dialogue.” The work is actually one of his finest and it is beautifully danced by Riley Watts and Brigel Gjoka. An intricate construct of sharply articulated footwork, runs and leaps, the choreography flips between steady, symmetrical phrases, woozy slow motion and accelerated flurries. But it suffers from being too close in style and scale to the preceding works. It’s with the audience’s eyes and ears refreshed by an intermission that the final work, “Seventeen/Twenty One,” takes magisterial command of the stage. Set to music by Rameau, all seven dancers unite for the work, which features variations on the vocabulary introduced in the first half, but with a more performative and music-inspired flourish. There’s a virtuoso male trio of circling floor patterns and arrowy jumps, and a quietly hilarious duet for Mr. Roman and Ms. Johnson, in which he dances with the ineffable, almost pained refinement of an 18th-century courtier while she casually shadows him in a mocking baseball cap. Within the tight structure of the work, Mr. Yasit, too, is allowed a flash of street dance brilliance, an exploding puzzle of shoulder spins and body locking, so fast you can’t believe your eyes. “Seventeen/Twenty One” is a humdinger of a work, but it is one whose brilliance Mr. Forsythe has deliberately primed us to see through the quiet rigors of the preceding works.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: With ‘Tao,’ Philharmonic Dives Deeper Into Andriessen","In writing his 1996 work “Tao,” the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen says he made no attempt “to relate to what is known as ‘music from the Far East’ or, even worse, ‘world music.’” I can understand his reluctance. There have probably been too many glib generalizations about what Asian music is, and too many attempts to appropriate it. Still, listening to the New York Philharmonic’s performance of “Tao” on Wednesday at David Geffen Hall, with David Robertson conducting, it was hard not to hear the piercing, high-pitched chords and tart melodic fragments of this 18-minute work as evocative of Asian styles and sonorities. And the scoring for “Tao” does include two traditional Japanese instruments; in the second half, four female vocalists sing settings of Chinese and Japanese texts. “Tao,” the middle piece in Mr. Andriessen’s hourlong “Trilogy of the Last Day,” explores the passage of time — in life and in music — and how we live under the shadow of fate. It begins with what seems a disorienting call to attention: thin, reedy chords, sometimes sustained and sometimes slippery, are played in high registers by woodwinds and percussion. When the violins and cellos enter, those instruments at first also play high, scratchy sounds. Clipped melodies, like bits of chant, keep breaking through. Eventually the lower strings provide depth and grounding, fortified by snarling brass. Whatever narratives or cultural traditions the music evokes in you, the pungent, precise harmonies are the result of the acute ear this composer brings to all his music, as we are learning from the Philharmonic’s two-week series “The Art of Andriessen.” About halfway through “Tao,” the vocal quartet — here the excellent Synergy Vocals — enters, singing an excerpt from the sixth century B.C. “Tao Te Ching,” the message of which is stated in the first line: “When one is out of life, one is in death.” The second text, Kotaro Takamura’s 1930 poem “Knife-Whetter,” describes in poignant detail how a craftsman finds purpose by honing a skill. Around this point a piano soloist (here Tomoko Mukaiyama) enters, playing fitful strands of steely high chords. Ms. Mukaiyama also performed in the premiere of the work, which was conceived for her multiple talents. After dispatching a final flourish on the piano, she walked as if in a trance to a nearby koto (a Japanese zither), and began plucking delicate melodic lines. She also intoned and, in a tender voice, sang Mr. Andriessen’s settings of the texts. Following “Tao,” the orchestra was joined by the brilliant pianist Garrick Ohlsson for Rachmaninoff’s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, a vigorous, crisp and clear performance without a trace of Romantic excess. The program ended with a strikingly fresh account of Sibelius’s popular Second Symphony. Mr. Robertson drew out the music’s misty colorings and hints of Finnish folk song, while emphasizing the visionary elements of this 1902 score, especially its structural daring, full of startling disruptions to the music’s flow.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Wrestling With a Master in ‘On Beckett’,"When Bill Irwin talks about how the language of Samuel Beckett “has gone viral,” he becomes a walking, writhing index of a contagion’s symptoms. This is a grave and incurable condition in which the human body is at war with itself, its mind and the inescapable forces of gravity. So on the stage of the Irish Repertory Theater, where Mr. Irwin’s captivating “On Beckett” opened on Wednesday night, you will find a terminally possessed creature speaking in contradictory utterances as seemingly involuntary as hiccups. And shrinking and growing like Lewis Carroll’s Alice after drinking a Wonderland elixir. And melting into asymmetry, like a waxwork in a fire. You can’t help pitying that suffering soul and — shame on you — laughing at him. You may also recognize, whether you want to admit it or not, your own infinitely divided self. Whatever virus has taken over Mr. Irwin, you know on some level that you, too, carry it in your bloodstream and have since the day you were born. This skillful demonstration of the disease known as being alive, as diagnosed by a master playwright, is one I would recommend to any actor, student of literature or fan of tragedy and comedy. “On Beckett,” which was conceived and staged by Mr. Irwin as an (almost) one-man show, carefully peels back the skin on an actor’s fascination with, and interpretation of, its title subject. In doing so, the show illuminates the notoriously opaque writings of Beckett without ever betraying their ineffable heart. In like manner, Mr. Irwin opens up his bag of performer’s tricks and even spills them out for our inspection. But when these discrete elements coalesce into a moment of radiant, living theater, you still find yourself thinking: “How does he do that?” It’s a reminder of a crucial paradox of great art, in which precise craft becomes a vehicle for profound mystery. Mr. Irwin is an unusually amphibious stage star, equally skilled as a professional classic clown and an intense dramatic actor. He has won Tony Awards for both the commedia dell’arte frolic “Fool Moon” (with David Shiner) and for playing the embittered George in a 2005 revival of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Such a dichotomous nature proves handy in the consideration of Beckett, whose creative lineage embraces not only the literary convolutions of his onetime employer James Joyce but also the pratfalls of vaudeville. Mr. Irwin, in earlier appearances in Beckett works — including stage adaptations of the prose pieces “Texts for Nothing” and two high-profile incarnations of the monumental “Waiting for Godot” — has affirmed how closely linked these two sides are. Here, he returns to “Texts” — dense, elliptical meditations in which raw, swirling consciousness is given argumentative voice — performing excerpts from them and the Beckett novels “The Unnamable” and “Watt.” He also takes on roles from “Godot” (assisted by the show’s only other cast member, the open-faced, 14-year-old Finn O’Sullivan). And while the program promises a vignette from Beckett’s “Endgame,” Mr. Irwin says he has since decided not to tackle that Goliath. Even with that omission, this is a replete bill of fare, filled with perceptive and appealingly humble observations on bringing Beckett’s language to life. Mr. Irwin speaks of subjects as diverse and interrelated as the pronunciation of “Godot,” Beckett’s Irishness, his “sensitivity to violence,” and the “mobility” of the pronouns he uses, turning self into splinters. There are showbiz anecdotes as well, accounts of working with actors like Nathan Lane and Robin Williams (in two different versions of “Godot”), as well as the directors Joseph Chaikin and Mike Nichols, whose voices Mr. Irwin channels in quicksilver impressions. But the crux of the show — designed by Charlie Corcoran (the spare, geometric set) and Michael Gottlieb (the mutable lighting) — is Mr. Irwin becoming a receptacle for the holy, and unholy, spirit of Beckett. His delivery early in the show of a fragment from “Texts for Nothing, #1” is a taut internal dialogue, a tower of Babel within a single mind. What follows becomes increasingly physical, as Mr. Irwin introduces props including a cane, variations on the bowler hat, bow ties, an unruly microphone and a mortar board. These are the tools of the pantomime funny man. But Mr. Irwin has always been expert in reminding us that the abiding appeal of silent clowns like Chaplin and Keaton is rooted in existential exasperation. As he says, “The word existentialism tends to put us to sleep — but questions of being — of survival — keep us awake.” And what an obstacle course it is, Beckett’s rutted path from womb to tomb. His physical world, with help from the unwieldy instrument known as the human body, trips up its inhabitant at every step. Small wonder that moving even an inch becomes a battle against inertia. Mr. Irwin traces this wrestling match with physical exactitude, pointing out that Beckett was “a writer acutely attuned to silhouette.” In this sense, angles make the man — watch Mr. Irwin instantly assume a burden worthy of Atlas with drooping shoulders and buckling knees — but so do clothes. Putting on baggy pants, he says, “taps into some cultural memory — in your eye, in my legs.” He shows us what he means, by trying to ascend a simple, low platform, which suddenly seems determined to thwart him. At a certain point, you come to see Mr. Irwin’s own shifting struggle with the elusiveness of Beckett’s language as a noble subset of that writer’s broader sense of the tragic human comedy, its Sisyphean “toil and play.” Those are the words that conclude the first “Text,” from a passage that Mr. Irwin savors. “Among other things,” he says, “they seem like a perfect definition for working in the theater: so much talking, so much listening — that’s what we do here — so much toil and play.” The toil, according to Beckett, may be tedious and futile. But Mr. Irwin also gives us the pure, energizing joy in the playing of it. This information was last updated on Sept. 27, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Yuja Wang Makes a Case for the Piano as Percussion,"Look up “Is the piano a percussion or string instrument?” online, and you’ll find an irreconcilable series of arguments for either side. But on Friday night, the pianist Yuja Wang, in the first of her six Perspectives series concerts at Carnegie Hall this season, made a clear argument for the instrument as percussion: a versatile, but ultimately mechanical, contraption that makes music from hammers striking strings. Her concert — an evening of works, some familiar and others much less so, arranged for only piano and percussion — was also a declaration that she would exploit the Perspectives platform to show New York City just what she was capable of beyond war-horse concertos and reliably impressive solo recitals. What she is more than capable of, it turns out, is ceding the stage to other musicians. Despite all the attention Ms. Wang gets for pyrotechnic virtuosity and, I have to say, bold fashion, she is a remarkably unpretentious partner when she plays with peers like the violinist Leonidas Kavakos (they will share a Carnegie recital in February) and, in the case of Friday, the percussionist Martin Grubinger. The lanky Mr. Grubinger, an Austrian virtuoso who was brilliantly athletic in John Corigliano’s percussion concerto “Conjurer” with the New York Philharmonic in 2016, shared billing with Ms. Wang in the Carnegie program, and commanded the stage with equal authority. He wields four mallets with such speed they tend to blur; yet his articulation couldn’t be clearer. Neither he nor Ms. Wang seemed to drop a note all night. Joining them were three additional percussionists — including Mr. Grubinger’s father, Martin Grubinger Sr., who had arranged the four works on Friday’s program in ways that cleverly retained their musical integrity while drawing out the vibrantly percussive spirit at the heart of each piece. His arrangements were particularly revelatory in two of the evening’s most famous works: Bartok’s Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, and Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring.” The Bartok, missing one piano, was no less melodic. Yet its intricate, varied rhythms were more exposed and amplified, and altogether electrifying. Ms. Wang, hammering ostinato chords with immense force that belied her small frame, didn’t have the look of a soloist with accompaniment, but of a percussionist among others in an ensemble. And the Stravinsky, stripped of its full orchestra, was more grounded and ritualistic than I’ve ever heard it. What a breath of fresh air this was in a season unusually saturated with the ballet score: Where the New York Philharmonic’s “Rite” in September was labored and unmenacing, this one was terrifying and ultimately more reflective of the primitive, sacrificial dance. Ms. Wang, a mighty substitute for the work’s string instruments, demonstrated how the piece has always used violins as thinly veiled percussion. Weighty and climactic, “Rite” often closes programs for a reason. So it was unfortunate that it didn’t on Friday. Rather, the concert continued, awkwardly, with Arturo Márquez’s 10-minute “Danzón No. 2,” comparatively lighter fare with tango rhythms and crowd-pleasing color. But that was just one flaw in a daring and declarative evening that ultimately bodes well for Ms. Wang’s remaining Perspectives concerts. There will be standard repertory (a Prokofiev piano concerto, a Rachmaninoff chamber work), but also opportunities to push the boundaries of piano programming. If Friday seemed at all adventurous, just wait until she returns in February for an anything-goes romp with the classical music comedy duo Igudesman & Joo.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘A Crooked Somebody’ Finds a Con Man Caught Up in His Own Plan,"Often uncomfortable and all the better for it, “A Crooked Somebody” doesn’t mind watching its characters squirm a little. That’s tough for them but good for us in this highly enjoyable thriller. “Crooked” opens at a cheap hotel banquet room where Michael (Rich Sommer), who bills himself as a psychic, is telling his dupes tales of their dead loved ones. Michael is a disappointment to himself, to his cohort (Joanne Froggatt) and to his parents (Ed Harris and Amy Madigan). But not to Nathan (Clifton Collins Jr.), an audience member who once murdered a man and believes that Michael has the power to see what he did. You don’t need clairvoyance to know that Michael and Nathan will cross paths. When they do, Michael hits upon a new con game. That scheme soon requires fresh crimes to cover old ones. To reveal more would spoil the fun of Andrew Zilch’s script and Trevor White’s direction. Mr. White has cited the Coen brothers as inspirations, and it shows. Several quirky choices and offbeat moments dot the film, as does some bitter humor. While it’s tempting to wonder what a more noirish style might have produced, Mr. White’s approach pays off well enough here. He’s aided by Mr. Sommer’s boyish expressions, which barely disguise an oily ambition, and by Mr. Collins’s skill in boosting the tension. Mr. White smartly puts the plot first. Yet a few messages are thrown into the mix. “It’s better to be an honest nobody than a crooked somebody,” declares Michael’s father. Well, that depends. If you’re looking for a friend, the first should do. But in this film, the second kind of person makes for a livelier story.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘A Star Is Born’ Brings Gorgeous Heartbreak,"“A Star Is Born” is such a great Hollywood myth that it’s no wonder Hollywood keeps telling it. Whatever the era, the director or the headliners, it relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man who’s furiously racing to the bottom (Bradley Cooper in this movie) and a woman (Lady Gaga) who’s soaring to the top. This latest and fourth version is a gorgeous heartbreaker (bring tissues). Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it’s also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better. [Read our updates on the 2019 Golden Globes and see the surprises and snubs.] Like the last iteration, the epically (empirically!) terrible 1976 remake with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, the new one takes place in a contemporary music world that is by turns exciting, suffocating and crowded with dangers — ravenous fans, crushing performance demands, celebrity itself. This is the world that has helped create and come close to ruining Jackson Maine (Mr. Cooper), a country-rock musician who, when the movie opens, is performing obviously wasted, leaning and nearly falling into a boot-stomping song. He’s a beautiful ruin adrift on an ocean of booze, one he routinely spikes with pills. A singer with a voice that can thunder, Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) becomes Jack’s safe harbor, taking on the roles of lover, partner, muse, ideal. That’s a heavy burden, but Ally is one of life’s chin-up survivors, with an errant mother and a loving, larger-than-life father, Lorenzo (a terrific Andrew Dice Clay), whose dreams cloud her own. Dad runs a limo business out of their Los Angeles home, where his male colleagues (Barry Shabaka Henley, among others) and their boisterous camaraderie fill the rooms, both warming and crowding them. Ally is accustomed to navigating around men larger than she is, elbowing past them to be seen and heard. She and Jack first meet late one night in a Hollywood drag club where she sings after her waitress shift ends. Jack has just finished playing a concert and, after polishing off a bottle of booze, has stumbled into the club for more. There he watches Ally belt out the Edith Piaf standard “La Vie en Rose,” in a sheath and upsweep, her arched artificial brows adding quizzical punctuation to her face. In a swoon, he invites her out that night, and, as flirtation gives way to deeper feelings, they fall in love. He brings Ally onstage and then on tour, but she eventually goes solo, becoming a star whose ascent is shadowed by his decline. [Read about “A Star Is Born” and male sacrifice.] Mr. Cooper, who also directed, does a lot right in this take on “A Star Is Born,” beginning with the casting of Lady Gaga, whose disarming, naturalistic presence is crucial to the movie’s force. A post-Madonna pop artist known for her elaborate stagecraft and costumes, she has been stripped down here, her mask removed. You can see her skin, the flutter in her veins, which brings you close to her, and can make both the actress and her character feel touchingly vulnerable. This unmasking of Lady Gaga also makes Ally seem genuine, authentic, a quality that the movie champions and that serves as a kind of thematic first principle. Soon after Jack and Ally meet, he peels off one of her fake brows — he’s flirting, but he’s also saying that he sees the real her and wants the world to as well. Playful yet unapologetically earnest, this scene inaugurates a seduction — of Ally, of us — that lasts the exhilarating first hour. Mr. Cooper understands the power of big-screen myths, including thunderstruck love and near-magical lucky breaks. He also understands his own star appeal (he gives himself plenty of heat-stoking close-ups), which dovetails with his role as director. When Ally and Jack look at each other, you’re watching two people fall in love, and it’s a contact high. You’re also watching a director guiding — creating — his star as life seeps into fiction. Mr. Cooper’s smartest decision, other than casting Lady Gaga, is the absolute sincerity with which he’s taken on this material, in all its gorgeous, gaudy excess. He has refurbished the story some and added a bit too much psychological filler, but he has stayed true to its fundamental seriousness. Winking at this story would have been easy, but would have destroyed it. Instead, working from a script he wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, Mr. Cooper has gone all in with big emotions and cascades of tears. (The movie owes a debt to, and nods at, the original 1937 film as well as the 1954 remake with a peerless Judy Garland.) Part of what’s exciting about this “A Star Is Born” is that Mr. Cooper knows he’s telling one of the defining Hollywood stories and has given the movie the polish and scale it merits. He plays with intimacy and cinematic sweep, going in close when Ally and Jack are together so that the world falls away — a scene of them in a parking lot shows how conversation turns to courtship — only to then pull back so we can see the enormity of the world the lovers inhabit once Jack takes Ally on tour. And while the crowd seems little more than a surging blur the first time Jack plays, when Ally looks at the throng, she sees it and so do we. [Seen “A Star Is Born”? Read Kyle Buchanan’s take, with spoilers] The concert scenes of Jack and Ally performing are revved up but personal. (The production borrowed crowds from actual music festivals like Coachella, and their sheer size conveys the scope of Jack’s stardom.) Mr. Cooper sings pleasantly enough and throttles an electric guitar with persuasive fervor. He’s backed by the group Lukas Nelson & the Promise of the Real (Lukas’s dad is Willie Nelson). The music mixes standards with new songs, some written by Mr. Cooper, Lukas Nelson and Lady Gaga, whose supple, often electric singing can, at full throttle, express intensities of feeling far better than the dialogue. Like many filmmakers, Mr. Cooper sometimes explains too much. It isn’t enough that Jack drinks; Mr. Cooper wants us to know why. So, he fleshes out Jack’s past, turning melodrama into therapy and robbing the character of mystery. One of the weakest scenes, a violent confrontation between Jack and his much-older brother, Bobby (Sam Elliott, whose deep drawl Mr. Cooper has borrowed), is an information dump. In one of the finest, Bobby just wordlessly drives away from Jack, and Mr. Elliott lets you see the ferocity of the brothers’ love — and their pain — in eyes that have begun to water and in a stone face that will shatter. Mr. Cooper spends more time on the story’s male lead than previous iterations have, perhaps because he’s taken the role himself. The focus on Jack — he scrapes bottom, goes into recovery — somewhat weighs down the remainder of the movie, partly because too much of it is overly familiar. At times, Mr. Cooper seems to share Jack’s unease with Ally’s stardom, particularly after she connects with a manager (Rafi Gavron, oozing sleaze) and transforms from a soulful crooner into a writhing automaton with soulless beats and backup singers. Ally puts on the mask that Mr. Cooper has removed from Lady Gaga, suggesting that — unlike Jack’s — her art is less than pure. Male self-aggrandizement is baked into the story’s foundation but not ruinously. Jack doesn’t just help turn Ally into a star, giving her the big break she needs. His trauma — she’s insecure, but he’s damaged — becomes a deep well that she draws from, allowing her to become a greater artist. In part, the story is as creaky as that of Pygmalion, the male sculptor who turns a beloved carving into a woman. Yet one of the pleasures of “A Star Is Born” in all its renditions is that it is also about a woman whose ambitions are equal to those of any man and who steadily rises as she weeps and sings toward fabulous self and sovereignty.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Above and Beyond,’ a Heartening Salute to NASA","The director Rory Kennedy has a personal connection to the subject of her latest documentary. “Above and Beyond: NASA’s Journey to Tomorrow” is a 60th-anniversary celebration of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration — NASA, that is. While the agency was founded during the Eisenhower administration, it was President John F. Kennedy, Ms. Kennedy’s uncle (the filmmaker is the daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy), who defined NASA’s mission for the better part of a generation by instructing it to set its sights on a manned mission to Earth’s moon. NASA put man on the moon for the first time in 1969, via Apollo 11, and that landing brought the world together in a way those who witnessed it swear had never happened before or since. This is just one of the achievements chronicled in “Above and Beyond,” which Ms. Kennedy also narrates. Featuring contributions from assorted NASA scientists and historians, the movie considers space missions less as vehicles for human adventure — though its treatments of several NASA missions that resulted in loss of human life is sensitive — than as explorations of what’s out there. And specifically, the question of whether there’s another planet that can sustain something like human life. Illustrations from covers of 1950s pulp magazines shown here remind the viewer of human hopes to someday colonize Venus or Mars, planets that NASA’s crafts and instruments found to be “too hot, too cratered, with bad atmosphere,” as one scientist puts it. The film also shows how the space agency looks out for life here on Earth, monitoring from the sky the health of our coral reef ecosystems. This is not a spectacular picture, but it’s an informative and heartening one that might make a good double feature with “First Man,” the forthcoming fictionalized blockbuster about Apollo 11.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘All American’ Can’t Quite Find the End Zone,"A hybrid of “The O.C.” and “Friday Night Lights” should be a bonanza of teen-show riches, of high stakes and fancy parties and big crunchy tackle sounds, of father figures and shy romances. Two different characters say “Welcome to Beverly Hills” in one episode — this, too, should be teen-show manna. The new CW football drama “All American” can’t seem to capitalize on all this, though, and instead winds up feeling more like a commercial for a show than an actual show itself. Spencer James (Daniel Ezra) is a smart and talented football player doing his best in South Crenshaw when Coach Billy Baker (Taye Diggs) recruits him to come play for Beverly Hills High instead. Spencer’s hesitant at first, but we all know this is what the show is going to be about, so he winds up moving in with the coach, his wife, Laura (Monet Mazur), and their two children: Olivia (Samantha Logan), the school outcast thanks to a pill addiction and trip to rehab; and Jordan (Michael Evans Behling), Spencer’s teammate and rival on and off the field. So far, so fraught. But there’s no spark here, no big moment and most egregiously, no authenticity. There’s a flat phoniness to all the behavior, and a patness to everything. It will shock no one to learn there is also a rich, white jerk football player who resents Spencer joining the team — and hey, why is his girlfriend Leila (Greta Onieogou) so interested in Spencer, too? The friction between Jordan and Spencer comes and goes awfully quickly, and the seeming love triangle between Olivia, Leila and Spencer lacks any romantic sizzle. The most interesting character is Spencer’s friend Coop (Bre-Z), a young lesbian facing harassment at school and at home. Unfortunately, Coop is also the most ancillary character, part of Spencer’s Crenshaw past and largely unconnected to the engine of the story. Unless she is also going to start playing football at Beverly Hills High (please God, that would rule), it’s hard to see how her arc fits into the show’s long-term story. “Friday Night Lights” isn’t really about football; it’s about American manhood. “All American” isn’t really about football either; in the three episodes made available for review, it’s poking around ideas about race and occasionally class. Spencer endures both overt racist taunts and not-so-micro micro aggressions, and in the third episode he and Jordan face police harassment. Still, the stories feel stale and have been told far better elsewhere. In addition to its fish-out-of-water tale and football saga, “All American” also includes a family-secrets dimension. There’s nothing wrong with a mystery, per se, but keeping a secret is less interesting than spilling one. Over and over, “All American” goes for the less interesting story. At what’s supposed to be the emotional fulcrum of the pilot, Spencer confesses to Coach Baker that he’s angry all the time — angry that his father abandoned him, angry that he’s grown up in poverty, angry that he’s had to work so much harder than other kids. But he doesn’t seem angry; he just seems bummed out. Coach Baker tells him that they’re alike, but actually, they don’t ever seem alike. The emotional sterility of the scenes between coach and player, between father-figure and son, is jarring. It’s like expecting muffins and receiving matzo. More so than good adult dramas, good teen dramas tend to have excellent pilots. The world is a confusing place to be a teenager, and thus it requires more explanations, which means the onerous exposition that bogs down other shows feels more natural and acceptable. Adolescence is itself a state of crisis, so emotions always run high, and life-impacting decisions really are around every corner. Teen shows automatically get to be more direct and more potent. It’s not that “All American” is so bad, but its mediocrity reflects an inability to capitalize on so much potential.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Bikini Moon’ Finds a Documentary Crew Under Its Subject’s Spell,"Whether you walk out halfway through “Bikini Moon” or stay to watch it twice — and both are valid reactions to this film — you’ll suspect that Milcho Manchevski, the director, will be pleased. He’s made a movie to provoke you. The tale opens at a homeless center in New York City, where a documentary crew led by Trevor (Will Janowitz) and Kate (Sarah Goldberg) is filming. They happen upon Bikini (Condola Rashad), an Iraq War veteran whose bipolar mania can turn her from transfixing to terrifying in a flash. She’s a mesmerizing subject, and with her permission the crew follows her. They quickly cross ethical lines in pursuit of her story, and wildly manipulate the “reality” of her life. We see events both in front of and behind the camera, and it soon becomes hard to tell which is more “authentic.” To write about Manchevski’s film is to use extra quote marks. The director doesn’t stick to a single genre, not when there are so many to sample. “Bikini” is parts mockumentary, satire, dark drama and, in at least one scene, bizarre fantasy. Often, the exceptional cast saves the project from exhaustion. Rashad is a loose cannon, intense enough to blast you apart yet tender enough to help patch you back together. It’s a powerhouse performance. Goldberg is exasperating in just the right ways as a bleeding heart whose capacity for forgiveness seems maddeningly endless. “Bikini Moon” is better in separate scenes than as a whole, where Manchevski’s overreaches and plot lapses become more glaring. In this film, the harshest truths — make that “truths” — are best served in small doses.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Bodyguard’ on Netflix, Britain’s Biggest TV Hit in Years","The British writer Jed Mercurio builds television shows the way the Cenobites build puzzle boxes in the “Hellraiser” movies. Get too close to one, and its intricate mechanism shoots its hooks into you, pulling you through a portal into a gyre of suspense from which there’s no escape. Mercurio’s most successful medium is a mash-up of the police procedural and the political conspiracy thriller, and his storytelling trademarks include severe psychological duress, inappropriate sex among public servants and the ease with which major characters are killed off. Most noticeably, he strives to keep every conspiratorial option open and every possible suspect in play for as long as possible. There are definite heroes and villains, but you might not know which is which until just before the final credits. The latest example of his infernal abilities is “Bodyguard,” a six-episode BBC potboiler whose finale was, according to different measurements, the highest-rated British drama since either the “Downton Abbey” Season 2 finale in 2011 or a “Doctor Who” Christmas special in 2008. Viewers in the rest of the world, including the United States, can see what the fuss is about when the series comes to Netflix on Wednesday. (A second season has not been announced but seems inevitable.) “Bodyguard” stars Richard Madden, who played the sad, short-lived Robb Stark on “Game of Thrones,” as David Budd, a war veteran now serving in a police unit that provides protection details. A long, tense, highly effective opening scene involving a suicide bomber on a train establishes Budd’s bona fides — he’s capable and compassionate in a crisis, but he’s got a twitch, a crack in his armor presumably caused by post-traumatic stress and associated problems with his marriage. That vein of weakness is central to the progress of the plot and to the web of suspicions that engulf Budd after he’s promoted to head of security for the home secretary, Julia Montague. (She’s played by Keeley Hawes, a mainstay of British TV who appeared in Mercurio’s hit series “Line of Duty.”) The hawkish, ruthlessly ambitious Montague is a target, or perhaps the target is Budd, or someone else, but in any case the threat levels are through the roof. There are bomb vests, truck bombs, regular bombs and a conspiratorial stew pitting the police, the security services and the government against one another, and all against Budd. As in “Line of Duty,” which follows a police internal-affairs unit, Mercurio is concerned with the revelation of character under pressure. But in “Bodyguard” he hasn’t done the work of building a credible character before putting it through the wringer. Budd is hazily sketched, and the extreme measures the story takes to extend its mystery and keep his motives in question have the effect of making it hard to really care about him until the season is almost up. Stuck with this cipher of a role — he’s stress personified — Madden gives a performance that’s alternately robotic and slightly unhinged. Unlike Martin Compston, who plays a comparable character in “Line of Duty,” or Lennie James, who was excellent as the villain in that show’s first season, Madden doesn’t do enough to distract us when Mercurio’s plot twists veer from reality or his characters refuse to act like rational humans. In “Bodyguard,” Mercurio’s breakneck story feels, at every moment, both carefully constructed and made up on the spot. It’s difficult to go into any further detail because the constant revelations and reversals make the show an all-spoilers affair. It can also be a blast, if you’re all about the mystery and the forward momentum and your requirements for plausibility and psychological realism aren’t high. Whether American viewers will be sucked in the way British viewers were is a question that won’t get a definitive answer, since Netflix releases no numbers. British shows that hit it big in America tend to be raucous comedies (“Absolutely Fabulous”), genteel soap operas (“Downton Abbey”) or historical re-enactments (“The Crown”), not thrillers. But maybe Mercurio’s puzzle box can buck the trend.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Borderline’ Is Rigged, to Fantastic Effect","Fred Astaire merely danced up the walls and across the ceiling. Sébastien Ramirez acts more like a superhero. Slowly pedaling his legs in the air, the French hip-hop choreographer could be an astronaut walking in outer space. A dancer of uncommon finesse and control, he requires no external assistance to convey the illusion of operating in lower gravity. But in Wang Ramirez’s “Borderline,” he has help: wires and rigging that allow him to shoot up suddenly or dive headfirst and stop to hover an inch from the ground. This extension of technique is the most striking aspect of the 70-minute work, which had its New York premiere on Friday at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater as part of the White Light Festival. Mr. Ramirez is joined by Honji Wang, his partner in direction and choreography, as well as by three other appealing dancers of exceptional skill and suppleness, and the expert rigger Alister Mazzotti. Separately and together, they deliver astonishment after astonishment. But the show doesn’t cohere. Structurally, it’s a string of sketches, each playing with a movement or costume idea. What if Ms. Wang and the other female dancer, Johanna Faye, did break dancing in four-inch heels? How would it change the shape of b-boy moves like spiraling on backs and shoulders if everyone wore stretchy skirts? The wires are the strongest thread, tied to an exploration of gravity that continues even in the sections without the rigging. In one duet, Mr. Ramirez and Saïdo Lehlouh grip wrists and cantilever their weight so that Mr. Ramirez can do his spacewalking, stepping on air. The wires also hint at an idea that isn’t only physical, allowing the dancers to fly, to follow the dreamed-about implications of their movement, but also tethering them, sometimes dragging them backward seemingly against their will. There are many such ideas in “Borderline,” pushed around and pulled aloft like the metal cubes of the set, which have something to do with the cages of identity. The electronic score by LACRYMOBOY includes spoken anecdotes, almost all in French. The printed program provides translations: One is a shaggy tale about abuse of power, another a rant about democracy as a lie. But neither understanding French nor reading the program helps much in connecting those stories to the one in English about “bad energies” or to the moodiness and aggression that keep popping up in the dance. It’s not just that Ms. Wang and Mr. Ramirez don’t handle their ideas with as much control as they handle their bodies. The thematic material and the movement invention often pull in opposite directions so that neither is fully realized. That’s frustrating, especially since the movement is so amazing. At the end of “Borderline,” Ms. Wang, attached to a wire, walks up the side of Mr. Ramirez. They embrace as lovers, but again and again, she soars skyward as if on gusts of wind. Like so much else in the show, she floats breathtakingly, right out of his grasp.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Camping’ Is a Long, Uncomfortable Trip","When we first see Kathryn (Jennifer Garner), she’s leaping into the air in slow-motion, against a backdrop of nature and blue sky. It’s a performance: She’s having her husband Walt (David Tennant) snap her picture for her Instagram account (which is “cresting 11,000 followers”). She rushes over to see the images, her happy face flickering off and her eyebrows pitching a tent of anxiety. “Did you like it?” she asks. “It’s kicky, right?” Kathryn and Walt are heading into the California wild for a weekend trip, with friends and family, to mark his 45th birthday. But the celebration is secondary to the show’s primary interest: Kathryn’s constant effort to present, both for her virtual followers and real-life compatriots, an air of joy that she achieves through military rigor. She takes severe pains to appear carefree. You could describe “Camping,” which begins Sunday on HBO, as a comedy of severe pain. Kathryn has had a hysterectomy — her Instagram account is aimed at “working moms and women living with chronic pain” — and the series makes a running joke of her continual complaints about her pelvic floor. There’s physical injury and emotional injury and the woe Kathryn inflicts on her less-than-rustic guests with her idea of strictly scheduled fun. (Friends don’t make friends bird-watch.) The comedy of social discomfort can be exquisite, like a deep-tissue massage that hurts until it feels good. “Camping” has moments like that. But too often it shoots past cringe comedy into straight-up cruelty without relief or enough redeeming laughs, becoming a “No Exit” experience of watching the terrible be terrible to the terrible. “Camping” comes from Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner of “Girls,” who adapted it from a British series along with John Riggi, and it shares their previous show’s penchant for skewering the myopic urban privileged. [Read about the production of “Camping”] Kathryn and Walt (a nebbishy sap, quietly suffering a yearslong sexual drought) are joined by her sunnily dim sister, Carleen (Ione Skye); Kathryn’s estranged best friend, Nina-Joy (Janicza Bravo); their partners (Chris Sullivan and Brett Gelman); and one uninvited, unenthusiastic teen, Sol (Cheyenne Haynes). Everyone in the group, unbeknown to Kathryn, regards her with something ranging from dislike to fear, while she nags, passive-aggressively judges and treats her son Orvis (Duncan Joiner) as if he were made of glass. She’s a helicopter parent, a helicopter wife and a helicopter friend. The dynamic is destabilized when the recently separated Miguel (Arturo del Puerto) shows up with his new girlfriend, a free-spirited DJ / reiki healer / artisanal nut-cheese maker named Jandice (Juliette Lewis, in a Juliette Lewis role). She’s the anti-Kathryn, impulsive, wild and irresponsible, and her presence pops open the group’s tensions like the lid on a novelty can of snakes. It’s hard at first to pinpoint where “Camping” goes wrong, because there’s a lot right with it. It has a solid comedic cast, from the crisply tight-wired Garner on down. (Bridget Everett wrings every drop from a small role as the rough-edged proprietor of the campsite.) Dunham and Konner, as on “Girls,” have perfect pitch for the language and mores of this stratum of society. (Who else would have an antiques dealer sell a vintage ring to a couple of bohemian fortysomethings by noting that it “was given to Liz Phair by John Cusack”?) And there’s something of-the-moment in Kathryn’s character, a woman driven half-nuts by the Goopian pressure to model perfect motherhood and hospitality. The core problem is how cartoonishly the show draws Kathryn. I found myself becoming sympathetic to her for no other reason than that “Camping” is so stacked against her; I don’t know if it’s possible for a show to bully its own protagonist, but it might look something like this. Not that the show is especially generous to her self-indulgent, solipsistic companions, either. (The only adult not made into a caricature is Nina-Joy, who’s given hardly any personality at all.) There is, on paper, the material to go deeper with Kathryn — to ask, without sacrificing the lacerating humor, what made her this way? “Girls” was expert at showing when its characters were full of it while also exploring just what filled them with it. But “Camping” doesn’t seem to have any such curiosity. That might yet work if it were simply funnier, if it built momentum from the cascading disaster of the ill-conceived trip. Instead it drags, hitting the same notes about Kathryn’s obliviousness and self-dramatizing, and it starts to feel like a long weekend indeed. The show is all the more frustrating for the amount of potential and talent involved. “Camping” could be a cutting social satire of the modern drive to try to make one’s life live up to the impossible perfection of staged moments on Instagram. But it’s hard to see past the harsh filter.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Charm City’ Vividly Captures the Streets of Baltimore,"There’s plenty to make you catch your breath during Marilyn Ness’s documentary “Charm City,” a sweeping look at violent crime and possible solutions in Baltimore. But the most staggering statistic comes in a notice at the end: The film is dedicated to the memory of the more than 1,000 people said to be killed in Baltimore during the film’s making. The movie opens in July 2015, three months after the death of Freddie Gray, an event that Ness keeps mainly on the periphery. Broadly speaking, “Charm City” operates on two tracks. One involves the city’s residents, like Clayton Guyton, or Mr. C., a former correctional officer who runs an East Baltimore community center and works to reduce violence on his block. The other track involves the city apparatus, including Monique Brown, a longtime police officer who says that when she joined the force, friends said they wouldn’t talk to her, and a young councilman, Brandon M. Scott. He makes the case that Baltimore has focused too narrowly on policing instead of addressing education, employment and health. It’s become de rigueur to compare Baltimore movies to “The Wire,” but it’s an unavoidable reference point here, not least for the scene in which an officer ventures inside a vacant house that’s become a drug den or because we see a bit of Dante Barksdale, an anti-violence outreach coordinator whose uncle was said to be an inspiration for characters in the HBO series. The film captures up close the way violence transforms neighborhoods and families with an immediacy that transcends headlines or sensationalism.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Deutschland 86,’ an East-West Thriller, Looks South","You may find the scheme at the center of “Deutschland 86” a bit confusing. That’s all right; so does Martin Rauch (Jonas Nay), the reluctant East German spy roped into carrying it out. As it’s explained to him, his government needs him to facilitate an illicit sale of West German weapons to South Africa, with the assistance of the African National Congress — even though the A.N.C. is bitterly opposed to the apartheid regime, and South Africa is allied with East Germany’s rivals in the Cold War. Martin is told the deal is for the greater good. But he still has questions. “East, West,” he says. “Who are the good guys?” In the pulpy-serious “Deutschland 86,” the definition is very flexible. The 10-episode series, beginning Thursday on SundanceTV, is the follow-up to 2015’s “Deutschland 83,” a German-American coproduction created by the wife-and-husband team Anna and Jörg Winger. That season introduced Martin as a naïve border guard, recruited by his aunt Lenora (Maria Schrader), a cynical, formidable intelligence operative, to infiltrate the West German military in 1983. The drama was like a peppermint schnapps chaser to the moody vodka shot of FX’s “The Americans.” It had a pop sensibility and stylish air, and it was as much a coming-of-age story as a Cold War thriller. [Read our coverage of “The Americans.”] Picking up three years later, “Deutschland 86” broadens its scope and shifts its axis, focusing on how the battle between capitalism and communism enfolded north and south as well as east and west. The series (subtitled in English) opens in Cape Town, where Lenora shares a stunning midcentury-modern apartment with Rose Seithathi (Florence Kasumba), an A.N.C. agent. (There’s a striking scene in which the two operatives stride down a hallway, equal in their deadly confidence, then separately enter the “Whites” and “Non-Whites” elevators.) They’re selling arms to the enemy because East Germany is dead broke, in debt to the West, cut loose by Mikhail Gorbachev’s Soviet Union. Its bureaucrats are left to try to salvage communism through fire-sale capitalism: selling off artworks, importing garbage from West Germany, allowing medical tests on its citizens. At least, they console themselves, they’re not starving like the Romanians — yet. Needing help, Lenora finds Martin at an orphanage in communist Angola, where he’s been exiled after disobeying orders, at the end of “Deutschland 83,” in order to stave off a nuclear war. He’s a more somber character now, hardened and healthily mistrustful, but he agrees, in exchange for being allowed to return home and see his young son. The new season is more action-oriented than the first, skipping across the continent of Africa and both sides of the Berlin Wall, abetted by some hefty exposition downloads and pop-cultural references. (Falco fans, you shall not be disappointed.) The story feels more strained in its efforts to keep numerous characters from the “83” season busy. In East Germany, Annett (Sonja Gerhardt), the mother of Martin’s son, has become a zealous functionary in the Stasi, where Walter (Sylvester Groth), Martin’s father, is pitching an arms-smuggling plan inspired by a German version of “The Love Boat.” Another thread, involving activists in West Germany and the growing AIDS crisis, feels detached. There’s a lot of history and genealogy to recall in these subplots, and the three years that have passed since “83” are like three centuries in peak-TV time. “Deutschland 86” largely stands on its own, but you may need a Google tab open while watching. The show’s strength remains Lenora and Martin, who are both partners and antagonists. He’s a patriot but a confused one, trying to keep his moral bearings while his country loses its own. To Lenora, Martin is a callow, self-indulgent boy, unwilling to sacrifice the few to help the many: “You can’t see past the end of your own nose.” Schrader, radiating ’80s Eurocool, gives swagger and charisma to what might otherwise be an empty villainess. For “Americans” fans in withdrawal, this isn’t a perfect replacement. It’s not a slow burn but a potboiler, and it sometimes lurches into “24”-esque absurdity and James Bond sudsiness. (When Martin is assigned to seduce a mark, there’s a cornball shot of him framed, “Graduate”-style, between her calves.) But it has a similar sense of espionage as an intimate entanglement and a theme of risking one’s life for a lost cause, because family is family and home is home. And the details are remarkable, like the Angolan war orphans — at risk of being conscripted as soldiers in an exploitative proxy war — sitting on the floor to play “Risiko,” a variant of the global conquest board game Risk. That’s “Deutschland 86” in miniature. It’s good fun, but it knows that its subject is more than a game.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘First Man’ Takes a Giant Leap for Man, a Smaller Step for Movies","In July of 1969, as the world’s attention was fixed on the spectacle of the first lunar landing, news broadcasts would sometimes flash back to a speech given by President John F. Kennedy earlier in the decade. In effect writing the check that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins would cash a half-dozen years after his death, Kennedy vowed to send astronauts to the moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard. A clip of that speech appears near the end of “First Man,” Damien Chazelle’s sweeping and intimate new film, which takes the conquest of difficulty as both theme and inspiration. Retelling the story of the American space program from the early ’60s to the Apollo 11 mission through the lens of Armstrong’s professional and personal life, Chazelle (drawing on James R. Hansen’s biography) unfurls a chronicle of setbacks, obstacles and tragedies on the way to eventual triumph. It can be hard, almost 50 years later, to appreciate how many times, and in how many ways, the moon landing almost didn’t happen. Not only that: We might think we’ve seen it all before. “First Man,” its ending spoiled in advance, tries to restore a sense of uncertainty, of contingency, of the vast unknown that Armstrong and his colleagues faced. It also tries to find a fresh set of images (in IMAX, no less) to convey the strangeness and sublimity of those moments at Tranquility Base just after the “giant leap,” so we might intuit at least a glimmer of the awe that Armstrong must have felt. All of this is a daunting challenge — nowhere near as perilous or costly as Apollo itself, of course, but in its way a mirror of that undertaking. Chazelle is an ambitious filmmaker who makes films about ambition. His recent features constitute a kind of trilogy on the subject, each one larger in scale and grander in scope than the one before. [Readers tell us what they remember about the moon landing] “Whiplash,” “La La Land” and now “First Man” all concern a young or youngish man’s hunger for greatness, and suggest a developmental sequence, for both the archetypal character and for the director. The fledgling drummer played by Miles Teller in “Whiplash” (2014), defined by his aggressive competitiveness and his struggle with a demanding mentor, gives way, two years later, to the pianist (Ryan Gosling) in “La La Land” who navigates his own career in the context of a romantic partnership and professional rivalry with an equally driven artist (Emma Stone). Armstrong, a husband and father embedded in an organization that rewards both individual initiative and regimental discipline, completes the sequence. “First Man,” with Gosling as Armstrong (and a script by Josh Singer, who wrote “Spotlight” and “The Post”), is also the portrait of a career, as well as — a bravura act of careerism. I don’t mean that dismissively. Chazelle, already the youngest winner of an Oscar for directing, has always set his sights on the Hollywood mainstream. Like “La La Land,” which set out to re-energize the apparently antiquated genre of the musical, “First Man” is at once knowingly old-fashioned and shrewdly up-to-date. Its nostalgia — for a suburban, middle-class social order of crew-cut dads, stay-at-home moms, station wagons and cigarettes, and also for idealistic, robustly funded federal-government programs — is palpable. And yet Chazelle’s interest in Armstrong is as much personal as historical: bureaucratic snags, political-turf battles and engineering puzzles provide the narrative machinery, but feelings are the film’s fuel. Armstrong’s progress from pilot to celestial pioneer traces an epic arc, and like some of the ancient epics “First Man” is primarily a character study, a space odyssey with a diffident and enigmatic Ulysses at its center. His Penelope — loyal, anxious, angry, exhausted — is Janet (Claire Foy, trading in her plummy royal diction for flattened Midwestern vowels). She moves to Houston with her husband and their two young sons after Neil is accepted into the Gemini program. (The NASA people in the movie pronounce it Gemin-ee, not Gemin-eye.) Earlier, when he was at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the couple’s young daughter, Karen, died of a brain tumor, and “First Man” posits Neil and Janet’s grief as a kind of Rosebud, a half-buried center of emotional and psychological gravity, a source of motive and meaning. Karen’s is not the only death to be mourned. Janet sometimes seems to move through her days in anticipation of widowhood, and the progress of the Gemini and Apollo programs is measured partly in lives lost. Even for viewers versed in NASA history, who will know the fates of certain characters as soon as they are introduced, the deaths come as a shock. They are dramatized with cinematic tact, so that what you register is not horror but a sudden, disorienting absence, as if the men had vanished into space rather than crashing to earth or burning up on the launchpad. Neil, for all his competitive drive, is very much a team player, and the moon shot is a collective effort. “First Man” is more sports movie than science fiction, and not only because one of the mission commanders (Deke Slayton) is played by Kyle Chandler, forever Coach Taylor to “Friday Night Lights” fans. Slayton and Robert Gilruth (Ciaran Hinds) oversee a squad of rivals and comrades, showboats and role players, all of them contending with an invisible, formidable opposing team. The Russians! The Soviet Union had beaten the United States to every space-travel milestone, and NASA’s lunar program is like a fourth-quarter drive to score the winning touchdown. The natural quarterback seems to be Ed White (Jason Clarke), Neil’s closest friend. The wild card is Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll), who shoots off his mouth and is more tolerated than beloved by his teammates. There are a scattering of wide-eyed rookies and wise veterans to round out the squad. (Shea Whigham, Christopher Abbott and Patrick Fugit stand out in a fine supporting cast.) The guys all work hard, drink beer together after hours and dwell in a Valhalla of tough-and-tender male camaraderie. Neil is a bit of an odd man out. The greatest challenge “First Man” confronts isn’t recreating spaceflight and the attendant technology — though the rattling din of ascent and the eerie quiet of zero-gravity are impressively rendered — but illuminating the inner life of a man who often behaved as if he were in possession of no such thing. It can be hard to tell if Neil possesses an extra-dry wit or if he’s just literal-minded. (When the astronauts are asked at a news conference what they’d like to bring to the moon with them, his answer is “more fuel.”) No one can guess how deep his still waters run — not his colleagues, not Janet, not their boys. His buttoned-up temperament, though, makes him a perfect representative of the paradox of space travel, a wildly poetic venture undertaken by men whose survival depended on the prose of memos and the music of calculus. Other movies about the American space program have featured cowboys, matinee idols and Boy Scouts — Sam Shepard’s Chuck Yeager and Ed Harris’s John Glenn in “The Right Stuff,” Tom Hanks’s Jim Lovell in “Apollo 13” — but this Neil Armstrong is a different archetype. He’s an egghead, and maybe also a bit of a cold fish. Gosling, underplaying with every fiber of his being, commits fully to the heroism of this conception of the character, but Chazelle doesn’t entirely trust it. Or rather, he lacks confidence that the audience will warm to such a man, and so he pipes in a layer of sentimentality that is effective without being fully convincing. From time to time, grumbling is heard about the point of it all — the actual Apollo program, that is, which gobbled up public money at a time of social unrest and military conflict. Chazelle inserts a performance of Gil Scott-Heron’s “Whitey on the Moon,” a bitterly satirical protest song that could have provided an alternative title for the movie. Such dissent is washed away by the sheer sublimity of the astronaut’s achievement as it is shared, via television, by tens of millions of people around the world. For a time, at least, people stopped asking about the point of it all. It was self-evident. “First Man” falls short of that kind of grandeur, though not for lack of trying. It gets almost everything right, but it’s also strangely underwhelming. It reminds you of an extraordinary feat and acquaints you with an interesting, enigmatic man. But there is a further leap beyond technical accomplishment — into meaning, history, metaphysics or the wilder zones of the imagination — that the film is too careful, too earthbound, to attempt.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Foreign Land’ Sees a Better Past Than Future for the Middle East,"“I’m angry at myself for having children,” Ghassan Abbas, an Israeli-born Arab, says near the end of “Foreign Land.” “Where did I bring them to? What kind of world?” Earlier, we heard how this man had once embraced life in the Middle East despite the problems there. To see him succumb to despair is affecting and is the most expressive moment in this otherwise subdued documentary. Abbas is an actor and a friend of Shlomi Eldar, an Israeli journalist who directed the film. Eldar moved to the United States years ago, and in monologues and conversations with Abbas, the two bemoan the rise of extremist ideology on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They also reflect on anger, identity and belonging. “After years in America, I feel confused and disconnected: one foot here, one foot there, a foreigner in both lands,” Eldar says, echoing similar feelings by Abbas about his own circumstances. Their opinions are perceptive. Yet even with its short running time, the film can wander, with nature shots and other footage that seems attached only to add lyricism. In place of some kind of discovery there is mostly lamentation. That may be a valid response to events in Israel, but it’s not always a good way to engage a viewer. By the end, these two men and others agree that there was hope in the past. Now, however, the future appears bleak for Israelis and Palestinians. “The situation is deteriorating rapidly,” Abbas’s son says. “I’m not afraid of what’s happened so far. I’m afraid of what’s going to happen.”",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Girl From the North Country’ Sets the Darkness Aglow,"Brightness flickers fitfully in the bleak, beautiful landscape of “Girl From the North Country,” a rich and strange marriage of the talents of the Irish playwright Conor McPherson and the American songwriter Bob Dylan. The setting for this haunting musical melodrama of unmoored lives is, after all, a premature winter. In Minnesota. During the Great Depression. So when something like joy or hope or love promises to light up the night in this ravishing production, which opened on Monday night at the Public Theater, it doesn’t stand much chance against the prevailing darkness. This is a story of an age of privation and separation, in which homes are lost and families riven. Yet when the people onstage sing, huddled together before old-time microphones as if they were campfires, they seem to conjure light and warmth out of the cold, cold night that surrounds them. These fleeting moments register with the glow of retinal afterimages, as though they were happening behind closed eyes. As for the sweet, sorrowful voices, backed by fiddles and piano, they seem to come, beseechingly, from half-remembered family histories you might have been told by your grandparents. If you’re a hard-core Dylan fan, you’ve heard these songs before. But, for me at least, they’ve never sounded quite so heartbreakingly personal and universal at the same time. As arranged and orchestrated by the British composer Simon Hale — in collaboration with Mr. McPherson, the show’s director as well as its writer — the songs exist in self-sufficient independence of their creator’s gravelly, much imitated voice. You hear them ripening into new fullness. Those who scoffed when Mr. Dylan received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016 may find they have to think again. “Girl From the North Country” debuted at London’s Old Vic Theater in the summer of 2017, eight months after the prize had been announced. Five years earlier, Mr. McPherson was approached by representatives of Mr. Dylan about using the songwriter’s catalog as the basis for a musical. It seemed like a bizarre conjunction, that of a Gaelic dramatist and an American balladeer. But in plays like “Shining City” and “The Night Alive,” Mr. McPherson has shown a mystical appreciation of music as an expression of the numinous in life. That respect for the ineffable has been translated into the most imaginative and inspired use to date of a popular composer’s songbook in this blighted era of the jukebox musical. In unfolding his portrait of the desperate tenants of a boardinghouse in Duluth, Minn. (Mr. Dylan’s birthplace), in late 1934, Mr. McPherson never uses songs as a substitute for or extension of dialogue, à la “Mamma Mia!” Only occasionally does a number — like the 1966 classic “I Want You” — seem to echo directly the thoughts of the characters singing it. Instead, nearly every ensemble member becomes part of a choir, with soloists, that is as persuasive a latter-day equivalent of the Greek chorus as we’re ever likely to see. What’s created, through songs written by Mr. Dylan over half a century, is a climate of feeling, as pervasive and evasive as fog. It’s an atmosphere of despair — with lyrics about lost chances, lost love and enduring loneliness — that finds grace in the communion of voices. coming together. Certainly, the script is as forbiddingly fatalistic as that of a Greek tragedy. At its center is Nick Laine (Stephen Bogardus), who rents out rooms in his ramshackle house in the hope of forestalling foreclosure. His family includes an alcoholic young son, Gene (Colton Ryan), who hopes to be a writer, and an adopted daughter, Marianne (Kimber Sprawl), who is pregnant, though how or by whom no one seems to know. Nick’s wife, Elizabeth (Mare Winningham), is there and not there, suffering from a dementia that has turned her into a dependent, unruly child with a sailor’s mouth. So Nick seeks comfort in the arms of a boarder, Mrs. Neilsen (Jeannette Bayardelle), who expects to come into some money. Most everybody here has such expectations; nobody really believes in them. Images of lost and murdered children haunt the narrative, specters of snuffed lives and broken hopes. Also living on the premises are the Burkes — the blustery, big-talking father (Marc Kudisch) and the louche mother (Luba Mason) of Elias (Todd Almond), a grown man with a toddler’s mind. The newest arrivals are a self-described man of God, Reverend Marlowe (David Pittu), and an ex-convict and boxer, Joe Scott (Sydney James Harcourt). The visitors include Mr. Perry (Tom Nelis), a septuagenarian widower who is courting Marianne; Gene’s sometime girl, Kate Draper (Caitlin Houlahan); and the family physician, Dr. Walker (Robert Joy). The doc is a cracker-barrel philosopher and occasional omniscient narrator in the folksy tradition of the Stage Manager of Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town.” He is also addicted to morphine. These elements might have come from a build-your-own-vintage-American-social-realist drama assembly kit. I regard the 47-year-old Mr. McPherson as perhaps the finest English-language playwright of his generation. But last year, when I saw “Girl” on its opening night in London, with a British ensemble straining for Americanness, the script often felt labored and imitative. With a uniformly excellent American cast that wears its roles like confining and prickly skins, and on a smaller stage, “Girl” feels far more convincingly of a piece. The work of the same team of designers — Rae Smith (set and costumes), Mark Henderson (lighting) and Simon Baker (sound) — comes together here with the self-containment of a poem. Within the production’s alternating visions of the claustrophobic boardinghouse and desolate roadscapes, the fraught denizens of Duluth seem perched precariously on the brink of infinity. There’s a mythic quality to the silhouetted figures who step from the shadows to sing and play instruments. (Lucy Hind’s movement direction is superb.) And how they sing, every one of them. Moments I seem destined to recall forever include Ms. Winningham delivering “Like a Rolling Stone” as a curse and “Forever Young” as an elegy; Mr. Harcourt leading “Hurricane” like a rampant force of nature; and Ms. Mason (who doubles as a drummer) singing “Is Your Love in Vain?” with the wounded cynicism of a seen-it-all barroom chanteuse. Oh, and I haven’t mentioned how Ms. Sprawl turns “Idiot Wind” into a philosophic half-acceptance of romantic attraction. Or the miraculous moment when Mr. Almond’s stunted Elias croons “Duquesne Whistle” in the style of a big-band heartthrob. The show’s most heartbreaking moments, though, are perhaps its happiest. I’m thinking in particular of the jubilant performance of “You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere” that begins the second act. It’s performed as a sort of hoedown celebration, with dancing that defines each participant as an idiosyncratic individual and as part of a synchronized whole. You may find yourself thinking that this is as close as mortals come to heaven on Earth. And for just a few, infinitely precious moments, a radiance eclipses the all-devouring night.

2019,"Review: ‘Gloria: A Life,’ Starring Ms. Steinem and Her Audience","Something powerful is happening at the Daryl Roth Theater in Union Square — but it isn’t so much the play that opened there on Thursday night as the audience. That play, by Emily Mann, is “Gloria: A Life,” a paint-by-numbers portrait of Gloria Steinem. It would make a useful introduction to the feminist trailblazer for those who know little about her remarkable overlapping careers as a journalist, activist and “wandering organizer” for the revolution. For those who already know the story, perhaps from Ms. Steinem’s memoir “My Life on the Road,” the play itself — as opposed to the experience of it — does not have much new to add. Even if it wanted to, it couldn’t; Ms. Steinem’s professional life (the personal details are mostly omitted here) has been way too busy and fruitful to cover any part of it in depth. Instead we get something of a historical pageant or three-dimensional animatronic exhibit. Certainly Christine Lahti, in the title role, looks like a museum replica of Ms. Steinem, from tinted aviator glasses to black bell-bottoms. (The costumes are by Jessica Jahn; the wigs by Anne Ford-Coates.) Ms. Lahti also gets the emotional style right — a style I would call assertive warmth with a hefty chaser of self-deprecation. That self-deprecation helps leaven the hagiography here, but it’s hard not to be impressed all over again by Ms. Steinem’s achievements, and what she achieved them in spite of. Among the greatest hits rehearsed are her early reporting on the women’s movement, her involvement in the creation of Ms. magazine and her championing of intersectional feminism before it even had that name. Hits in the other sense are not ignored either, and these, no matter how familiar, still manage to shock. I cringed again at the story of a New York Times editor who suggests to Ms. Steinem that they discuss her work “in a hotel room this afternoon.” Evergreen in its awfulness, too, is the 1963 cab ride in which Gay Talese explains to Saul Bellow, as Ms. Steinem sits between them, “You know how every year there’s a pretty girl who comes to New York and pretends to be a writer? Well … Gloria is this year’s pretty girl.” Six actors play the non-Gloria characters in most of these scenes, shifting swiftly from male to female, young to old, bemused to bereaved. Among those whose embodiment feels most powerful are Florynce Kennedy (Patrena Murray) and Wilma Mankiller (DeLanna Studi) — black and Native American feminist leaders too often absent from standard histories. For reasons that are surprisingly similar, Ms. Steinem’s mother also looms large. Ruth Steinem (Joanna Glushak) started out as a journalist herself, writing under a man’s name — but gave it up to be a mother. Her ambition and self-erasure seem to provide both a positive and negative model for her daughter. But even these powerful stories, let alone the hundreds of others, get short shrift in Diane Paulus’s staging, as the actors quickly dissolve back into the ensemble and the anecdote parade passes on without follow-up. (We never learn anything more about Ms., for instance, after its preview issue in 1971.) This gives “Gloria: A Life” the wedged-in, medley feel of a jukebox musical. Or maybe it would be more apt to compare it to a consciousness-raising group, the kind in which Ms. Steinem found her own voice by listening to others. “Social justice movements start with people sitting in a circle,” she says in the play, and sure enough, the amphitheater layout of the Daryl Roth space is, in Amy Rubin’s intimate design, as close to a circle as possible. The stage area in the middle, carpeted with Persian rugs like Ms. Steinem’s own apartment, is the kind of place where you’d like to curl up to share stories and, in sharing them, amplify them. That, astonishingly, is exactly what happens in the second part of the evening: a 20-minute talking circle in which audience members are invited (but in no way coerced) to share their responses to what they’ve seen. Not everyone who chose to speak on Tuesday night observed the Black Lives Matter principles enunciated at the start of the circle: “Lead with love, low ego, high impact, move at the speed of trust.” But what happened next took the raw materials of the play and turned them into thrilling community drama. Many of the women who spoke — no men did — had Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation on their minds as they looked for ways to deal with their rage. At each performance, the talking circle is kicked off by a special guest, and on Tuesday the guest responded to the despair in the room by describing herself as a “hope-aholic.” She too was angry, she said, but buoyed by the incalculably greater number of women fighting for their rights today than when she started. “I have hope because it used to be so much worse,” she explained, and in that moment the hope seemed contagious. Of course, this was Ms. Steinem herself; she had emerged at the end of the play proper in much the same outfit Ms. Lahti was wearing. “I’m not sure I can follow myself,” she said slyly. More’s the pity. This information was last updated on March 31, 2019",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween’ Is Toothless Terror,"In this goofy sequel to the movie adaptation of R. L. Stine’s beloved children’s horror series, “Goosebumps,” Sam (Caleel Harris) and Sonny (Jeremy Ray Taylor) are adolescent friends with a fledgling junk-disposal business. On their first day on the job, they find an unpublished Stine manuscript and a menacing ventriloquist’s doll named Slappy inside an abandoned house, and claim these treasures for themselves. Slappy (voiced by Mick Wingert) swiftly comes to life, wreaking havoc on Sonny’s family, school and eventually the entire town of Wardenclyffe, where Sam and Sonny live. When Slappy reveals an ability to grant life to other inanimate objects, Wardenclyffe’s electrical towers and department store costume sections become the source of supernatural spectacle. But despite the characters’ screams, their scares are rarely filmed in a way that might give the audience pleasure. In spite of its spooky source material, the movie is more of a family fantasy than a thriller. If children once stole the original “Goosebumps” books from libraries to hide the source of their nightmares from their parents, “Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween” feels slightly supervisory — a movie to leave playing in the background of a child’s birthday party. The movie is not all medicine with no sugar. Most of the set-piece sequences use extensive computer-generated imagery, but the director, Ari Sandel, also makes room for practical effects and real-life set dressing in his depiction of possessed Wardenclyffe. Giant spiders made from balloons dwarf whole homes, headless horsemen haunt lawns. The production design displays a genuine enthusiasm for the decorative kitsch of the Halloween season, and the flashes of giddy craftiness beneath the slick style almost compensate for the toothlessness of the horror. An earlier version of this review misidentified the voice actor for the ventriloquist’s doll named Slappy. It is Mick Wingert, not Jack Black. video",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Homecoming’ Is Military, Industrial and Complex","Sam Esmail’s “Mr. Robot” is one of the most audacious, inventive TV dramas of this decade. It is also, well, a lot. It’s narratively and creatively maximalist, full of subplots, conspiracies, directorial triple back flips and twist upon baffling twist. Esmail directs all 10 episodes of “Homecoming,” a cerebral thriller that arrives on Amazon Friday, but he didn’t write it; it’s the creation of Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg. Visually and thematically, it plays like a lean, focused distillation of Esmail’s other series. It has the cool tone, the paranoia, the visual flourishes, the mind-bending revelations. But these effects are concentrated on a single, intricate story, laid out in 10 swift and magnetic episodes. In this case, less is very much more. The plot, of which it is best to say little, involves the corporatization of government, a favorite subject of “Mr. Robot.” Heidi Bergman (Julia Roberts) has just started work as a counselor at the Homecoming center, a privately run facility for the reintegration of combat veterans, where she sees clients like Walter Cruz (Stephan James), a wry, good-natured veteran struggling with survivor’s guilt. The Homecoming facility, set in a drab office park somewhere in Florida, is just there to help soldiers get on with life. You’ll quickly supply the “ … or is it?” yourself. In between sessions, Heidi fields hectoring calls from her boss, Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an executive for the Geist Group, the company running Homecoming. He is more interested in extracting “data” from the vets, for some unknown purpose, than helping them. Esmail’s signature style leaps at you immediately: the god’s-eye overhead shots, the image composition that puts you productively off-balance, the screen titles bigger than your living room. But the abundance of style serves the substance, creating an atmosphere of room-tone menace. Everything about the Homecoming center is bland and minimalist — “hip but masculine,” Colin calls the décor — and “Homecoming” understands that anonymous spaces, euphemism and depersonalized corporate-speak can be more terrifying than any jump scare. The most striking visual choice is the screen itself. The Homecoming scenes, set in 2018, are presented in typical wide-screen format. A second story line, four years in the future, is set off by black bars that squeeze the frame claustrophobically. In this future, Heidi is living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and waiting tables at a dump of a restaurant. A customer, Thomas Carrasco (Shea Whigham) identifies himself as an auditor from the Department of Defense, investigating a complaint about Homecoming. Sorry, Heidi tells him; she has no memory of ever working there. In an age of streaming-TV bloat, “Homecoming” is five efficient hours, about 30 minutes per episode. It manages to be deliberative and propulsive at the same time. It builds momentum even as the first few episodes may seem to meander, and it comes together in a suspenseful thriller with an emotional punch. The series is adapted from a podcast by Horowitz and Bloomberg, which presented its story in a telegraphic, found-audio format: phone conversations, taped counseling sessions, voice messages. This version finds a TV correlative for that approach, constructing itself largely as a series of conversations. [Read about how a podcast was transformed into a TV show.] Its heart is the sessions between Cruz and Heidi, who develop a warm, work-spouse relationship. Roberts harks back here to her crusader-whistleblower roles (“Erin Brockovich,” “The Pelican Brief”), but with a reserved, layered performance. Heidi needs to work and wants to do good, and she realizes, with slowly dawning horror, that those aims are in conflict. Cannavale breathes pushy life into Colin, who’s introduced as a stressed-out voice in split-screen phone conversations. Even when he interacts with other principals in the flesh, he’s basically a human Bluetooth headset, a mouthy, Mametian bulldozer spewing coach-speak: “Heidi, you are killing it! Fist bump!” James and Whigham are also impressive in more understated roles. James brings an easy charisma to a character who’s designed to be a puzzle. And Whigham (the blustery Eli in “Boardwalk Empire”), as an introvert more at home digging through file folders than confronting suspects, makes a terrific hero-nerd. It takes a bureaucrat, after all, to uncover a crime of bureaucracy, if that’s what’s afoot here. Like the tech-focused “Mr. Robot,” “Homecoming” is about the relation of individuals to corrupted systems. It may only take one villain to conceive an ill deed, but when it’s legitimized through the machinery of government and business, it becomes the work of many hands, like Heidi’s. Often those people do what the soldiers treated at Homecoming do: They repress; they deflect; they crate up their feelings in a box. They tell themselves what Heidi’s mother tells her: “People make compromises. You did what you had to do. You took a job.” Part of what “Homecoming” asks is: How responsible do you have to be for a thing before you’re morally responsible for it? How high up in an organization? In “Homecoming,” business is war by other means. And beyond its slickness and deft puzzle-story twists, this series is a perceptive study of the collateral damage.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Hunter Killer’ Explores the Depths of Geopolitics,"In “Hunter Killer,” ordinary alliances are suddenly upended and the United States Navy must do whatever it can to protect the interests of the Russian president. No, it’s not a documentary; it’s a submarine movie. Sent to find an American sub that appears to have sunk in Russian waters, Joe Glass (Gerard Butler), the captain of another American sub, quickly realizes that this was no ordinary sinking. A Russian vessel that plummeted alongside the missing American one was sabotaged, not torpedoed. Above ground, the Russian defense minister (Michael Gor) is staging a coup. He’s taken the Russian president (Alexander Diachenko) into custody and is intent on goading the United States into war. So far, most of the principals are falling for it, but not Joe, who doesn’t follow those rules they teach at Annapolis and has been at sea his entire career. (He rattles off the number of elections and Super Bowls he’s missed.) Following a Hail Mary plan concocted back in the states (Linda Cardellini and Common are on his side, which means they get yelled at a lot by Gary Oldman), he sets out to rescue the Russian head of state. The maneuvers through mines and sound sensors seem closer to a game of Battleship than “The Hunt for Red October,” but the director, Donovan Marsh, pulls off some solid suspense as the men make their moves and Joe, appealing to their common calling, wins the trust of the rescued captain of the Russian sub (Michael Nyqvist, who died last year). However nutty its geopolitics, “Hunter Killer” does its job as popcorn thriller with brisk efficiency.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Impulso’ Goes Backstage With a Flamenco Innovator,"The word “impulso,” the flamenco dancer Rocío Molina explains, refers to an urge that passes through the body before reaching the senses. The documentary “Impulso,” directed by Emilio Belmonte, follows Molina, who has been credited as one of flamenco’s rising stars for combining traditions with improvisations and other experiments, as she prepares for a show in Paris. The movie’s challenge is to bottle her spontaneity, which is clearly thrilling to behold in person but less dynamic in a medium that requires every move to be selected in advance, without the suspenseful bond that an artist shares with a live audience. Belmonte gets caught between two modes of nonfiction filmmaking. Part of “Impulso” is a demystification of the artistic process, in which Molina and her collaborators resort to generalities to explain their essentially intuitive choices. The other part is a performance film. At the beginning, Molina describes a flamenco dancer as an instrument, and the sound is the movie’s best aspect. But while the percussive rhythms guarantee that moviegoers will tap their toes, only a few moments, such as when Molina crawls over rocks at the Centre Pompidou Málaga, yield eye-catching images. The Paris performance, Caída del Cielo, presented in excerpts without much preparation on what to look for, feels like an anticlimax. The most vital moment in “Impulso” comes earlier, when Molina makes a joint appearance with the flamenco luminary Antonia Santiago Amador, known as La Chana, whose whole body seems to convulse with a passion “Impulso” otherwise rarely conveys.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Ipsa Dixit’ Makes an Unlikely Opera Out of Aristotle,"“Ipsa dixit,” the Latin phrase that gives Kate Soper’s playful, thoughtful, befuddling, enchanting work of music theater its title, means “she, herself, said it.” But it connotes something a bit more peremptory, closer to “because I said it, that’s just how it is.” Not the most appealing expression, perhaps, but Ms. Soper embraces it in this ambitious, ingenious piece, a 2017 Pulitzer Prize finalist that was performed on Saturday at the Miller Theater at Columbia University to open this season’s Composer Portraits series. It begins with her reciting a big, big question: “What is art?” Over the next 90 minutes, she answers, in essence, “Ipsa dixit”: It is whatever I say it is. [Read more about Ms. Soper in a conversation from earlier this year.] And what she says it is in “Ipsa Dixit” is brilliantly unlikely. The piece is a kind of lecture or philosophical inquiry in music, a rangy yet elegant rumination on the power of language, artistic control, mortality, influence, integrity and Aristotle, whose words make up large swaths of its text, along with Lydia Davis, Freud, Plato, Jenny Holzer and others. It may surprise you to learn that this heady mixture isn’t in the least pretentious or ponderous, but rather sweet, searching and deeply intelligent. From 2010-16, Ms. Soper wrote “Ipsa Dixit” — just released on a lucid recording from New World Records — for herself and a trio of instrumentalists (the flutist Erin Lesser, the percussionist Ian Antonio and the violinist Josh Modney) from Wet Ink Ensemble, of which she was a founder. In a sequence of six quartets and duets, this intimate group moves around the stage in stylized choreography, performing with the serious fun — and occasional melancholy and cruelty — of a commedia dell’arte troupe. The first section, “Poetics,” will not sound delightful if I describe it as quoting Aristotle to discuss the nature of art while Ms. Soper and the musicians imitate, ignore, play across and rebel against one another. But it is. The second, “Only the Words Themselves Mean What They Say,” to texts by Ms. Davis, looks at truth and loss in personal relationships; the third, “Rhetoric,” deals with the question of persuasion. (If rhetoric’s aim is to give truth a voice, how best should that voice — or Ms. Soper’s — behave?) “The Crito,” a duet set to one of Plato’s dialogues, dwells on the tension between laws and personal agency. Ms. Soper’s scope broadening into the galactic, “Metaphysics” takes on change and permanence, with the work reaching a serene climax at the promise of a “state of supreme contemplation.” A madcap amalgam of Freudian dreams and the pronunciation of vowels, “Cipher” mulls a line from a 1993 interview with Ms. Holzer: “I came to language because I wanted to be explicit about things.” Throughout this brainily winsome work, instruments are exchanged and deconstructed; speech alchemically transmutes into airy, calligraphic vocal lines and back again. While “Ipsa Dixit” is precisely crafted, it wittily and poignantly evokes the process of creation: flickering with ideas; moving in halting steps forward and back; seeming improvisatory, jotted, sketched. This is modest modernism. Fragments of scales and sudden swoops up to glassy high notes feel like scenes from a practice room. “Whatever I’m trying to say is not actually in the text or in the music,” Ms. Soper, who’s currently at work on an operatic adaptation of the medieval French epic “Le Roman de la Rose,” says in an interview in the Miller’s program. “It’s in the whole of what I’m doing.” What she’s doing is enacting the polarities out of which art emerges. She is both a composer and a performer, in control and in submission, a diva who stands apart and a colleague among other musicians. (Instrumentalists, in relation to a singer, are usually classified as mere “accompanists”; here they’re full, if fraught, partners.) Ashley Tata’s staging, having traveled and settled in since its premiere nearly two years ago, is fully confident and clear — clear, at least, in its portrayal of confusion and ambiguity. The interactions of the artists are a little vaudeville, a little Dada, a little erotic — sometimes synchronized, sometimes off-kilter. Bradley Peterson’s projections, which dominate the simple set, use images of nature to amplify the piece’s sly grandeur. Ms. Soper graciously shares the spotlight, though she remains always at the center of things, her presence warm if wary, charismatic but contained. As she wanders along the trail of her thoughts and readings, as you witness her forming the thing you are seeing, you root for her. And when she says it, whatever it is, you believe it.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Life and Nothing More’ Places Family in the Center,"“Life and Nothing More” begins on a bus ride to court and ends at a prison, but not for the reasons viewers — or, more to the point, the legal system — might intuit. The film touches on a lot of hot-button matters, including the 2016 election; racial profiling; and the difficulties of being a single parent and of earning a living wage. But it keeps the issues largely in the background. The goal, as the title suggests, is simply to present lives as they’re lived from moment to moment. Long stretches of the movie, from the Spanish-born writer-director Antonio Méndez Esparza, making his second feature, could easily be mistaken for a documentary, an impression that Méndez Esparza deepens though his visual style. Whether the setting is a classroom, a parking lot or a restaurant, he often keeps his camera at a slight distance from his (mostly nonprofessional) actors, maintaining a vantage point that we’ve come to associate with fly-on-the-wall filmmaking. But this is a drama — specifically, a mother-son story. The film opens with the teenage Andrew (Andrew Bleechington) and his mother, Regina (Regina Williams), on their way to court. Andrew, who is on probation after breaking into cars, has been skipping mandated counseling appointments, and it’s not the first time he’s upset Regina. She’s raising him, along with his much younger sister, on her own in Northern Florida, where she works as a waitress. (The film’s sense of place is especially strong.) Andrew’s father is in prison and plays a minimal role in his life. (“Sure,” Andrew says disinterestedly when a counselor asks if he would like to talk to his father more often; it’s tough for anyone to get Andrew to break his defensive silence.) Regina cautiously begins a romance with Robert (Robert Williams), who might fill that absence, though he’s hardly perfect, and Andrew rebels at the prospect. Describing the trajectory of “Life and Nothing More” makes it sound like a civics lesson, and in some scenes — we see Andrew learning about the Constitution and lawmaking in school — Méndez Esparza even cultivates that impression, overplaying his hand. But the bulk of the movie is more like the reverse: a slow accumulation of closely observed moments — Regina and Robert’s flirting during a pool game; Regina working while election returns play on a TV behind her; Andrew attending an anger management session — that add up to something much more nuanced, a portrait of lives that can’t be reduced to statistics.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Making a Murderer Part 2’: What’s Next for Steven Avery,"While watching Netflix’s “Making a Murderer Part 2,” you’re always aware that it exists in the world created by Part 1, the 10-episode series that helped ignite the true-crime-television explosion in 2015. The adage that the documentarian’s camera affects the events it records has never been more self-evidently true. Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi, who wrote and directed both seasons (Part 2 lands Friday), open the new installment with a news clip montage demonstrating the impact of the original. As they continue the stories of Steven Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey, both serving life sentences in Wisconsin for a 2005 murder, TV news crews are ever-present, drawn by the notoriety the series has given the men’s cases. When a lawyer says that the men’s hopes are dampened by the “highly politicized” situation, it’s understood that the fallout from the series has contributed to the politicizing. The attention drawn by “Making a Murderer” even creates its own spoiler problem: Anyone who has followed Mr. Avery’s and Mr. Dassey’s cases since the first season is likely to know the outcomes of the hearings and appeals that are supposed to provide much of the suspense this time around. Part 2 still offers its share of the mystery and surprise that made the original so compelling. It’s a very different viewing experience, however. “Making a Murderer” was a ready-made, a stranger-than-fiction saga that provided foolproof drama while benefiting greatly from Ms. Demos and Ms. Ricciardi’s meticulous and exhaustive approach. (After serving 18 years in prison for sexual assault and being exonerated by DNA evidence, Mr. Avery was arrested and convicted in the murder of Teresa Halbach and imprisoned again, this time for life; his then-teenage nephew was also convicted in Ms. Halbach’s murder.) Part 2 takes place with both men offscreen, their presence limited to prison telephone calls, and the trials and police investigations that filled much of the first season are seen only in flashback snippets. Its movement is incremental and quotidian, reflecting the torturous process of filing appeals and re-examining forensic evidence. That’s another way of saying that it’s slow, especially through the first four or five of its 10 episodes (which stretch across 10½ hours). It’s also more self-consciously constructed. It has an A plot, in which Mr. Avery’s new lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, a specialist in post-conviction exonerations, conducts an exhaustive re-examination of his case. And it has a B plot, in which Mr. Dassey’s lawyers try to prove that he was convicted because of a coerced confession. Bridging the two are scenes with the men’s intertwined families that can be repetitive but at their best are powerfully emotional. Ms. Zellner, tough and smart in equal measure, is Part 2’s star. At first the long discussions of ballistics and blood stains she conducts with her cadre of experts can be eye-glazing, but by the fifth episode the investigation kicks into gear. Over the second half of the season, Ms. Zellner develops a set of plausible alternative theories and suspects that provide the kind of sensational twists — in theory at least — that drew people into the original. The season’s identification with the supremely confident Ms. Zellner’s point of view is so complete that you may not notice right away how much time she spends sliming people — prosecutors, cops, potential suspects, other lawyers. More problematic, if you care to think about it, is the way in which the show’s focus on detection and questions of criminal justice takes the focus almost entirely away from Ms. Halbach, the victim. Ms. Demos and Ms. Ricciardi are not great stylists, and “Making a Murderer” often dulls out tonally and visually, locked into an unvarying mood of melancholic Americana — somber guitar music, lights going out in lonely houses at dusk. Someone else might make a spikier, darker show out of this material. But their method gathers force and pays off over time. They’re especially attuned to Mr. Avery’s steadfastly loyal parents, Dolores and Allan, whose declining health and spirits are the emotional core of Part 2 — a wasting away in tragic rhythm with their imprisoned son. It’s a semi-spoiler, for the viewer not aware of Mr. Avery’s and Mr. Dassey’s current fates, to note that even Ms. Zellner has to work to put on a brave face by the end of Part 2. Sadly, both men are young enough that there could easily be a Part 3.",The New York Times
