2019,"When It Comes to Weddings, Each Jonas Brother Has a Style","Joe Jonas’s recent nuptials to Sophie Turner, a star of ‘Game of Thrones,’ was a surprise ceremony in Vegas. It was very different from Nick’s elaborate celebrations and Kevin’s more traditional one. A decade ago, when the Jonas Brothers started pumping out the catchy tunes that launched them into the pop music stratosphere, each famously wore a purity ring. Now all three have traded their purity rings for wedding bands. But while the purity bands were matching, the weddings that led to the wedding rings — including the edible Ring Pop that Joe Jonas reportedly accepted last week at his marriage to the actress Sophie Turner — have been vastly different. Joe, 29, the swaggering star Jonas, married Ms. Turner, a “Game of Thrones” star, May 1 in a 15-minute ceremony at the Chapel L’Amour, a room in A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. Jesse Garon, the pompadour-wearing Elvis impersonator, officiated. (In a coincidence, Elvis Presley and Priscilla Beaulieu were also married on May 1, 1967, also in Vegas.) Mr. Garon, who performed more than 600 Vegas weddings last year and was previously unfamiliar with the Jonases, said the wedding differed from what he’s accustomed to mostly in size. “They had a really huge group of 40 people,” he said. “Most people have five or 10.” Also memorable was the end of the ceremony. “They knew how to have fun,” Mr. Garon said. “When we started singing ‘Viva Las Vegas,’ they got into it. Those brothers could sing O.K.” Diplo, the D.J. and music producer who had attended the Billboard Music Awards earlier that evening with the couple, captured the ceremony for followers and fans on Instagram Live. Ms. Turner, 23, wore a white low-necked jumpsuit with a traditional bridal veil. Joe and his brothers, Kevin, 31, and Nick, 26, who served as groomsmen, wore matching gray suits. The surprise wedding was sensational enough to suit the rock star, recently described as “the indisputable lead Jonas” in W Magazine. But this was no whirlwind secret romance: Fans started posting images of the couple together in 2016. In October 2017, they announced their engagement with corresponding Instagram posts. Each shared an image showing Turner’s pear-shaped engagement ring. Despite its quirk and camp, the Las Vegas wedding may have been as practical as it was spontaneous. Now that they are legally married in the United States, the couple is free to have the more formal wedding fans were expecting this summer in France. (Joe mentioned plans for the summer wedding during an interview on “The Late Late Show With James Corden” in March. A month later, he told “The Zach Sang Show’s” audience he would be marrying in France.) If a second wedding ceremony is in the works for Joe and the newest Mrs. Jonas, they will be following in the footsteps of his younger brother. But possibly with fewer sequins, and dresses, and everything. In December, Nick married Priyanka Chopra, 36, an actress, singer and former Miss World, in a pair of lavish ceremonies, both in India, after a July engagement. The couple said their “I dos” first in a Christian ceremony Dec. 1 at the Umaid Bhavan Palace in Jodhpur; Kevin and Joe, as well as the youngest Jonas, Frankie, were groomsmen. The next day at the palace, they hosted an official Hindu ceremony for 400. Both weddings were preceded by a Mehendi, a traditional Indian celebration during which henna is applied to the bride’s hands and feet, and by a Sangeet, another traditional Indian prewedding event. Ms. Chopra’s wedding dress for the Christian ceremony was custom made by Ralph Lauren and covered in more than two million mother-of- pearl sequins. Topping it was a 75-foot veil that could have doubled as the world’s largest and fanciest tarp. Nick wore a black double-breasted tuxedo, also custom-made by Ralph Lauren. For the Hindu ceremony, Ms. Chopra wore a hand-embroidered fire-engine red lehenga with hand-cut organza flowers, French silk knots and crystals, according to the Indian designer Sabyaschi’s Instagram post. The groom accessorized his gold hand-quilted silk sherwani with a diamond necklace and Christian Louboutin shoes. (And oh would we be remiss to not at least mention the couple’s royally camp appearance on the Red Carpet at this year’s Met Gala, where Joe and Sophie also brought their own Viva Las Vegas style.) But back to the stateside wedding reception for Nick and Ms. Chopra, which was at Nellie’s Southern Kitchen, a restaurant in Belmont, N.C. That party was inspired by the Jonas brothers’ late great-grandmother, was held in January, extending the festivities to 2019. This may have been enough celebrating for Nick. During a recent episode of “Carpool Karaoke” Mr. Corden, the host, asked him, “Was there a point during your many weddings that you thought, ‘I’m done with these weddings?’” Nick admitted there was, adding, “It was when I looked at the bill.” By comparison, Kevin Jonas’s 2009 wedding to Danielle Deleasa was a bit more low key, though it took place during a December snowstorm. The couple, now the parents of two daughters, married at Oheka Castle, a French-style chateau on a sprawling estate in Huntington, N.Y. Kevin’s brothers were by his side. As his bride approached in a Vera Wang lace and tulle gown, Kevin, wearing a black tuxedo, fought back tears. He couldn’t have known at the time that his wedding, with its enchanted forest theme, would one day seem tame compared with his brothers’. And neither did his brother Joe during a toast to the newlyweds at the reception. “This is crazy,” he said of the elaborate setting. “I can’t top this.” A previous version of this article misstated the beauty pageant title of Priyanka Chopra. She is a former Miss World, not Miss Universe.",The New York Times
2019,When Neon Owned the Night,"Past Tense Glitz, grit and the vintage glow of urban America. Vegas Vic, an icon of the Las Vegas strip. Jan. 19, 1985.CreditCreditScott Henry for The New York Times Before evolution hit a snag, and we reverted to slouching and staring at our phones, human beings walked with their eyes up, looking at things. In the countryside, people contemplated church steeples, maple trees, clouds. In cities, they gaped at neon — and it was everything. Between the 1930s and the 1970s, neon signs were a potent American symbol for both glamour and depravity, hope and desolation. In movies, how many star-struck ingénues have gazed up at the bright lights of Broadway? How many down-and-out characters have checked into a seedy hotel and found a malfunctioning sign buzzing like a bug-zapper outside their window? “I love the chaotic nature of a street full of different lights,” Anna Castellani, managing partner of DeKalb Market Hall, told The Times in 2017 during a neon revival. “You feel like you’re in the city.” Something about the audacity of that light has always seemed uniquely urban. It’s glow big or go home in the neon wilderness. In 1898, the Scottish chemist William Ramsay was collaborating with an English colleague, Morris Travers, when he discovered an inert gas, naming it “neon” after the Greek word for “new.” He went on to win a Nobel Prize for his work, though it did not occur to him to use his discovery to sell theater tickets or beer. It was the French inventor Georges Claude who sensed a new industry in the offing. Mr. Claude unveiled a neon light at the Paris Motor Show in December 1910, and went on to create all manner of signs for clients. By the 1930s, New York was ablaze with color, and Times Square was an enormous flame toward which countless moths fluttered. “Visitors, too, arrive in New York to witness the nightly Vesuvius-like eruption of light,” Richard F. Shepard wrote in The Times decades later. “They may patronize the theaters, movie houses, restaurants and bars, or they may not, being content merely to walk between 42nd and 47th Streets taking in the brilliant show only a tilt of the head above them.” Though it’s often associated with size and spectacle, neon is a craftsman’s medium: Glass tubes are warmed so that they can be shaped by glassblowers. Later, they’re filled with gas, which glows when electrified. Different gases (neon, argon, mercury, helium, etc.) produce different colors, giving sign-makers a palette to choose from. During its heyday in New York, neon signage made people long to chew Wrigley’s Spearmint gum, to smoke Camels, to put on a tuxedo and have a cup of Maxwell House coffee poured for them by a butler who was also wearing a tuxedo. Las Vegas didn’t fully embrace neon until after World War II, but made up for lost time quickly: Nobody had to tell them not to be subtle. Neon’s greatest selling point — that it could shout so much louder than anything else — ultimately made it seem a little desperate, a little tacky. As the 20th century rumbled on, the signs became synonymous not with the boldness and variety of cities, but with their supposed dangers and temptations. Maybe anything that wanted your attention that bad should be avoided? In the 1960s, with the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, urging “beautification” of the nation, some towns passed anti-neon ordinances. Even more damaging for neon was the fact that backlit plastic signs were being manufactured cheaply by that time. On January 4, 1966, The Times ran a sort of obituary for the neon Camel billboard that had been blowing smoke rings at Broadway and 44th Street since 1941. “I’d walk a mile for a Camel,” it read. Was it really possible to mourn the passing of a cigarette ad? It was — because everything about the billboard was redolent of an era. It was a time when neon was king, a time when it apparently didn’t occur to anyone that if you were that dependent on Camels you might not be able to walk a mile. Douglas Leigh, who had designed and owned the sign, said he rented it to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for about $10,000 a month. “It breaks my heart to lose this one,” he told The Times. “That sign was a tradition. People went out of their way to see it.” That’s the way it was with neon. While it burned, it burned brightly.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | When One of the World’s Most Visible Athletes Is Told She Can’t Be One,"I wish we heard more about women’s spectacular victories than their testosterone. Ms. Crouse, an editor with Op-Docs, has completed 11 marathons. Just two days after a rule was upheld that would prevent her from competing in her best event, Caster Semenya cruised to a victory over an elite field in the 800 meters in Doha on Friday. It was a fitting — and wonderfully characteristic — response to a ruling by the Court Arbitration for Sport that will go into effect on Wednesday, prohibiting her from racing against women in that event unless she reduces the level of natural testosterone in her body. And it encapsulated how Semenya, a gay black woman from a South African township, has dealt with a decade of almost unimaginable adversity: with the kind of poise and stoicism few of us are able or ever compelled to muster. While there’s no easy answer to the broader debate about who belongs in women’s sports, it’s spectacularly unfair that Semenya has had to endure this toxic combination of racism, sexism and homophobia; the court even admitted that its ruling discriminates against her. No one disagrees. We can only speculate about how she feels when she’s forced to expose her own body to astonishing degrees of invasive scrutiny, and is called a man and far worse. That’s because she keeps quiet. But we do know how she works: She races to win, she shakes her opponents’ hands and she follows the rules. Meanwhile, she stays true to herself. And she perseveres. Her ability to behave like this — to endure — is a trait of real champions, athletic and otherwise. We should celebrate her demonstration of character just as we do for our other heroes. Her fight is just as great a feat. As is her athleticism; it’s a shame that we hear more about the hormone levels of one of the most decorated female athletes today than her achievements. Paradoxically, Semenya has become one of the world’s most visible female athletes right when she’s being told she can’t be one. She’s impeccable (she has to be), exhibiting all the qualities of sportsmanship we look for in athletes, regardless of whom they race. What’s more remarkable is that, Semenya, and her determination to keep showing up, are forcing us to pay attention to female athletes, and the extent to which we value them. That attention has been scant. One recent survey found that 0.4 percent of sports sponsorships go to women. And when was the last time a woman’s track race featured prominently in news coverage? Who aside from a handful of enthusiasts can name the other women in photos of the starting lines in Semenya’s 800-meter races — the ones that would take her place on the podium? One of those women is the Olympian Kate Grace. She was in a photo of a 2016 race that accompanied a New York Times Instagram post about the court’s ruling this week. The photo showed Semenya winning a qualifying heat for the 800-meter final at the Olympics in Rio, with Grace behind her, in third place. To Grace, that photo has a different significance: It showed, she told me, “the moment in the last 10 years that most altered my life.” “I’m behind her, grimacing to finish,” she added. “I’m about to run 1:58 in the 800 meters, a personal record, to nab the qualifying spot for the Olympic final.” Just a year earlier Grace had been too injured to run. So, for her, that photo is a depiction of her validating an entire athletic career. That’s what we should celebrate, for all the women involved. But that moment is getting exposure now only because of the focus on Semenya, not because of all those women’s accomplishments. If Semenya ends up being unable to compete in the 800 meters, there is plethora of talent to fill the void. Beyond Grace, there is Ajee Wilson, the American who won the bronze medal at the most recent World Championships. There are also Grace’s teammates on the Bowerman Track Club, Colleen Quigley, Courtney Frerichs and Shelby Houlihan, whose names have been in The Times exactly once and who are aiming to qualify for the Olympics next year, with help from their other teammate Shalane Flanagan. We should care about all of them. Without Semenya, we wouldn’t be seeing them or talking about them right now. Of course we can debate Semenya’s testosterone levels, and we should debate how we should define who belongs in women’s sports, if we want to preserve them. (And we do; even Semenya wouldn’t be able to rival men on the global stage.) But those debates alone aren’t going to save women’s sports. Watching them, and investing in them, and being fans of them will. Let’s celebrate these women more often than just when we’re telling Semenya she can’t run with them. Meanwhile, Semenya has said this: “I know that the I.A.A.F.’s regulations have always targeted me specifically. For a decade the I.A.A.F. has tried to slow me down, but this has actually made me stronger. The decision of the C.A.S. will not hold me back. I will once again rise above and continue to inspire young women and athletes in South Africa and around the world.” It’s ironic that there is such an outcry over a sport that’s relatively ignored in the first place. Yet this referendum on the value of women’s sports could be good for it, and Semenya’s dignity amid such adversity is an example of why we should love women’s sports in the first place.

2019,When Pokémon Go 3-D,"The makers of “Detective Pikachu” had to work out how Psyduck’s oversize eyes fit in a small head, among many challenges. (And they stand by the title character’s fur.) Fleshing out two-dimensional cartoons into 3-D characters for a hybrid of live action and animation is far from child’s play. Just ask the makers of the coming “Sonic the Hedgehog,” who vowed to redesign their version of the beloved video-game critter after outraged fans got a look at the trailer and vehemently objected online to its humanlike teeth. “It’s super easy to fall flat on your face,” Erik Nordby, the visual effects supervisor for “Pokémon Detective Pikachu” (due May 10), said in a recent telephone interview. “The fans are in their 20s now and grew up with these characters.” So the filmmakers spent a year — about twice the usual prep time for a project like this — redesigning the roughly 60 Pokémon from the anime series. In this comic mystery, the titular yellow sleuth (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) helps a young man investigate the disappearance of his father in a city where people and monsters live side by side. Nordby explained how five of the film’s most prominent Pokémon were reimagined: “Whenever you have an extraordinarily simplistic face shape, which is essentially a flat yellow pancake, the challenge to get any real emotion out of it without feeling cartoony is huge,” Nordby said. “We shot Ryan doing a whole series of facial expressions and mapped those onto Pikachu’s face. Then we worked on it for six months until we got it right.” Devising the detective’s body was equally challenging. First, the potentially controversial decision was made to cover him with fur, for maximum cuteness. “Then we became amateur zoologists and scoured the world for analogous animals that actually exist,” Nordby said. The closest parallel to Pikachu? Wombats. “They’re so fat and adorable.” Not everything about Pikachu is rooted in reality, however. Take his deerstalker cap, which was a carry-over from the “Detective Pikachu” video game that was first released in Japan in 2016 and inspired the film. “It made no sense because how could it ever stay on?” Nordby asked. “And he can’t actually put it on — his arms are not long enough. So who the hell puts his hat on?” That’s a mystery even Sherlock Holmes might not be able to solve. Vulnerable to stress, the angst-ridden sidekick to a reporter is constantly on the verge of exploding. Much of that anxiety is expressed in his oversize eyes, but they had to be scaled down because “they couldn’t fit inside his skull,” Nordby said. The other obstacle for Psyduck was figuring out how to keep up with the fast-paced action, given his short legs. That’s why they came up with the backpack the reporter carries him in, Nordby said. “Originally we laughed at the idea, but it ended up working quite well.” The dragon-ish monster that faces off against Pikachu in one of the film’s biggest battles had to feel legitimately threatening without losing the character’s essential appeal. “He’s got a fat-guy-in-a-suit vibe, with a bit of a potbelly,” Nordby said. In the original design, “the wings aren’t quite long enough or wide enough to fly, so we had to make them twice as large.” And to ensure that Charizard seemed believably menacing, the effects team added crocodilian scales to his skin. A gaggle of these friendly, bulbous creatures come to Pikachu’s rescue, falling all over one another. “We took a series of clips of bulldog puppies jumping on top of each other and copied their movements with a rotoscope,” Nordby said. “The playfulness and top-heaviness you have with bulldogs, where they don’t quite seem like they’re ever quite comfortable on their feet, worked really well with the body shape of the bulbasaur.” The right-hand monster to the police detective played by Ken Watanabe is “a big pink fluffy mix of a rabbit with a bulldog’s face,” Nordby said. The director, Rob Letterman, instantly loved the design, but getting the O.K. from the Pokémon Company in Japan proved more difficult. “From a Western point of view, you look at it and go, ‘This is the most adorable thing on the planet,’” Nordby said. “From their point of view, they kept using the word ‘scary.’” A lengthy negotiation led to an agreement on a revision, splitting the difference between cute and creepy. “The entire process was a series of compromises, but the movie is better for it,” he added. “When our first trailer came out, we were very nervous, but there were all these videos online where you could see fans reacting with this childlike wish fulfillment. We wanted to root this in the real world, so these kids who had grown up and always wished they had their own Pokémon could now see a film that made them feel like they could reach out and touch them.”",The New York Times
2019,Stonewall: When Resistance Became Too Loud to Ignore,"Critic’s Picks New York City museums and public spaces celebrate Stonewall and the movement’s charismatic personalities in a handful of timely shows. Celebrants outside the Stonewall Inn. From “Art After Stonewall, 1969-1989,” at the Grey Art Gallery.CreditCreditFred McDarrah/Getty Images, via Pavel Zoubok Gallery At times the fight for civil rights is a straight road pocked with speed bumps; at other times a maddening spiral of detours. It was a battlefield in the early hours of June 28, 1969, when a small group of gay, lesbian and transgender people, herded by police out of a Greenwich Village bar called the Stonewall Inn, just said no: shoved back; threw bricks, bottles, punches. As the police defensively barricaded themselves inside the bar, the fight — since variously termed a riot, an uprising, a rebellion — spread through the Village, then through the country, then through history. It’s still spreading, expanding the way the term “gay” has expanded to include lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer and other categories of identity. And for this summer’s half-century Stonewall anniversary, substantial displays of art produced in the long wake of the uprising are filling some New York City museums and public spaces. The largest of them is the two-part “Art After Stonewall, 1969-1989” shared by Grey Art Gallery, New York University, and the Leslie-Lohman Museum in Soho. A trio of small archival shows at the New-York Historical Society adds background depth to the story. And at the Brooklyn Museum, “Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall,” 28 young queer and transgender artists, most born after 1980, carry the buzz of resistance into the present. Grey Art Gallery and Leslie-Lohman Museum This survey, organized by the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio, where it will later appear, is split into two rough chunks defined by decades, with material from the ’70s mostly at Leslie-Lohman and from the ’80s at Grey. Unsurprisingly, the Leslie-Lohman half is livelier. A lot of what’s in it was hot off the political burner when made, responsive to crisis conditions. The modest scale of the gallery spaces makes the hanging feel tight and combustible. And as a time of many “firsts,” the early years had a built-in excitement. There was, of course, the thrill of the uprising itself, captured by the Village Voice beat photographer Fred W. McDarrah in an on-the-spot nighttime shot of protesters grinning and vamping outside the Stonewall. (One of them, the mixed-media artist Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt has sparkling, tabletop-size sculptures in both sections of the show.) Activist groups quickly formed, and a way of life that had once been discreetly underground pushed out into the open. The Gay Liberation Front, aligning itself with antiwar and international human rights struggles, coalesced within days after Stonewall, soon followed by the Gay Activists Alliance, which focused specifically on gay and lesbian issues. It was clear pretty fast that both were predominantly male, white and middle class — misogyny, racism and classism have plagued L.G.B.T. politics from the start — and further groups splintered off: Radicalesbians, Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), and later, the Salsa Soul Sisters. All the energy produced, among other things, the first Christopher Street Liberation Day March (now the NYC Pride March). Many of the Stonewall-era trailblazers, like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera — one black, the other Latinx, both self-identified drag queens — were longtime veterans of the West Village gay scene. But for many other people the event prompted a first full public coming out, which was no light matter. In 1969, even mild affectional acts between same-sex couples were illegal in much of the United States, as was cross-dressing. An arrest — and there were many — could instantly end a career, destroy a family, shut down a future. Bullying gay men was considered normal; violence was acceptable. As a gay person, you went through the world watching your movements, monitoring your speech, worrying about how much of yourself, just by being yourself, you were giving away. This could make for a lonely life. If, for some reason, you were heedless, or incapable, of acting straight, good luck to you. So when safety arrived in the form of an army of out-and-proud lovers and protesters, the relief was tremendous. And you can feel the rush of at Leslie-Lohman, in photographs of the first marches in New York and Los Angeles taken by participants like Cathy Cade, Leonard Fink, Diana Davies, Kay Tobin Lahusen (who, in a wall label, is credited as being the first openly gay American woman photojournalist). Particularly strong among these images is Bettye Lane’s shot of a raging Sylvia Rivera confronting a jeering gay crowd — they had just been applauding an anti-trans speech by the lesbian feminist leader Jean O’Leary — at the 1973 New York march. But no picture can compare in gut-level impact with the short glitchy surviving video of Rivera in action that day. (You can find it on YouTube. I urge you to watch it.) Women and transgender people are the heart of the Leslie-Lohman half of the show, not only in its documentary components but in the art chosen by the curator Jonathan Weinberg, working with Tyler Cann of the Columbus Museum of Art and Drew Sawyer of the Brooklyn Museum. Standouts include a Tee A. Corinne-designed coloring book consisting of exquisite line drawings of vulvae; Harmony Hammond’s sculpture of two clothbound ladderlike forms leaning protectively together; and Louise Fishman’s 1973 “Angry Paintings,” acts of controlled gestural chaos that name heroic lesbian names (the critic Jill Johnston, the anthropologist Esther Newton, Ms. Fishman’s partner at the time) and speak of emotions once suppressed, now released. The Grey Gallery half of the show, which brings us into the 1980s, makes a quieter impression. Partly this is because of a more spacious installation spread over two floors, and to the more polished-and-framed look of much of the work. Political content is, with vivid exceptions, subtle, indirect, which is not in itself a bad thing, though an earlier charge of communal energy is diminished. We’re basically now in a different, more market-conscious, canon-shaping art world, one closer to the museum than to the street. And though we’re in the era of AIDS, the sense of urgency that absolutely defined that time is missing. This is not to say there’s a shortage of good work. The show would be valuable if it did nothing more than showcase artists like Laura Aguilar, Luis Cruz Azaceta, Jerome Caja, Lenore Chinn, Maxine Fine, Luis Frangella and Marc Lida, all seldom, if ever, seen in New York now. Here again photography opens a window on cultural histories that would otherwise be lost to memory. Dona Ann McAdams’ shots of performances at the lesbian-feminist W.O.W. (Women’s One World) Café, and other East Village clubs, are reminders of the radical talents — John Bernd, Karen Finley, Ishmael Houston-Jones, Holly Hughes, Tim Miller — that this brief time and vanished environment nurtured. In the end, though, it was two text-pieces, familiar but reverberant, that stayed in my mind. One, a 1989 print by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, was originally enlarged to billboard size and installed on Christopher Street, near where the Stonewall Inn still stands. It’s plain black field is empty except for two unpunctuated lines of small white type read, as if floating up from delirium: “People With AIDS Coalition 1985 Police Harassment 1969 Oscar Wilde 1895 Supreme Court 1986 Harvey Milk 1977 March on Washington 1987 Stonewall Rebellion 1969.” The other piece is a 1988 poster designed by the AIDS activist collective Gran Fury. In large letters it commands us to “Take Collective Direct Action to End the AIDS crisis.” In smaller type it acknowledges that, “With 42,000 dead, art is not enough.” In an ethically pressurized political present, it’s a message I find myself carrying away from a lot of recent contemporary shows. New York University Bobst Library With the Stonewall Inn — now a national monument (and a bar again; it was a bagel shop in the 1980s) — in its neighborhood, New York University has scheduled several additional events around the anniversary, among them a homegrown archival exhibition called “Violet Holdings: LGBTQ+ Highlights from the N.Y.U. Special Collections,” on view at Bobst Library, across the park from Grey Art Gallery. Organized by Hugh Ryan, it tracks the history of queer identity back to the 19th century with documents related to Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952), an American actor, suffragist and friend of Virginia Woolf, forward with material on pathbreaking organizations like the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis, and close to the present in the form of ephemera associated with the musician and drag king Johnny Science (1955-2007), and the D.J. Larry Levan (1954-1992), who, in the 1980s, presided godlike at the gay disco called the Paradise Garage, then a short walk from the N.Y.U. campus. New-York Historical Society The Paradise Garage, or “Gay-rage,” has high visibility in “Letting Loose and Fighting Back: LGBTQ Nightlife Before and After Stonewall,” one of a cluster of dense micro-show at New-York Historical Society. The club’s metal street sign is here, along with some theme-dance fliers, and a mash-note drawing of Levan by Keith Haring. A matchbook from working-class lesbian bar called the Sea Colony, is a souvenir of 50s butch-femme culture in New York. A key fob and a flip-top lighter are relics of gay male sex clubs, like the Anvil and the Ramrod, that sizzled in the ’70s. So plentiful were such pleasure emporia that some activists feared they were sapping the strength of goal-oriented gay politics. Yet activism is the essence of a second show, “By the Force of Our Presence: Highlights from the Lesbian Herstory Archives,” which documents the founding in 1974 — by Joan Nestle, Deborah Edel, Sahli Cavallaro, Pamela Olin, and Julia Stanley — of a compendious and still-growing register of lesbian history. The items on view represent a small part of the whole but still suggest the arc of a larger story driven by charismatic personalities. And personality-plus is what you get in a set of separate solo homages to such out-and-proud imperishables as Stormé DeLarverie (1920-2014); Mother Flawless Sabrina/Jack Doroshow (1939-2017); and Rollerena Fairy Godmother (born 1948). All three, for decades and in different ways, served the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community, as guardian angels (Ms. DeLarverie, a biracial male impersonator, worked as a bouncer at lesbian bars); style models (Ms. Flawless was impresaria of countless drag pageants); and cheerleaders (who could forget the delight, in the ’70s, of seeing Rollerena, purse in hand, whizz by?). Brooklyn Museum As it happens, Ms. DeLarverie is stage center in this notably youthful and history-conscious — and history-correcting — survey at the Brooklyn Museum. The museum commissioned the artist L.J. Roberts, self-identified as genderqueer, to create a Stonewall monument for the occasion. Ms. DeLarverie is the subject the artist chose to honor, both as a power of example and as a figure whose role at Stonewall — some accounts have her landing the first punch on intruding police — has been obscured. In the sculpture, a construction of light boxes on bricks, her image appears repeatedly, along with those of Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. (A monument commemorating both will be placed in the vicinity of the Stonewall Inn.) Rivera, who died of cancer at 50 in 2002, and Johnson, who was found dead in the Hudson River in 1992 (her death, ruled suicide at the time, is still under investigation), are further saluted in a video docudrama by Sasha Wortzel and the artist Tourmaline, and in a bannerlike sequined hanging by Tuesday Smillie. Friends in life, the two historical figures are tutelary spirits of an exhibition in which a trans presence, long marginalized by mainstream gay politics, is pronounced. It’s here in the work of the queer graffiti artist Hugo Gyrl, in the diarylike photographs of Elle Perez (a participant in the current Whitney Biennial), in the vivid memorial portraits of murdered trans women by the painter David Antonio Cruz, in the songs of Linda LaBeija, in the internet-based work of Mark Aguhar, a femme-identified transgender artist who died in 2012; and in the hand-sewn textile protest signs of Elektra KB. For many reasons, protest is a logical direction for art right now. There is still no federal law prohibiting discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q.+ people on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity (although some states and cities have enacted laws prohibiting it).

2019,When Survival Depends on the Little Things,"solver stories After tragedy struck, solving crosswords allowed estranged sisters to find a way back to each other. All homes are the same; all homes are different. For the first decades of my life, home was a three-bedroom apartment, full of warmth and tucked safely away in a close-knit Igbo community in the eastern part of Nigeria. The neighborhood night-patrol crew kept us all safe at night, and everyone knew all about everyone else’s business. Fathers gossiped about their errant sons in the evenings, as they sat around and drank in groups, while their wives tended to their cooking pots. All the kids ran up and down the streets, and the little boys and girls whose mothers had teasingly proclaimed were “made for each other” exchanged shy peeks, looking away quickly lest anyone caught them. Onyinyechi is my sister, younger by three years. Even back then she was different from the rest of us. She was light-skinned to my darker complexion, slim to my chubby. My sister found it amusing that I wailed the first time we watched The Lion King. She would routinely go “missing” when we kids played our neighborhood game of tag in the evenings, and she’d rather wash and rewash plates than play kitchen with me in our backyard with my empty tins of milk. As we grew, she read James Hadley Chase and Nora Roberts while I still struggled with Chinua Achebe, and she won more competitions all through school than anyone else in our family. Onyinyechi had the foresight to save up her pocket money while in boarding school and during the long holidays, she signed up for a class in creative writing, which of course she aced. Unlike me, when her time came, she was firm in her decision to pursue a degree in law, and it was no surprise to anyone when she gained admission into the university the first time she tried, with her scores way above the cutoff marks. She was a difficult younger sister to have because we had so little in common. My struggles to measure up and surpass her abilities were frustrating and for quite some time, we did not get along. We lived together briefly at the University of Nigeria Nsukka — I was in my final year and she was a freshman law undergraduate — and during this time, I noticed her interest in crossword puzzles. It was impossible not to. Circling new words on torn-out pages of local newspapers was something she did most nights, especially when she was edgy or upset about something. It served as a sort of therapy when she could not verbalize what was bothering her. But it was the crossword puzzles she liked the best. She would sit cross-legged with her back to the wall, at the right corner of our bedroom, directly beneath the torn flap of our old wallpaper. With her reading glasses perched atop her nose, the torn-out page of the newspaper delicately balanced on her legs and a slight frown creasing her forehead, she would carefully begin to fish out the hidden words inside the boxes, oblivious to everything else that moved. I didn’t care about crosswords at the time, but I came to recognize these moments as special. I gave her the silence and space she needed by studying in the living room, and tiptoed around until she had finished. Shortly after my graduation, the activities of violent student gangs on campus got a lot bolder. They were called “cultists,” and students reported waking up in the middle of the night to shouts and brawls between various groups. Male students began to participate in strange rituals and in meetings up in the neighboring hills that sometimes left one or two of them dead in the bushes come morning. Onyinyechi was in her third year at the university when she was robbed and sexually assaulted by a cultist. She fell apart in ways no one can ever be prepared for. She could neither eat nor sleep, and for the longest time, none of us back home even had the slightest clue of what her life had become. I was working late the night she called, and she began by taking loud quivering breaths over the phone to steady her nerves. By the end of our talk, my heart was breaking, and I was sobbing into my palms, seated on a night bus set for Nsukka. My first priority was to get back to her. We filed a formal police report and, after many weeks and an arrest, I watched her slowly begin to pick up her pieces, as women often have to. To help deal with her pain, she took early morning strolls — often coming back puffy-eyed from tears that wouldn’t stop — but she reserved her crosswords for nighttime, when the nightmares kept her from sleeping. I sat up whenever she tore out the pages, and I would sit on the floor next to her. I, too, began to find the hidden words, any words that would help bring her home. When she had finished and gone to bed, I would stay awake a bit longer and try to leave messages of encouragement in the folded corners of the puzzles we’d solve next, where I knew she would find them. During the day, I bought more local newspapers and pestered my colleagues at work until they gave up their old ones as well. I deposited these with her in the evenings and was happy to hear her little laughs as she playfully made them into piles, because sometimes survival depends on these little things. Each night, in the pauses before a new word is declared found, we revisited old memories, and she thanked me for whatever kind words I had tucked away to cheer her up on that day. She shared her shame at the violence she had suffered, the feelings of worthlessness she couldn’t control and, when the tears came, I held her hand over the open pages of the newspaper and didn’t let go. Eventually, she sniffled and picked up her pen again. Her healing took time, but she survived, and she is now the best friend I never thought I’d have. It’s been a few years. She bagged that law degree and is currently working on her first novel. I am a single mom of one, and a few months ago, my son and I moved in with her to save up money to live on our own. Onyinyechi directly translates as “God’s gift” in my native language, and she has been nothing short of that to me and my son. Every now and then, I come across days that are poised to kill; moments that coil heavily and tightly around my neck to test my faith. Sometimes a brighter future for me and my son seems just out of reach. When days like this call, I wait until nighttime for my son to fall asleep, and I lean on my sister’s shoulders to talk or cry. And after the tears, we resume our cross-legged sitting positions facing each other, and having fetched a local newspaper from the pile, we place the torn-out crosswords page between our folded legs and hunt for the hidden words until our eyes grow drowsy with sleep. Because sometimes, survival depends on these little things. Linda Egbuna is a Nigerian lawyer by day and a writer by night.

2019,When Travelers Bring Skin Infections Back as Souvenirs,"Personal Health As more people travel abroad, travelers and doctors need to be alert to unusual and often perplexing skin infections. A 5-year-old girl was brought to the emergency room at Evelina London Children’s Hospital with itchy, rather unsightly sores on both legs. She had recently returned from a weekslong trip to Sierra Leone, and the lesions, which first appeared three weeks into her stay there, had become larger and ulcerated. Diagnosis: cutaneous diphtheria, a disease rarely seen in many industrialized countries, including Britain and the United States, where most children are protected by the diphtheria toxoid vaccine, DTaP, and a booster shot of the tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine, Tdap. Still, as more and more Americans of all ages travel abroad, often to less developed areas, travelers and doctors in this country need to be alert to unusual and often perplexing skin infections. Even though cutaneous diphtheria is not a notifiable disease here, between September 2015 and March 2018, four cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patients, two from Minnesota and one each from Washington and New Mexico, had recently returned from Somalia, Ethiopia and the Philippines, respectively. The C.D.C. noted in its weekly report in March that reported cases of this highly contagious infection had recently increased 10-fold, from an average of only three a year during the period 1998 to 2011, to 33 a year during 2012 to 2017. Still, the agency said, these numbers underestimate the true incidence of such infections. Although the four new cases were confined to the skin, the lesions can be a source of a life-threatening respiratory infection in people not adequately immunized against diphtheria. Thus, everyone who might have had close contact with the patients needed to be checked, perhaps treated with antibiotics, and if they lacked immunity to diphtheria, immunized with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. Before traveling to developing countries, people often check with the C.D.C. or a travel health clinic to determine what immunizations they may need to update and which health precautions — like drinking only bottled water — are recommended. But having visited some pretty wild areas in the last five decades, I know that many people neglect to consult travel health experts in advance of their trips and are lax about updating needed vaccines. Upon returning home with a health complaint, they often consult physicians who may have never seen the condition before or even heard of it since medical school, if then. While emerging diseases like SARS and Ebola rightly garner widespread attention, Dr. Jay S. Keystone of the Toronto Medisys Travel Health Clinic has noted that “skin problems are among the most frequent medical problems in returned travelers.” In a large series of traveler-related skin problems analyzed by the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network, Dr. Keystone reported that among ill travelers who sought medical care, cutaneous larva migrans, insect bites and bacterial infections were the most common disorders, making up 30 percent of 4,742 cases. He added that the reported cases did not include those that were easily treated during travel or that cleared up on their own — probably many more. Chances are, when you go to less-developed lands, you’re most concerned about avoiding traveler’s diarrhea (try chewing two tablets of bismuth subsalicylate — Pepto-Bismol or generic versions — with each meal). But to help assure a medically uneventful trip, you’d be wise to remain alert to avoiding various bacterial, parasitic, viral and fungal infections that enter through the skin and are rarely encountered in the United States. Cutaneous larva migrans, an extraordinarily itchy infection by the larval stage of a hookworm, is most commonly acquired from dog or cat feces deposited on beaches of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia, Dr. Keystone said. Best protection: Don’t walk barefoot on the beach; wear water shoes, not sandals. The infection, should it occur, is now easily treated with oral antiparasitic drugs like albendazole or ivermectin. Some infections are transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes, like malaria, dengue fever and filariasis, the risk of which often can be greatly reduced by diligent use of the insect repellents that can protect against various disease transmitters. In an interview, Dr. Keystone, who wrote the chapter on skin and soft-tissue infections in returned travelers in the C.D.C.’s travel health guide, called the Yellow Book, urged the use of either Icaridin (picaridin) or 50 percent Deet, both of which can provide up to 10 hours of protection. He said Icaridin is better tolerated; it smells better and is not greasy. Most important, he said, is to use the repellent regularly, especially during the hours mosquitoes are most active, and apply it after putting on sunscreen, not before. These repellents can also protect against tick bites, which in this country and elsewhere can carry Lyme disease, among other miseries. Also helpful is applying permethrin to one’s clothing and gear, including pants, socks, boots and tent. Or purchase pre-treated clothing. The protection will last through multiple washings. I once returned from a safari in Kenya with intensely itchy chigger bites on my legs, acquired while standing in tall weeds at the edge of a lake to photograph flamingoes. These tiny larvae, which hang out on leaves and branches, may also carry infectious bacteria that make people very sick, Dr. Keystone said. Beach lovers who vacation in the Caribbean and other sandy areas (including along American shores) can be bitten by sand flies, so tiny they’re rarely seen. Though these flies usually cause no more than an extremely itchy bite, sometimes they carry a parasite that causes leishmaniasis that can infect internal organs as well as the skin. Deet is an effective repellent against sand flies, but it’s also a good idea to avoid beaches soon after a rain. Other helpful tips to avoid travel-related infections: Don’t touch, pet, handle or feed animals, including wild ones, strays and other people’s pets. If at all possible, sleep in air-conditioned or screened rooms and use a bed net if you sleep in an area exposed to the outdoors. Even the most prevention-conscious travelers are not guaranteed full protection against the myriad creatures that are waiting to dine on them. If your destinations include malaria areas, insect repellent is not enough. Taking an antimalarial drug is critical and should be started before your trip. For last-minute travelers, Malarone can be a good choice. Finally, well in advance of traveling, make sure your vaccine protection is up-to-date. And in case some critter bites or burrows into you, pack some reasonable first-aid items, like antiseptic wipes, an antimicrobial ointment, an anti-itch cream with at least 1 percent hydrocortisone and perhaps an antifungal product, especially if you will be in remote areas. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the way leishmaniasis is spread. The disease is spread by sand flies, not sand fleas.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | When Trolls and Crybullies Rule the Earth,"How technology reshapes consciousness. Opinion Columnist Over the past several years, teenage suicide rates have spiked horrifically. Depression rates are surging and America’s mental health over all is deteriorating. What’s going on? My answer starts with technology but is really about the sort of consciousness online life induces. When communication styles change, so do people. In 1982, the scholar Walter Ong described the way, centuries ago, a shift from an oral to a printed culture transformed human consciousness. Once, storytelling was a shared experience, with emphasis on proverb, parable and myth. With the onset of the printing press it became a more private experience, the content of that storytelling more realistic and linear. As L.M. Sacasas argues in the latest issue of The New Atlantis, the shift from printed to electronic communication is similarly consequential. I would say the big difference is this: Attention and affection have gone from being private bonds to being publicly traded goods. That is, up until recently most of the attention a person received came from family and friends and was pretty stable. But now most of the attention a person receives can come from far and wide and is tremendously volatile. Sometimes your online post can go viral and get massively admired or ridiculed, while other times your post can leave you alone and completely ignored. Communication itself, once mostly collaborative, is now often competitive, with bids for affection and attention. It is also more manipulative — gestures designed to generate a response. People ensconced in social media are more likely to be on perpetual alert: How are my ratings this moment? They are also more likely to feel that the amount of attention they are receiving is inadequate. As David Foster Wallace put it in that famous Kenyon commencement address, if you orient your life around money, you will never feel you have enough. Similarly, if you orient your life around attention, you will always feel slighted. You will always feel emotionally unsafe. New social types emerge in such a communications regime. The most prominent new type is the troll, and in fact, Americans have elected a troll as the commander in chief. Trolls bid for attention by trying to make others feel bad. Studies of people who troll find that they score high on measures of psychopathy, sadism and narcissism. Online media hasn’t made them vicious; they’re just vicious. Online has given them a platform to use viciousness to full effect. Trolls also score high on cognitive empathy. Intellectually, they understand other people’s emotions and how to make them suffer. But they score low on affective empathy. They don’t feel others’ pain, so when they hurt you, they don’t care. Trolling is a very effective way to generate attention in a competitive, volatile attention economy. It’s a way to feel righteous and important, especially if you claim to be trolling on behalf of some marginalized group. Another prominent personality type in this economy is the crybully. This is the person who takes his or her own pain and victimization and uses it to make sure every conversation revolves around himself or herself. “This is the age of the Cry-Bully, a hideous hybrid of victim and victor, weeper and walloper,” Julie Burchill wrote in The Spectator a few years ago. The crybully starts with a genuine trauma. The terrible thing that happened naturally makes the crybully feel unsafe, self-protective and self-conscious to the point of self-absorption. The trauma makes that person intensely concerned about self-image. The problem comes from the subsequent need to control any situation, the failure to see the big picture, the tendency to lash out in fear and anger as a way to fixate attention on oneself and obliterate others. Crybullying is at the heart of many of our campus de-platforming and censorship outrages. Trolling, crybullying and other attention-grabbing tactics emerge out of a feeling of weakness, and create a climate that causes more pain, in which it is not safe to lead with vulnerability, not safe to test out ideas or do the things that create genuine companionship. The internet has become a place where people communicate out of their competitive ego: I’m more fabulous than you (a lot of Instagram). You’re dumber than me (much of Twitter). It’s not a place where people share from their hearts and souls. Of course, people enmeshed in such a climate are more likely to feel depressed, to suffer from mental health problems. Of course, they are more likely to see human relationship through the abuser/victim frame, and to be acutely sensitive to any power imbalance. Imagine you’re 17 and people you barely know are saying nice or nasty things about your unformed self. It creates existential anxiety and hence fanaticism. Two words loom large in this moment: trauma and equity. Trauma is living with the aftershocks of a bad event — or, more important, it is having no place to go where the aftershocks can be healed because the public conversation is unsafe. Equity is the dream of a world in which all are given equal attention and dignity. The dream is still out there, but it’s receding with every vicious attack done in its name.

2019,When Twyla Tharp Made Ballet Modern,"On the occasion of American Ballet Theater’s revival of the game-changing “Deuce Coupe,” Ms. Tharp and Sara Rudner talked with the dancers taking their roles, Isabella Boylston and Misty Copeland. (Yes, it’s O.K. to fall.) Twyla Tharp at a rehearsal of “Deuce Coupe.”CreditCreditKarsten Moran for The New York Times Twyla Tharp threw down a gauntlet in 1973: She mixed classical and modern dance to make the first crossover ballet, “Deuce Coupe.” It was a revolutionary work, and to pull it off she needed both the Joffrey Ballet and her own company. Its impact still reverberates through the dance world. “‘Deuce Coupe’ said, O.K. look, we have modern dance over here and we have ballet over here and we have this big void in between,” Ms. Tharp said. “Why is there this gully in dance? I think everybody should be able to do everything.” Set to songs by the Beach Boys — pairing pop music and ballet wasn’t the norm, either — “Deuce Coupe” was the introduction to a different world for Ms. Tharp too. Before its premiere, she said, she had never taken a bow. When she was handed a bouquet of flowers during the curtain call, she threw it back. This season American Ballet Theater presents the company premiere of “Deuce Coupe,” part of the “Tharp Trio” program (May 30-June 4) that also includes “The Brahms-Haydn Variations” and “In the Upper Room.” “Deuce Coupe” melds styles, but never loses its underlying groove. It’s wild and reckless, elegant and refined. Throughout, a ballerina calmly executes the ballet vocabulary in alphabetical order. The other dancers are like waves churning around her. Even at a run-through in the studio, “Deuce Coupe” has an incandescence that has nothing to do with nostalgia. For “Catch a Wave,” the dancers slide dangerously, even defiantly across the floor; the solo, “Got to Know the Woman,” originated by Sara Rudner and now danced by Misty Copeland, is seductive and earthy, a statement of female strength. In “Don’t Go Near the Water,” eight women line the back of the stage and give way to improvisatory, twisting spurts of motion. Ms. Tharp remains among the very few female choreographers to have had a lasting influence on ballet. Her Ballet Theater program — a retrospective of sorts — shows how she integrated modern dance into the ballet vernacular (“Deuce Coupe”) and then expanded that mission (“In the Upper Room”) and, finally, made the two forms into a seamless new movement language (“The Brahms-Haydn Variations”). Recently, Ms. Tharp and Ms. Rudner sat down with Isabella Boylston and Ms. Copeland, the dancers performing their original parts in “Deuce Coupe,” at Ballet Theater’s studios to talk about the revival. It was lively — on occasion, their voices tangled together as they spoke over one another — but certain points became clear: How important is it to work with the artist who actually created a ballet? Very. And how scary is it to step into the roles of two of the finest dancers of their generation, classical or otherwise? Ditto. Ms. Boylston, in Ms. Tharp’s part, keeps falling. “That’s O.K., you’re going for it,” Ms. Tharp told her. “I’ll have to teach you how to fall if you’re going to do that.” She had more advice too: Ms. Boylston and Ms. Copeland should keep a spoon and peanut butter in their lockers — fast nourishment for brutal rehearsal schedules. More important, Ms. Tharp said, she wants them to realize that they “are now the experts” on “Deuce Coupe.” “It becomes you,” she said. “It’s not Sara anymore, it’s not me anymore, it’s you.” And that is how a ballet is reborn. What follows are edited excerpts from our conversation. What do the ballets on the program have in common? TWYLA THARP The three pieces are actually about the same thing: What’s classical, what survives, what’s important and what’s going to last? That is the big question. Is your longevity there? What was foremost on your mind in bringing back “Deuce Coupe”? SARA RUDNER Accuracy, accuracy, accuracy. I had to relearn my parts from the beginning, and things that were just so natural are like, how’d she do that? It was a lot of analytical work, but it really paid off, because we gave everybody a really firm basis from which to begin and then create their own phrasing and timing. But the framework is as solid as we could make it. What has it been like to learn and dance “Deuce Coupe” so far? ISABELLA BOYLSTON After we learned the steps we got to watch a little bit [of archival video], and Twyla is such a force. I’m just watching this thinking there is literally no way I can recreate what she did, so I feel like it’s been very much like starting from scratch and very collaborative. I feel like I had a turning point in the past two runs where I hit another level. I think I was going from “Am I doing this right?” to “I’m doing it.” Sara, talk about the “Woman” solo. How have you passed that along to Misty? RUDNER I danced as much as I could at the beginning with Misty. Physically, it was very exhausting for me. Getting on my feet and doing that movement over and over and over. Getting all the accuracies going on and what were the oppositional actions, where’s the head? MISTY COPELAND No matter what we were doing, I was always trying to find you in the studio — your eyes, because I wanted to be, “Is this right?” It just feels so real and authentic. The way we grew up hearing music and dancing — just in the club or something — is so much about your hips. There’s such a different way of moving in “Deuce Coupe.” It was so hard for me to articulate at first. THARP It’s the difference between something that’s truly sexy and something that’s manufactured sex, as in Madonna sex. It’s not Madonna sex — this is the real deal. RUDNER Has doing this dance infected your own dancing? COPELAND Absolutely. The human connection that we often overlook — no matter what style of dance we’re doing — is something that I’ve taken from this process. It can enrich an entire piece to acknowledge and relate to people and see them. BOYLSTON Also, it feels very adult to me. THARP Oh, this is getting good. Adult porn. No more kiddie porn. BOYLSTON [to Ms. Copeland] I love that you’re in heels for your “Woman” dance. I love that dance and Misty in it — she’s just so in her own world. It’s so cool. A woman in control of her body. What has been the most difficult quality to get back? RUDNER I would say the underlying strength and ease, knowing where your weight is, having a strong leg — but also the upper body actually is working polyrhythmically. The head is going one way, and the arms are going another. COPELAND I’ve been working with a new teacher and trying to retrain myself, which is crazy. Twyla has been saying the same words to me for years, but now I can hear them: It doesn’t matter what type of movement I’m doing, the same rules apply. I think my natural instinct — when I’m not doing classical dance — is to be hunched over and not open, and so it’s been fascinating to be given the same exact corrections from Twyla in the movement in “Deuce Coupe.” How would she correct you? COPELAND “Lift your back up. Put your shoulders down and stay open, hold your center, turnout. Make a decision!” [Laughs] And I think because we haven’t had that base in training with modern dance that it’s this idea of what we think it is, and then it becomes contrived. THARP It becomes an approximation of what modern dance is. But the reality is that a well-trained classical dancer can do it all. You just have to tell them what part to move. BOYLSTON The way Twyla throws herself onto the ground. She’s not afraid of going down. THARP The Graham technique has a lot of different approaches to falls, and I studied with Martha for a year and I studied in the studio for three years, so I knew a lot about falling. And also the clowns. I’m a clown. I have always been a clown, and I will always be a clown. Clowns are very close to God. They know how to get down. BOYLSTON Oh my God. Is that why you picked me to do your part? THARP Partially, yes! I knew you had it in you. But I’m still waiting. I’m still waiting for the [Buster] Keaton to get out, but I know that you can do it. Do you think this ballet has changed you? COPELAND [Firmly] Yes. It couldn’t be more perfect timing in my career and my life to be able to absorb this information, or just have an understanding or acceptance of myself about what I want to be and what I’m capable of. THARP It’s always about creating artists, right? About creating the possibility for somebody to become an artist. Not simply a dancer. There’s nothing the matter with dancers. They’re great, and some of them are phenomenal athletes, but an artist is a person who thinks for themselves, uses what they have that they recognize and is willing to take their own chances. That’s the person that we want to see develop in the studio.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | When Will Eric Garner Get Justice?,"Mayor de Blasio owes Mr. Garner’s family — and the city — answers. Ms. Gay is a member of the editorial board. As Eric Garner lay dying, he was gasping for air and bleeding in his neck and eyes. The arm of a New York City police officer was pressed hard against his throat. When the medical examiner described Mr. Garner’s last minutes in the small, airless courtroom at Police Department headquarters, police officers, news reporters and family members of Mr. Garner drew sharp breaths. Some cast their eyes to the floor. One woman wept as the man beside her gently stroked her back. Mr. Garner’s family has seen no justice in the five years since his death. Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Mr. Garner in a chokehold during the fatal arrest in July 2014, never faced criminal charges after a grand jury on Staten Island, one of the most police-friendly areas of the city, declined to indict him. Mr. Pantaleo not only remained on the force but also saw his income rise after Mr. Garner’s death, collecting a 35 percent increase in overtime pay the following year, even though he was on modified duty. The federal civil rights investigation into the death fell into a dispute between federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and veteran civil rights prosecutors in Washington over whether to file charges. The attorney general at the time, Loretta Lynch, ultimately authorized prosecutors to move ahead toward indictment, but problems with the initial F.B.I. investigation delayed the case until after President Trump took office. At long last, however, Mr. Pantaleo is standing for a departmental trial, on charges brought by the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board. The review board accused him of reckless use of a chokehold and intentional restriction of breathing. If a judge finds him guilty, his fate will reside with the police commissioner. The disciplinary hearing, which is being held at Police Headquarters, in downtown Manhattan, has forced a brutal reassessment of a dark moment in the city’s history. It also serves as a visceral reminder of the cost of refusing to hold the nation’s largest police department accountable when something goes wrong. On Thursday, when lawyers showed the court an exchange of text messages between a sergeant at the scene of the deadly arrest and a supervising lieutenant, we learned how warped we have allowed the city’s policing culture to become. “He’s most likely DOA,” the sergeant wrote in a text message to Lt. Christopher Bannon. “Not a big deal,” Lieutenant Bannon replied. “We were effecting a lawful arrest.” New York has made considerable progress in its policing practices over the years, but there still is not adequate accountability when abuses arise. One reason is that the department, understandably, has gotten the credit for one of New York’s greatest successes: a celebrated, decades-long drop in crime. Another is that the department took on a nearly heroic status after the Sept. 11 attacks, which is also understandable. The department also enjoys the political power that comes with having the nation’s largest police union. These forces have cemented the Police Department’s nearly untouchable status in city politics. Mayor Bill de Blasio learned this when hundreds of cops turned their backs on him at the funerals of two police officers killed by a man who had spouted anti-police vitriol. The officers were angry that a few months earlier Mr. de Blasio had the audacity to say that the Garner case made him think of the possibility of losing his biracial son in an encounter with the police. Rudy Giuliani was able to ride the Police Department’s political power to win the 1993 mayoral election, whipping up racist sentiment among the force to unseat Mayor David Dinkins, the city’s first and only black mayor. Sometimes, deference to the Police Department comes with a price. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s unquestioning support of the overbroad use of stop-and-frisk under Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, for instance, threatened to tarnish Mr. Bloomberg’s legacy. Wary of the N.Y.P.D’s power, New York’s mayors have largely allowed the 36,000-officer force to police itself. What other possible explanation is there for allowing the department to handle Officer Pantaleo with such kid gloves over the past five years? Mayor Bill de Blasio and his police commissioners initially said they would await the outcome of a federal civil rights investigation into the death before moving forward with any disciplinary measures. Yet, at the trial this week, the public learned that the department’s own internal affairs investigators found that Officer Pantaleo had used a banned chokehold on Mr. Garner, and they were ordered by a supervisor to recommend that the department bring disciplinary charges against him. But the Police Department never brought those charges, even after it was clear that federal prosecutors had dropped the ball. Why not? Mayor Bill de Blasio owes the Garner family and the public an explanation. Mr. de Blasio also vowed to retrain the entire police force in the wake of Mr. Garner’s death. But half a decade later, the data shows that officers are still using chokeholds, and that they rarely face serious punishment for doing so. Few have paid a higher price for the city’s refusal to take police abuse seriously than the family of Eric Garner. In 2017, Erica Garner, Mr. Garner’s daughter, died of a heart attack at the age of 27 after years of activism against police brutality in the aftermath of her father’s death. Gwen Carr, Mr. Garner’s mother, has been relentless. This week, she brought earplugs to the trial so she wouldn’t have to hear her son’s cries for help as a video of his arrest played in the courtroom. Outside Police Headquarters on Thursday, Ms. Carr said she wouldn’t rest until the officers involved were off the force. “They do not think of us New Yorkers as human beings,” she said. Ms. Carr is right. Eric Garner deserved better, and so do we. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Opinion | When Your Money Is So Tainted Museums Don’t Want It,"Nonprofits should not allow themselves to be used by the wealthy to scrub their consciences. Mr. Giridharadas is the author of “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.” When it comes to blood money for the arts, how bloody is too bloody? On Wednesday, the Metropolitan Museum of Art decided that money made from selling the opioids that have killed several hundred thousand people is too bloody. It announced it would no longer take donations from members of the Sackler family linked to OxyContin. “On occasion, we feel it’s necessary to step away from gifts that are not in the public interest,” Daniel H. Weiss, the Met’s president, said. “Gifts that are not in the public interest.” It is a pregnant, important phrase. Coming on the heels of similar decisions by the Tate Modern in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the spurning of Oxy-cash seems to reflect a growing awareness that gifts to the arts and other good causes are not only a way for ultra-wealthy people to scrub their consciences and reputations. Philanthropy can also be central to purchasing the immunity needed to profiteer at the expense of the common welfare. Perhaps accepting tainted money in such cases isn’t just giving people a pass. Perhaps it is enabling misconduct against the public. This was the startling assertion made by New York State in its civil complaint, filed in March, against members of the Sackler family and others involved in the opioid crisis. It accused defendants of seeking to “profiteer from the plague they knew would be unleashed.” And the lawsuit explicitly linked Sackler do-gooding with Sackler harm-doing: “Ultimately, the Sacklers used their ill-gotten wealth to cover up their misconduct with a philanthropic campaign intending to whitewash their decades-long success in profiting at New Yorkers’ expense.” It was strong stuff: The State of New York was officially claiming that in taking Sackler money, arts institutions had allowed themselves to be used as lubricant in a death machine. “It’s a remarkable statement,” Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy at the Urban Institute in Washington, told me this week, “the sort of thing we heard from critics of philanthropy on the periphery of power but rarely, in recent decades, from those at the center.” Are museums, opera houses, food pantries and other nonprofits to be held responsible for how their donors have made their money? It is a question being asked more and more as a century-old taboo shatters. “No amount of charity in spending such fortunes can compensate in any way for the misconduct in acquiring them,” Theodore Roosevelt said after John D. Rockefeller proposed starting a foundation in 1909. It was not a lonely thought at the time. But in the decades since, not least because of the amount of philanthropic coin that has been spent (can it still be called bribing when millions are the recipients?), touching all corners of our cultural life, attitudes have changed. And, as I found in spending the last few years reporting on nonprofits and foundations, a deeply complicit silence took hold: It was understood that you don’t challenge people on how they make their money, how they pay their taxes (or don’t), what continuing deeds they may be engaged in — so long as they “give back.” When I speak privately with people working in nonprofits, as I often do, especially younger people, I hear this complaint again and again: They agonize about having to stay quiet not only about their donors’ membership in a class that has benefited from an age of inequality but also about specific conduct by many donors that often worsens the problems the donors and nonprofits are working to solve. And so the decision by the Met and the other museums may be a small sign that this compact is cracking — and perhaps that nonprofits are taking a broader view of their role in public life: not only as doers of good in a particular area of work but also, if they’re not careful, as enablers of broader, if more generalized, societal harm. “Turning down money runs against the grain of the thinking that’s long governed charitable boards — that they are stewards of the interests of particular institutions, with considerations of broader public interest being peripheral,” Mr. Soskis, the historian, said when I asked him about the Met. “What we are seeing more and more of, through the spread of social media, and an increased willingness to critically engage major philanthropic gifts, is the assertion of the public’s interest in the philanthropic exchange.” It remains to be seen whether other arts institutions will follow the lead of the Met, Tate and Guggenheim — and more broadly, whether the nonprofit sector will begin asking itself some deeply uncomfortable questions. Should anyone working to make cities better and more equitable take money from JPMorgan Chase, which paid a huge sum for its role in helping to bring about the 2008 mortgage disaster and financial crisis? Should anyone working to help families affected by President Trump’s immigration policies take money from Mark Zuckerberg, whose soft-pedaling of Russian interference in the 2016 election allowed anti-immigrant hate to spread and potentially helped Mr. Trump gain votes? Should any health institution take money tied to Pepsi or Coca-Cola? Make no mistake: To ask these questions opens a can of worms. The Sacklers are an easy case. Once the complicity turns more diffuse, it is hard to say whether a nonprofit is participating in an injustice by taking money — or doing the best it can in a flawed reality. What’s next after this? Is there a statute of limitations on looking for blood money? What kind of moral purity test are these institutions supposed to use? Once you begin to raise these dilemmas, how do you actually draw those lines around what’s acceptable? The Met has already drawn some lines. It won’t remove the Sackler name from its galleries; it won’t return money already donated. What it should do is go beyond a single act of rebuffing to model a new process for evaluating money. Past and future donations could be judged on various criteria: Was the money legally and fairly made? Is the money owed to tax evasion or extreme legal tax avoidance? Is the museum effectively selling a modern papal indulgence for a sin that shouldn’t be so easily pardoned? Does the donor have a duty of reparation to people they have exploited or harmed that gives those parties more of a right to the money? And the public should be brought into the process. Public-facing institutions enjoy the privilege of being untaxed, so citizens should be able to comment on and scrutinize prospective donations. These questions will long be with us. These museums have forced an essential conversation. For far too long, generosity has been allowed to serve as a wingman of injustice; giving back disguises merciless taking; making a difference becomes inseparable from making a killing — sometimes literally. It is high time to reject these alibis for treachery.

2019,When Your Vacation Happily Goes to the Dogs,"Trending Animal centers and humane societies in popular travel destinations are organizing walks with rescue dogs. ‘It’s a win, win, win, win.’ A crescendo of barks greeted a vehicle that recently pulled up to the Montego Bay Animal Haven in Jamaica. Penned dogs — 147 of them — were tipped off it was time for their morning walk. They leapt at the chain link fence, tails wagging, then surged in joyous waves through a gate. Dog-loving visitors, in expendable clothing, climbed out of the van to welcome the onslaught with laughter, no fear. “Hiking with the Hooligans” began as a tourist activity in January, a raucous way to enjoy Jamaica’s hilly countryside flush with ackee, guava, mango and papaya trees. There are no sea views from this inland sanctuary; the dogs grab all the attention. The hourlong hike is rugged, not a day at the beach, so wearing flip-flops would be a mistake. Tammy Browne, the haven’s founder, was inspired after visiting Territorio de Zaguates (Land of the Strays) in Costa Rica last year, a no-kill sanctuary with hundreds of dogs roaming the land (it is currently closed to the public). Since Ms. Browne’s 17-acre property in Jamaica is enclosed, the dogs are unleashed for the hike. The panting pack sociably trots together, the shelter’s guides breaking up the occasional disagreement. Charlie Brown had three legs. Albus was missing an eye and part of his tail. Stallone’s head was furrowed with scars; his street-wise gravitas commanded respect from the other dogs. To the untrained eye, those lacking distinctive features looked pretty much alike, but Ms. Browne knew all their names. She had rescued them from the streets or abusive owners and nursed them back to health. They are spayed and have the relevant vaccines. “I hate the word mongrel,” Ms. Browne said. “Royal Caribbean terriers, I call them. Every dog you see has a story, the most horrendous background.” She said she has found homes for hundreds of dogs since she founded the nonprofit shelter in 2009 and “adoptions are up tenfold since we started the hike, more in the last two months than we had in the last year.” Another 43 dogs were back at Ms. Browne’s house in various states of recovery, limiting her time, so the daily hikes are handled by a local entrepreneur and Airbnb host, Irina Bruce. The $65 cost for the hike includes the 30-minute ride from downtown Montego Bay, bottled water and protective outerwear if necessary. “It’s a win, win, win, win,” Ms. Bruce said. “Good for the dogs to get exercise, good for guests, good for the people who run the shelter and good if a dog gets adopted.” For more details go to www.montegobayanimalhaven.com. The puppy socialization walks along Grace Bay Beach are solely for the benefit of the dog, stressed Jane Parker-Rauw, the charity’s director, adding, “No dog is a souvenir.” Still, adoptions have increased fivefold since she started the walks in 2011. “Potcakes” are mixed breeds, named for the burned scrapings of peas and rice the locals feed them. Ten to 15 are ready for walks Monday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. The program is free. “My goal is to be run out of business,” she said. Mirah A. Horowitz, the shelter’s executive director, estimated three to five adoptions each month are the direct result of a family taking a dog out through their “Field Trips” program. Eight to 10 healthy dogs are usually available and eager for beach breaks (poop bags provided). The leash stays on even for swims together. Check kauaihumane.org for daily pickup times (closed Wednesday) and the suggested donation is $25. Credit cards will be charged a $200 deposit in the event the dog is not returned. Explore Central Maui through the “Beach Buddies” program every Wednesday and Friday, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Five pooches (one per family) are generally available for outings in nature or to dog-friendly restaurants. Sign up in advance by emailing beachbuddies@mauihumanesociety.org. There is a $20 suggested donation. Hurricane Irma deluged the shelter in 2017 with more than 300 lost or surrendered animals; the majority were adopted or reunited with their families. In April, only nine socialized strays were available for daily leashed walks to nearby Cruz Bay. “In the last five or six years it’s really taken off, a lot of it to do with our social media following,” said Ryan Moore, the shelter’s manager. Reach the center by calling 340-774-1625 or emailing info@stjacc.org. For anyone missing a dog back home or looking for a companion to stroll with on the beach, roughly a dozen rescue dogs here would jump at the chance. It’s free, Thursday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. For more information, email viequeshumanesociety@hotmail.com. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,When a College Student Is Home for the Summer,"Adolescence Adding college students back into family life is rarely as simple as rebooting their high school days. Birds aren’t the only creatures migrating in spring. In May, many college students swoop home for the summer, landing with their loads of dirty laundry and cravings for the comforts of home. As glad as we may feel to have our children return to the nest, adding them back into family life is rarely as simple as rebooting their high school days. Finding a new equilibrium usually requires work on all sides, but the process can be smoothed when parents and teenagers alike bear in mind that they are entering a new and unfamiliar phase of the parent-child relationship. Adolescence and young adulthood are marked by tremendous personal growth, so it should come as no surprise that the child who returns from college is not the same as the one who left. Some changes will be entirely welcome. Anna Yarinsky, an 18-year-old freshman at Vanderbilt University, wants “to try to be more helpful around the house” this summer. Accordingly, she's planning to help with buying groceries and making dinner now that she's back with her family in Manhattan. Other developments will be easy enough to absorb. While away at school, Jackie Green, a 20-year-old junior at The Ohio State University, traded the meat and pasta of her childhood for a diet of fish and vegetables. “My mom is pretty accommodating, and willing to make new things,” she explained, “but the rest of the family isn’t into the food that I like.” They came to a compromise. A couple nights each week, the family has fish and vegetables while Ms. Green is home with them in Orlando, Fla. “And my mom said that if there was anything I really didn’t want, she wouldn’t make that while I’m around.” The rest of the time, they eat as they always have. “But it’s all right,” Ms. Green said, “a decent balance.” And some shifts may test family bonds. Hawk Anderson, a 22-year-old senior at the University of California, Riverside, from San Diego, was initially disowned by his mother, his primary parent, when he came out as bisexual at age 19. “Through patience and time and my own hard work, I’ve been able to reconnect with my mom,” he said. We cannot always know the nature or scale of the changes we’ll be greeting when our college students return home, but we can prepare for their return by remembering that young adults are, by their nature, unfolding. Isabel Beach, a 20-year-old junior at Barnard College, observed that when she’s with her family in Homer, Alaska, “I’m the only one on break — everyone else is still working.” Indeed the rhythms of family life — with younger siblings who are still in school and parents who go to work each day — don’t always harmonize with the routines of a college student who may still be recovering from finals and keeping odd hours. So it would not be surprising if there is some friction in the window between the return from college and the beginning of summer jobs, internships or travel plans. It can help to have a conversation about expectations, maybe saying that it’s O.K. to spend a few days on the couch eating Doritos, if it’s done with respect for established family patterns. After months of independence, it can be an adjustment for young adults to be expected to pick up after themselves or text us if they’ll be missing dinner. Jac Guerra, a 19-year-old freshman at Brandeis University who will soon return home to Guilford, Conn., reflected that he is “going to have to remember that my mom doesn’t want dirty dishes in the sink.” Fitting back into family life can be especially awkward for college students whose bedrooms have been claimed by younger siblings, or who have lost their exclusive access to a car. While most young adults don’t expect that their high school life will be preserved in amber, a little empathy on parents’ part can still go a long way. Saying something along the lines of, “We appreciate that you’re not used to sharing a car with your sister — let’s figure out new routines that meet everyone’s needs,” may help ease the transition home. It’s important for parents to remember that their returning students sometimes need support around experiences they may not have mentioned in texts or weekly phone calls, from helping a roommate who has blacked out from drinking to facing psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. For a college student who is among the more than three million teenagers using nicotine through vaping, an attempt to stop upon arriving home for the summer may cause increased moodiness and irritability. If you feel the need to adopt a “no smoking or vaping under my roof” policy, you may want to offer some resources to help your young adult break the addiction to nicotine as house rules are not always enough to get someone to quit. Young adults who have gotten used to not having to account to anyone else for their behavior may chafe at parents’ restrictions around alcohol or expectations that they will revert to high school curfews or even that they will routinely wake up in their own beds. It can be valuable to lay out clearly what your expectations are at the start of the summer, from “Please let me know if we’re out of milk” to “Just text us if you decide to sleep over at a friend’s” — and revisit them as new wrinkles emerge. Rules are always unique to each family, but it’s a solid guideline to remember that responsibilities and privileges often go hand in hand. When we ask our older children to carry more of the weight that comes with keeping a household in order, we can reasonably extend more privileges to them as well. Parents should not be surprised when returning children seem to care more about attending to their high school friendships than communing with us. It may feel insulting, but it might be a compliment: They trust that we’re not going anywhere, but they often harbor a sense of anxiety, longing or both with regard to their hometown peers. Mr. Guerra is returning home apprehensive about seeing his high school friends. “I’m nervous about whether we will be able to hang out as comfortably as we used to, or whether they will have met people in college they connect with more.” In contrast, Ms. Yarinsky can’t wait to catch up with old friends. “Last summer, we spent a lot of time being angsty about college and sad to leave each other,” she said. “I’m excited to be with them without that hanging over us.” We also shouldn’t be surprised when returning college students rush to visit much-missed hometown spots. Ms. Beach knows the hike she’ll take as soon as she returns to Alaska, Ms. Yarinsky has her sights set on her favorite Manhattan cafe and Mr. Guerra plans to climb a particular bluff overlooking the Long Island Sound as soon as he gets home. Instead of taking it personally when our adult children are more excited to stop by a beloved pizza joint than join us for dinner, we might take this as a vote of confidence in the strong relationships we’ve built — and maintained — with them. “I can have a sense of family in other places,” Mr. Guerra said, “but I can’t replicate the feeling of being at the top of that bluff anywhere else.”",The New York Times
2019,When a Dream Job Means Less Money,"work Friend In this week’s column: How to handle a double-edged opportunity, and when it’s O.K. to ask a boss about a colleague’s pay. (Never!) CreditCreditEmily Simms for The New York Times Send questions about the office, money, careers and work-life balance to workfriend@nytimes.com. Include your name and location, even if you want them withheld. Letters may be edited. What is the protocol for negotiating salary in a market with a dramatically lower cost of living? I’ve been putting off a potentially amazing position in a different state because I currently live in New York City and assume the jump would require a pay cut. While I understand costs would be lower, taking on the upheaval of the move doesn’t seem worth it without continuing to advance in terms of salary. — J., New York City To answer your stated question first: The protocol for negotiating salary in a market with a lower cost of living is the same as that for any other salary negotiation. Research the market for the role you are up for and ask for a number at the top of that range. But now to answer your unstated question: Salary, of course, is just one part of the equation. When considering a job, it’s important to think about a host of other inputs, from potential for advancement, to affinity with colleagues, to the quality of benefits on offer. It can be hard to get a pay increase when leaving New York, which, if I may draw on the cliché of fish and pond, is a veritable ocean of capital and talent. So take pay out of the equation for a minute and think about the role: Is it more senior than the last? Will you be a bigger fish, albeit in a smaller pond? Will you gain valuable experience? A better title? A higher profile in your field? I understand not wanting to spend the rest of your adorable fish life swimming in boring circles in a filmy little bowl, but if you’re midcareer and the job is a step up, there is a good chance you’ll one day be released back into an ocean, or at least a pleasant lake. And when that time comes, you will again be able to ask for a salary at the top of the market for your role. Ka-ching. Mmm, fish food! I’m a female who has been with a medium-size company for five years. The company has no protocol for regular performance and salary reviews, although a plan is in the works. May I ask my boss whether my salary is at least equal to that of a man my age who has been there longer, but who doesn’t have as much experience as I do and by all accounts does not do great work? If so, what is the best way to ask? Or simply to ask if there is a policy of equal pay for equal work? — C.W., Pa. Everyone, and I mean everyone, needs regular performance and salary reviews! What is it with you bosses, disorganized and too scared of your own employees to deliver a review! Get it together, bosses! That said, no, you should not ask your boss whether your salary is at least equal to that of a man your age or of anyone else who works at your firm. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for salary transparency. But it’s not strategic for you to compare yourself directly to a co-worker and put your scattered and/or cowardly boss on the spot. What you can do, however, is ask friends who work in comparable roles elsewhere what kind of salaries they make. You can also study the market for your role online. Heck, you can even apply for some jobs in your field and see if you get an offer. These methods will tell you as much or more about what you should be making as asking your boss directly about a co-worker’s salary. It’s easy to get distracted by what is right in front of us, like Twitter or less competent colleagues. But remember to keep your eye on the prize, which, in the case of your salary, is what will end up in the bank. Don’t compare yourself directly to others in the workplace. (Or log on to Twitter, ugh.) I’ve been in the work force for decades, before email was the bane of our existence. I used to pride myself on keeping all the balls in the air and staying super organized. But once I had a child 16 years ago, that went away. Every year I tell myself I’ll get more organized and stay on track. I try different things: lists, apps, etc. But once the list is made, it’s so overwhelming I don’t want to deal with it and end up getting sucked into easy stuff like answering emails and reading social media. I get a lot done, but I feel like I’m getting nothing meaningful done. I desperately want something meaningful to do. Suggestions? — K.G., Calif. Welcome to the club! And thank you! Because if it weren’t for people like you, which is basically everybody, the work-advice business would be out of business. In our era, it’s internet addiction, but before that there was paper-shuffling addiction, and addiction to dialing up rotary phones — you name it. And kids can be so gosh-darned cute. Because I’m part of everybody, and even though for 13 weeks now I’ve been doling out work advice, I too feel hopelessly addicted to the internet and often rudderless and out of sorts. Because that is what it means to be a human in our time. I’ll tell you what I tell my friends and also myself on a good day: Just accept who you are. You’re enough! Accept the internet addiction and the dispersal of your energies between family and work, and the anxiety about ecological collapse. (If you’re not feeling it yet, you’ll feel it soon.) There are some things you can do, like calling your representatives and listening to the young activist Greta Thunberg, whose job it is to read scary reports on behalf of politicians and rich people who can’t read. You can also “eat the frog,” which is a colorful way of saying you should try to do the hardest task first, like, say, mobilizing at least $1 trillion globally per year to remake our energy system. But let’s face it: Life is short. Temporary assignments for major international newspapers are short! Children grow up in the blink of an eye. And we have to start aggressively reducing our emissions. I have accepted that this is my last column in this run. Really! I’m O.K. with it! I hope you can likewise accept your own mortality, and the fact your internet addiction is here to stay. Until then, it has been an absolute pleasure being your Work Friend. I hope you’ll stay in touch, or at least keep my résumé on file in case a more appropriate position opens up at a later date. And now it’s time to eat that frog.

2019,When a Tornado Threatens: Safety Tips and Where to Shelter,"Strong storms sweeping across the Plains and Midwest over the past two weeks have spawned a wave of destructive tornadoes, including a cluster that touched down in Kansas and Missouri Tuesday evening and at least 10 in Ohio the previous night, wrecking houses and causing at least one death. Tuesday was the 12th consecutive day when at least eight tornadoes were recorded in the continental United States, breaking a record. Hundreds of the storms have struck since mid-April. On Tuesday, tornado watches were also posted in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. And forecasters said severe storms with the potential to generate tornadoes were possible in several regions of the country later in the week. Here’s what you can do to stay safe when tornadoes are threatening your area, based on recommendations from the National Weather Service and other experts. [Read more about the relentless storm season in the Midwest.] • Stay alert for watches and warnings. A “watch” means conditions are right for a tornado to form somewhere in a wide area; a “warning” means one has definitely been sighted nearby. Monitor local news broadcasts and online alerts; listen for sirens if they are used in your area. One good source to check regularly: The National Weather Service’s special tornado Twitter feed. • When a watch is posted, get ready. Have a plan and make sure everyone in the family knows what it is. Don’t forget to plan for pets. Secure outdoor objects that might become dangerous in a high wind, like lawn furniture and gas grills. Have any prescription medicines ready to take with you to shelter. • When a warning is posted, head for cover right away. You may have only a few minutes to reach safety. [In this high-tech nerve center, experts work around the clock to predict and track tornadoes and alert the public.] • If you are indoors: The cellar or basement, or if there is none, an interior room without windows on the lowest floor. Stay near the center of the room. Avoid large, open indoor spaces like school cafeterias and shopping malls. • If you are outdoors: The sturdiest building you can reach quickly. Avoid sheds, storage facilities and other lightly built structures. • If you are driving: Don’t try to ride out the storm in your vehicle if you can help it. Get into a building, or failing that, try to find shelter in a low-lying area like a ditch or ravine. If you have no other option, get down as low as you can in the car. • Wherever you are, cover up, especially your head. Television forecasters often recommend wearing a bicycle helmet if one is available. Get under a sturdy piece of furniture like a desk or workbench, or cover your body with a sleeping bag or mattress. [See photos of the damage caused by deadly tornadoes in Missouri last week.] • Stay informed. Keep monitoring local news, alerts, watches and warnings. There may be more storms coming, or other hazards from severe weather like hail, lightning and flooding. • Check in. Let family and friends know how you are faring. Text messages and social media posts may be most effective. • Tread carefully in assessing damage. Protect yourself with sturdy shoes, long pants and long sleeves. Be alert for hazards like downed power lines, broken glass, sharp or jagged metal debris and damaged propane tanks. Look up as well as down, for possible danger from damaged trees and utility poles.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | When a Traffic Ticket Costs $13,000","Suspending driver’s licenses for unpaid fees buries poor people in debt. Ms. Dindial is lawyer for the A.C.L.U. Mr. Lampard is a lawyer for the American Legislative Exchange Council. For most people living in America, transportation is central to daily life. About 83 percent of Americans report that they regularly drive a car multiple times a week. Yet millions of drivers across the country have had their licenses suspended — taking away their ability to drive to work, school, the grocery store or the doctor — essentially because they are poor. In 2014, Leah Jackson was ticketed for obstructing traffic in Otsego, Minn., after turning left at a red light. That kind of thing happens to many people. But, as Ms. Jackson explained to state lawmakers in 2018 testimony, she had just started a new job and hadn’t yet received a paycheck, so she couldn’t pay the $135 fine right away. A few months later, she was pulled over, told her driver’s license was suspended for an unpaid ticket and cited for driving with a suspended license — a new $200 ticket. Her job responsibilities as a retail store manager required her to make bank runs and other deliveries, so she kept driving in order to keep her job. In less than a month, she received two more tickets for driving with a suspended license. After accounting for the additional tickets and the resulting increase in her monthly insurance premiums, her debt from the initial infraction spiraled into more than $13,000 over four and a half years. The criminal justice system too often produces a self-perpetuating cycle, particularly for the poorest people, who can’t pay fines or hire lawyers to make charges go away. In 39 states, you can lose your driving privileges if you’re unable to pay a court fine or fee, for things as minor as a traffic violation. But a bipartisan effort is growing to end the fundamentally unjust practice of wealth-based suspensions. On May 7, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana signed a bill to eliminate wealth-based driver’s license suspensions. Montana joins the District of Columbia and a handful of states, including California, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi and Virginia, that have recently stopped suspending driver’s licenses for unpaid debt. State legislatures in Illinois and Oregon are expected to vote on whether to end the practice in their states later this month. The American Civil Liberties Union and the American Legislative Exchange Council, which typically take conflicting positions on policy debates, are aligned on this issue: Driver’s license suspensions should be imposed for the limited purpose of keeping unsafe drivers off the road, not as a debt-collection mechanism. State legislatures, courts and motor vehicle administrators should work together to eliminate laws and policies that permit driver’s licenses to be suspended for reasons unrelated to a person’s ability to drive, including nonpayment of fines and fees. Suspending people’s driver’s licenses because they can’t afford to pay fines or fees is unfair. The A.C.L.U.’s position is that it is unconstitutional. It’s also just bad policy. Wealth-based suspensions are at best ineffective and at worst destructive to the purpose of ensuring compliance with unpaid debt. They also drain resources that could otherwise be used to enforce laws that protect communities from drivers who engage in behavior that could actually threaten public safety, such as drunken driving. Union County, Ohio, found that driving-while-suspended violations cost an average of nine hours of officer and court time. That’s valuable time that could be spent advancing public safety rather than collecting debts from people struggling to make ends meet. Stripping people of their driver’s licenses makes it more difficult for them to earn a living and, by extension, more difficult for them to pay off their debts. A 2011 study found that in New Jersey, 42 percent of drivers who lost their licenses also lost their jobs. In Phoenix, people who lost their licenses lost an average of $36,800 of annual income. Most people in the United States have limited access to reliable public transportation, so driving is often their only realistic means of transportation. The reality is that many people who drive with suspended licenses do so out of necessity. In the process, they risk additional fines, fees and even incarceration, all of which make it extremely difficult for them to pay their outstanding court debts. One of the concerns of opponents of this type of legislation is that eliminating a punishment for nonpayment of court debt will result in a decrease in revenue that courts and other government agencies depend on to finance their operations.

2019,Opinion | When the Levees Break Again,"New Orleans, its flood protections verging on obsolete, lives on the edge of disaster. Mr. Horowitz is writing a book on Hurricane Katrina. NEW ORLEANS — Saturday is the official start of hurricane season. And the Army Corps of Engineers recently predicted that our levee system may soon be obsolete. The corps announced in April that, because of global sea level rise and because Louisiana is sinking, “risk to life and property in the greater New Orleans area will progressively increase” without substantial improvements. As early as 2023, the levee system may no longer protect New Orleans and its suburbs against a so-called 100-year storm, or a hurricane with a 1 percent chance of happening here each year. We might expect such a storm soon. But we may feel the effects of the levee system’s decline evens sooner. That’s because our flood protections must be certified to the 100-year standard in order for us to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. The Corps of Engineers did not respond to my inquiries about what would happen if the New Orleans system lost its certification. In fairness, the corps is busy with what it calls a “flood fight that is historic and unprecedented” on the Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers. But the likely scenario is that many people here would lose their discounted federal flood insurance rates, making coverage more expensive, in some cases prohibitively so. Meanwhile, Congress has struggled to pass even short-term extensions to the troubled flood insurance program itself, making a worst-case scenario more possible: Louisianans trapped in homes that they cannot insure, cannot sell and cannot safely live in. It’s a reminder that a warming world has many hazards. A surging wall of water might announce the climate apocalypse in your town, but rising seas also can cause insurance premiums to skyrocket or property values to collapse. Your mortgage can go underwater even while your house remains dry. The plan is to do the bare minimum. The corps is studying how to strengthen the levees just enough to keep the system certified, at an estimated cost of $820 million. But even if the funding is forthcoming, piecemeal fixes like that are what got us to this point, and they won’t get us much further. The crisis looming in New Orleans already reflects what one reporter here described as a “devil’s bargain” that Louisiana made after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. After the storm, the one thing that nearly everybody in the state agreed on was that New Orleans needed strong levees. Louisianans lobbied the George W. Bush administration for projects that could protect the region from a Category 5 hurricane, which the Corps of Engineers estimated to be a 400-year event. But the White House balked at the cost. Instead, the Bush administration supported only the 100-year protection necessary for the city to qualify for the flood insurance program, and it offered, as both carrot and stick, to let New Orleans remain eligible for coverage as the corps rebuilt the broken levees. Louisiana was forced to accept flood insurance at the expense of meaningful flood protection. The recent announcement suggests that we could end up with neither. Louisiana’s levee system stands, for now, as a sinking monument to America’s dangerously shortsighted climate policies. The corps acknowledged as much from the start. While it had called its pre-Katrina levees a “hurricane protection system,” it described the post-Katrina project as only a “risk reduction system.” A 2011 corps report estimated that if a storm surge overtopped the levees, it could kill nearly a thousand people. The Association of State Floodplain Managers recommends a 500-year standard as a minimum for urban areas. In a better world, the systemic response to the climate crisis that New Orleans needs, like the one backed by proponents of the Green New Deal, would not seem revolutionary. New Orleans needs substantial investments to survive in a warming world. It’s not just hurricanes we have to worry about, either, with streets that flood when it rains, and the Mississippi River so high. Just as important as levees, though, New Orleanians need substantial investments in jobs, education and health care in order to thrive. All Americans do. We need to rebuild the country’s public works so that they offer robust protection for all of us. The same goes for our public programs and institutions, because good infrastructure makes life possible, but it does not make life worth living. Louisiana’s levees stand, too, as an emblem of our dangerously precarious social contract. Engineering alone cannot resolve the problems the climate crisis poses. Among the hundreds of pages of technical evaluations in a 2009 internal corps’ review of the New Orleans levee system, the one that was inadequate on arrival, there are a few arresting sentences that diagnose a more fundamental problem. “We too often optimize based on immediate cost and accept short-term gains instead of long-term solutions,” the review team observed. “This is a national cultural malady that can only be reversed if the public demands a change in policy.” One day soon, when the streets flood, as they do with ominous regularity here, the water will not recede. But by then, the banks and the insurance companies and the people with the means to do so will have already left. There are no more short-term gains to be had.

2019,"When the Mueller Investigation Ended, the Battle Over Its Conclusions Began","WASHINGTON — When Attorney General William P. Barr summarized the special counsel’s conclusions in a March letter, prompting President Trump to crow that he had been exonerated, the special counsel’s prosecutors knew immediately what the public would learn weeks later: The letter was a sparse and occasionally misleading representation of their exhaustive findings. What followed was a dayslong, behind-the-scenes tussle over the first public presentation of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history. A richer picture of that battle emerged on Wednesday — one of testy letters (Mr. Barr described one as “snitty”) and at least one tense phone call between the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and Mr. Barr. The two were longtime friends who found themselves on opposite sides of an embattled president. The growing evidence of a split between them also brought fresh scrutiny on Mr. Barr, who on at least three occasions in recent weeks has seemed to try to outmaneuver Mr. Mueller. First, he released his four-page letter on March 24 outlining investigators’ findings; then he held an unusual news conference on the day the Mueller report was released; and on Tuesday night, the Justice Department put out a statement that significantly played down the concerns among Mr. Mueller’s team. In other words, Mr. Barr, who said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday that “we have to stop using the criminal justice system as a political weapon,” now stands accused of doing exactly that. The drama began around midday on March 22, when a security officer working for Mr. Mueller arrived at the fifth floor of the Justice Department to deliver copies of his highly anticipated report to the attorney general and his top aides. Mr. Barr worked through that weekend reading the report, his aides in occasional contact with members of Mr. Mueller’s team. Two days later, hours before Mr. Barr’s letter was sent to Congress, Mr. Mueller’s investigators reminded Justice Department officials about executive summaries they had written to be condensed, easily digestible versions of their 448-page report. But Mr. Barr used almost none of the actual language from the Mueller report, and his letter made the report appear far less damning for the president than it turned out to be. In one instance, Mr. Barr took Mr. Mueller’s words out of context to suggest that the president had no motive to obstruct justice. In another, he used a fragment of a sentence in the report about the Trump campaign and Russians that made a conclusion seem less damaging for Mr. Trump’s advisers. By the next morning, Mr. Trump had spent hours claiming he had been exonerated by a report the world had not yet seen. “No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!” he wrote in a tweet early on March 25 — actually a retweet of himself from the day before. In the middle of this presidential bluster, Mr. Mueller wrote Mr. Barr a letter expressing his and his team’s concerns that the attorney general had inadequately portrayed their conclusions. Pointedly, he attached the report’s executive summaries as a reminder that his investigators had already done the work of distilling their findings. It is unclear what Mr. Barr did in response to the letter — its full contents have not been made public — but two days later, another dispatch from Mr. Mueller arrived. It was written in careful, lawyerly language, but the anger and frustration among the special counsel’s team was clear. [Read one of Mr. Mueller’s letters.] Mr. Mueller said that the attorney general’s public presentation of the report’s findings from days earlier had sown “public confusion about critical aspects of our investigation.” “This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the department appointed the special counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations,” Mr. Mueller wrote. Mr. Barr indicated on Wednesday that the letter had annoyed him, calling it “a bit snitty” and “probably written by one of his staff people.” But after receiving Mr. Mueller’s second letter, he picked up the phone and delivered a message to the special counsel: Stop the letters. “I said, ‘Bob, what is with the letter?’” Mr. Barr told lawmakers on Wednesday. “Why don’t you just pick up the phone and call me if there’s an issue?” Mr. Barr said that he asked Mr. Mueller whether anything was inaccurate in how he had described the report’s conclusions. “He was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report,” Mr. Barr said, adding that Mr. Mueller said he was bothered by how the news media had portrayed his conclusions about whether the president had obstructed justice. Mr. Mueller’s March 27 letter makes no mention of news reports. During the call, according to Mr. Barr, the special counsel pressed again for Mr. Barr to immediately make public the executive summaries to provide a more accurate picture of the conclusions of the Mueller report. Mr. Barr said he was disinclined to put out the report in “piecemeal” fashion. In the weeks that followed, Mr. Barr repeatedly and publicly made veiled criticisms of Mr. Mueller and his team. Asked during congressional testimony in early April whether the Mueller investigation had been a “witch hunt,” he demurred. On April 18, hours before the report’s release, he gave a news conference during which he said he disagreed with Mr. Mueller’s legal reasoning on the obstruction of justice issue. He also went out of his way to explain how Mr. Trump’s behavior — when put in context — was understandable. At this point, weeks after Mr. Mueller delivered his report, all the public had seen of his work was what Mr. Barr had summarized in his four-page letter. On Wednesday, Mr. Barr was clearly peeved, even defiant, at the criticism that his actions had played a distorting role in molding the narrative of the Mueller report in a way that benefited his boss. He called the controversy “mind-bendingly bizarre” because he always intended to release a fuller version of the report. For his part, Mr. Mueller has made no public statements since the conclusion of his work. It is not yet known when, or even if, he will testify before Congress. OpinionJames Comey",The New York Times
2019,When the Names on Campus Buildings Evoke a Racist Past,"College campuses have long been centers of social foment and student activism. In the 1960s, they were magnets for protests over the Vietnam War, and more recently, the Black Lives Matter movement forced schools to confront issues of racial justice and inclusion. The debate continues at many universities over whether the names of prominent racists and others who espoused contentious theories should be allowed to remain on campus buildings and structures. In response, institutions have begun to set up task forces to examine their histories and set standards for the future. Each university takes a different approach. The name of an Oscar-nominated actress was recently removed from a theater because of her role in a movie that romanticized the Ku Klux Klan. Elsewhere, faculty members confronted university regents over charged accusations of academic dishonesty. Here is how four universities handled a push to rename campus buildings. Last month, the University of Minnesota board of regents held a special meeting to discuss whether to remove the names of four former university administrators at the school’s Twin Cities campus. A faculty-led task force had recommended they do so, saying the men had promoted racist policies. The most prominent of the administrators was Lotus D. Coffman, the school’s president from 1920 to 1938. The task force said he excluded black students from university housing, medical training programs and athletics. Members of the task force spent several months studying the issue and, along with the university’s current president, Eric W. Kaler, supported removing the names. But shortly after the report’s February release, one of the regents, Michael D. Hsu, a management consultant, accused the task force of academic dishonesty, saying it left out information that would have vindicated Mr. Coffman. In an interview, Mr. Hsu said he found letters written by Mr. Coffman that countered the task force’s research. He presented the information to his fellow regents. Some agreed with him. “My feeling and concern was this was not a good job,” he said. Members of the task force were not impressed with his sleuthing. “We’ve been called amateur historians by people who have Ph.D.s,” he said. Some people saw his comments as a war on scholarship. “Michael went to a dark place,” said Abdul Omari, who, until his term recently ended, was on the board of regents with Mr. Hsu. “In my opinion, he attacked the faculty.” At the meeting last month, the regents shifted in their seats as a group of 50 protesters taunted them. A woman in the crowd demanded that faculty members be allowed to speak. “This is a farce,” one student yelled. One of the men at the regents’ table called for officers to remove the protesters. More insults were lobbed. “Hard things have been said,” Mr. Kaler told the crowd. “People’s reputations have been attacked.” What the university needed, the president said, was closure. (Mr. Kaler declined to be interviewed.) Closure came. The board voted 10 to 1 against removing the names. Mr. Omari said he was the lone holdout. “I never thought the board would vote to take the names down because they came from a politically charged standpoint,” he said. “People talked a lot about context. But I don’t know a context where racism is ever O.K.” On May 3, Bowling Green State University in Ohio announced it would remove the name of the actress Lillian Gish from a campus theater after students complained about her starring role in D.W. Griffith’s “The Birth of a Nation,” a 1915 film once hailed as a masterpiece. Now the movie is widely criticized for its racist portrayal of African-Americans during and after the Civil War. Three months before Bowling Green’s announcement, members of the Black Student Union had approached university officials to ask that her name be removed because of her association with the film. The Gish Film Theater was named in 1976 for Ms. Gish, a celebrated film actress from the silent era, and her sister, Dorothy. Both women were born in Ohio; neither attended the university. Rodney K. Rogers, Bowling Green’s president, said in an interview that he had known little about “The Birth of a Nation” and had approved a task force to review the actress’s life and work. It released a report after members read her memoirs, listened to public remarks and spoke with her former agent, Mr. Rogers said. He recalled that Ms. Gish made a speech in 1983 saying that actors should take responsibility for their work. At the same time, he said, “the task force found no evidence that she tried to distance herself from the film.” The university’s trustees voted unanimously to remove her name. “We have gotten letters and emails saying we did not get this right,” Mr. Rogers said. “My response is, ‘I hope you read the report.’” “The past isn’t always rosy,” Michael Quick, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs of the University of Southern California, said in a recent interview. “If we can’t figure it out as a university, how do we figure it out as a country?” In February, Dr. Quick announced a task force that would establish principles and procedures for the removal of historical names from campus buildings and structures. The task force was prompted, in part, after students demanded last year that the name of Rufus B. von KleinSmid, a prominent figure in U.S.C. history, be stricken from one of the main buildings on the school’s Los Angeles campus. Mr. Von KleinSmid served for 26 years as the fifth president of the university, turning a sleepy smattering of colleges in 1921 into a Southern California powerhouse. He was also a prominent member of a leading eugenics organization, the Human Betterment Foundation, that promoted forced sterilization to improve human genetics. Dr. Quick said the task force would address issues of university history beyond Mr. von KleinSmid. “This is a much larger conversation about how people deal with the past and context,” he said. The task force plans to begin in the fall. “As long as people bring open minds to addressing this,” he said, “we will work this out.” In May 2015, the board of trustees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill voted to strip the name of William Saunders, a North Carolina legislator and Confederate soldier, from a building and rename it Carolina Hall. Student protests against Mr. Saunders began as early as 2001, with activists highlighting the fact that Mr. Saunders, a U.N.C. alumnus, held a leadership role in the Ku Klux Klan. In 2015, as Black Lives Matter gained prominence as a national movement, trustees were impelled to act. Students held protests and demanded that Saunders Hall be renamed Hurston Hall in honor of the celebrated author Zora Neale Hurston, who is said to have attended classes at the university. The vote to rename the hall was not unanimous. But after a review, the trustees conceded that university leaders in 1920 made a mistake in citing Mr. Saunders’s role as head of the K.K.K. in North Carolina as a qualification. Unlike at other universities, the trustees at Chapel Hill enacted a 16-year moratorium on further name changes. U.N.C. students continue to protest polarizing figures, though. Last year they toppled a statue of “Silent Sam,” a Confederate monument. Cecelia Moore, a historian and project manager of the task force on Chapel Hill’s history, said the moratorium was agreed to because it “would take years to develop methods” to best explain the university’s history. She said her task force was charged with providing information, not implementing policy. “We need to give the university time to better tell the history and contextualize events,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,"When, if Ever, Is It Unethical to Visit a Country?","Seven well-traveled writers discuss the dilemma of whether or not to visit nations with oppressive governments. What should one consider when choosing where to travel? Every destination offers its own appealing reasons for visiting — from its food to its people, from its cities to its historical sites — and there are always the more practical concerns that weigh down any traveler (costs, visas, seasons, flight routes, internet access). But the 21st-century traveler is more knowledgeable than ever before — she must engage in the ethics of where she visits, and why. Global conflicts are not new, but in a shrunken world, we hear of them much more quickly and in much more detail than we would have a generation ago. This means that even the casual traveler also faces an ethical dilemma when she chooses where to visit. What about a country’s treatment of minorities? What about its freedom of speech or the transparency of its government? And if we do go to a country ruled by a despot or military junta, will our currency benefit the nation’s citizens or only the regime that oppresses them? While there are few widely agreed upon rules for answering these questions, asking them seems increasingly vital. Here, seven travel writers contemplate the ethical ambiguities of travel. Taseer’s most recent book is “The Twice-Born: Life and Death on the Ganges” (2018). He lives in New York City and traveled to Morocco for T’s spring Travel issue. The other day, driving from Islamabad to Lahore, my driver — a man in his 30s from southern Punjab — asked me if I was married. “No,” I lied easily, as I would automatically have done in half a dozen societies from Indonesia to Morocco. “Should I have been braver,” I asked my sister, “and said, ‘Yes, I am married to a lovely white man from Tennessee, a little taller than yourself?’” “No,” my sister said resolutely. That would not only have been stupid but dangerous. The question of whether it is ethical to go to a country that persecutes people based on their gender, sexuality, religion or ethnicity is one that I have always answered unethically, which is to say, without an underlying principle that can be applied universally. The truth is that until I moved to New York four years ago, I had never lived with the idea of a unified moral landscape. In the societies where I had lived, the morality was set at many different speeds — what the German political scientist Ernst Bloch calls “the simultaneity of the non-simultaneous,” i.e., the coexistence in the same place of modern, early modern and premodern moral codes and ways of life — and one was obliged to switch between moralities as if between languages. It was never an option, till I moved to America, for me to be the same person everywhere. What I ate (pork in Pakistan, beef in India), whom I slept with, what substances I consumed and, in my case, whom I married, was privileged information. I would no more tell a driver in Pakistan that I was married to a man than I would tell him I liked bacon with my eggs. Did these moral silos produce a corresponding moral ambivalence? Not at all. If anything, it made me treasure those places where I could be open. But if travel has taught me anything, it is how little people are the sum of their politics. The wonder of travel, for me, is to reckon with the kindness that can survive in the heart of a religious bigot, or the integrity of someone conforming to a moral system that they believe wholeheartedly but that may be repugnant to us. I do not advocate surrender, but I say: Go everywhere, and watch yourself moving about against a hostile background. We have an obligation to be who we are in full knowledge of what the world is. Saro-Wiwa lives in London and is the author of “Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria” (2012). How do we define what constitutes an oppressive government? My threshold is perhaps lower than other people’s. I see persecution not just in the obvious regimes, such as North Korea, but in countries such as the United States, where ill treatment may not be codified in law but exists nonetheless. My Nigerian friend’s brother died after being hit with a Taser during a struggle with California police, yet I would still vacation there. Perhaps being a minority on several fronts requires you to live in a permanent state of cognitive dissonance. You learn to override your outrage and exist in places where some people have values you abhor. My father was also killed, by the military dictatorship in Nigeria, but the idea of discouraging travel to Nigeria never entered my mind. I want people to see Nigeria. I would prefer a halt to the flow of corrupt international bank transfers over a halt to the flow of people, since the former has more power than the latter. Tourism and the exchange of ideas and exposure to foreigners can challenge and influence local ideological viewpoints over time, especially among the younger generation. Countries that are the least open to tourism often have the worst human rights record. Of course, it is hard to escape the worry that by visiting places with oppressive laws you are validating the regime of the day. But I believe the benefits of travel outweigh that. And it is possible, in your own small way, to help those suffering discrimination, through donations, information exchange, connections. Tourism need not be apolitical — it’s not where you travel but how you do it. I do draw the line at places where the oppression is wholesale, such as apartheid South Africa. Sunning oneself on the beaches of 1980s Cape Town, where blacks were dispossessed and excluded, was unequivocally unethical. However, I will soon be visiting Pakistan — land of persecuted Christians. My hosts in the beautiful Hindu Kush do not represent the anti-Christian values of their government, so I feel comfortable going there. I’m looking forward to supporting businesses and interacting with people who may never have seen a black person before. Hopefully I will leave a positive impression of Africans. Distinguishing between Pakistan and apartheid South Africa may be subjective. But that’s the point: The Golden Gate Bridge may be one person’s symbol of paradise but another person’s vision of hell. Iyer’s most recent book, “Autumn Light,” was published in April and “A Beginner’s Guide to Japan,” his next book, will be released in September. He traveled to Greece for T’s spring Travel issue. The only question to ask before visiting a place is whether the locals at the other end would rather see you or not. For 45 years now, I’ve been traveling mostly to closed or impoverished countries: not just North Korea and Yemen, but Cuba (six times between 1987 and 1994) and Tibet (in the 1980s, 1990s and this century), Myanmar again and again. In every case, I felt that the people I’d be visiting would far prefer to see me and other tourists than not. Yes, the money I spent would be claimed by unforgivably repressive governments; yes, my very presence might be taken to be an endorsement of those tyrannies and might even help them stay in power; yet tourists like myself would be the only source of information, possibility, even solace that many voiceless and oppressed souls might encounter. Without us, they’d be suffering through a kind of solitary confinement. The first principle of travel is that people are not the same as their governments; indeed, even in the free world, they’re often the victims of those governments. Walking down the streets of Havana on the 28th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, I inevitably drew toward me all those who longed to complain about their rulers, to escape them (or, in a few cases, to spy on me on their behalf). What I encountered was the same response that war photographers everywhere report: In times of terrible grief, people want their stories to be taken to the larger world, because otherwise the suffering will go on behind closed doors, possibly forever. “Tell your country what’s going on here,” people say. “And tell us, please, what it’s like everywhere else.” The first time I went to Myanmar (then Burma), in 1985, tourists were scarce and the locals I met could not have seemed more blue-skied and undefended. Even as I chafed against the constraints of a seven-day visa and any number of arbitrary restrictions, their whole lives were spent in such a state. A bar of chocolate, a photo of my homeland, a piece of the larger world was all they craved — and the chance to tell me what they were going through. I wrote about one friend, a humble trishaw driver I encountered, in my first book, “Video Night in Kathmandu,” worried about the consequences for him. Over the next 30 years, I’ve heard from my friend again and again: “Thank you, thank you for coming to visit us in our prison. And thank you for sharing my story with the world. I sometimes think it’s all I have.” Murphy lives in Lismore, Ireland. Her many books have recently been recognized by the Royal Geographical Society, which, in June, will present her with the Ness Award for travelers who have successfully popularized geography and the wider understanding of our world and its environments. Is it a generational thing? In my remote youth, travel was rarely inhibited by ethical considerations. The Iron Curtain of course imposed restraints; otherwise, we applied for visas and roamed lightheartedly. In 1953, when I set off to cycle around Francoist Spain, no one reprimanded me for condoning fascism. Eight years later, my plan to cycle through the shah’s Iran, en route to India, provoked no shocked protests about Savak. Nor did references to tyrannical emperors disturb my three-month trek through Haile Selassie’s Ethiopia. True, those journeys predated mass tourism, which so many contemporary governments are so keen to promote. In 2019, should we think twice before spending time and money in Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s Egypt or Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil or Joko Widodo’s Indonesia? It certainly makes sense to ask, “Who benefits if I don’t go to X, Y or Z?” and then, “Who might benefit if I do go and return with useful facts to be used constructively?” Facts about the denial of women’s rights, the persecution of minority religions or gay communities, the indiscriminate felling of rain forests, the ruthless damming of rivers, the anti-peasant collusions between “developing world” governments and corporate agribusinesses. We are now in that uncomfortable terrain between travel and tourism. Plainly, holidaymakers can’t be expected to probe their host countries’ defects — quite often linked to their home countries’ hypocritical “foreign aid” programs. Undoubtedly, the tourists’ tacit (or unknowing) support for unjust regimes may fortify them. But how can we measure the value of our holiday spending to the tourism-dependent citizens of X, Y or Z? Moreover — and no less important — friendly, outgoing foreign visitors can do a lot for international relations at a grass-roots level. Where to draw the line? Or should any line be drawn? (Space constraints require me to ignore the elephant in this room; one day very soon a thick line must be drawn under budget-flight mass tourism.) When the Chinese government opened Tibet to foreigners, everyone expected me to rush to Lhasa. But I didn’t want to go. My time working with Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal had drawn me close to their culture, and it would have deeply distressed me to see its vestiges superficially “restored” as tourist bait. However, my motive for eschewing this ravaged country was personal and emotional, not a matter of principle. Should I be ashamed to admit that ethical scruples have never curbed my wanderlust? Or can we agree that this newish debate is best left to the individual’s conscience? Yuan was the inaugural 52 Places Traveler, in 2018, for The New York Times. She is a freelance writer based in New York City. While on the 52 Places To Go trip, I visited multiple destinations recovering from war, violence and humanitarian crises: Rwanda, Cambodia, Germany, Lithuania, Canada, Australia, China, great swaths of South America and many of my 11 stops in the United States. If you’re interested in history and traveling the world, it’s rare to go anywhere that wasn’t the site of horrific violence at some point, either toward animals or fellow humans. My home state of New Mexico, which I love very much, is one of those places. We travel to explore empathy, and it’s important not to avoid places with troubling pasts, but to listen, bear witness, remember and go home and tell others what we’ve learned. At the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda, I saw people curled into balls and sleeping on the lawn, seemingly overcome with emotional exhaustion. The genocide came up in casual conversation; it’s embedded into everyday life, even 25 years later, as the country is experiencing a strong recovery. Whether to visit a country that is currently persecuting people is a different ethical choice. I didn’t have to face it while on the 52 Places trip, but it did come up right afterward, when I was recuperating in Southeast Asia and one of my travel companions was heading to Myanmar. I didn’t go because I didn’t have time, because it wasn’t safe for me to go as a journalist and because it didn’t feel right to spend a vacation in a country where its armed forces and Rakhine Buddhists have been have been killing the Rohingya Muslim people and gang raping Rohingya Muslim women and girls. My friend didn’t encounter any signs of oppression while there; just kind motorcycle taxi drivers of Myanmar who were grateful for the tiny financial infusion he brought to their lives. We talked about the ethical implications before he left, and he decided that he’d rather see the country to better understand it in the small window of time he had, since he didn’t know when, if ever, he’d be back to that part of the world. And he was glad he went. It’s a tricky dilemma for Americans, when our own country is persecuting asylum seekers and separating children from their parents at our southern border, or when certain states have passed laws criminalizing people with uteruses who don’t carry pregnancies to term. Should we start boycotting parts of our own country? Would it be wrong for visitors from other countries to do the same? I don’t know what the right choice is, or whether I might make a different choice about Myanmar under different circumstances. It just wasn’t the right choice for me in that moment. Mehta is author of “This Land Is Our Land: An Immigrant’s Manifesto,” out this June from Farrar, Straus and Giroux. He is based in New York City. All nations are imperfect, but some are more imperfect than others. Should you boycott Myanmar because of its treatment of the Rohingya, or Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians? How about Slovakia for its treatment of the Roma, or the United States for its treatment of African-Americans? Which glass house do you live in, and where would you like to direct your stones? I lived and taught in Abu Dhabi for a semester, not because I am in sympathy with the regime there, but because I am a reporter, and I wanted to see firsthand how the 88 percent of the nation’s population who are migrants are treated there. And I’ve written about their situation in my new book. There’s a difference between a reporter going into a country with a troubled human rights record to write about the situation there and a tourist going to prop up a dictatorial regime with their hard currency. But there’s a little bit of a reporter in every tourist. You might not like the policies of the Venezuelan junta, but you might want to witness firsthand the situation on the ground, unfiltered by media reports of whatever political orientation. If you go to a country with an oppressive regime, you are morally obligated to step out from your five-star hotel, if you should choose to stay there, and speak to ordinary people, and carry the news back home to your friends and family — who might then call their representative or write a letter to an editor. You can’t just be there for the food and the sights because otherwise you really are funding tyranny. But if you mix in a little bit of reporting with the sightseeing, you can be, in your own way, an agent of change. Kulish has reported from more than 40 countries on five continents for The New York Times, as the Berlin bureau chief, an East Africa correspondent based in Nairobi and now as a member of the paper’s investigative team. He is the author of the novel “Last One In” and co-author of the history book “The Eternal Nazi.” He is based in New York City. I confess I am largely numb to the question of when it is ethical to travel somewhere. As a foreign correspondent for The Times, you internalize the dictum “something bad happened; go there.” Terrorist attack? Civil war? Invasion? Catch the next flight. Revolt, protest, natural disaster? Get as close as you can and report back. So stumbling out of covering an insurgency in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, I didn’t ask myself whether I should be subsidizing President Paul Kagame’s orderly but repressive regime in Rwanda. I just wanted to see a silverback mountain gorilla double-bass-drum his chest before they went extinct. Should we have gone to Uganda, where the infamous Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2014 was about to pass, or back into war-torn eastern Congo? Those are the only three places you can visit these rare animals. I was reluctant to pay entry at the Hezbollah Museum in southern Lebanon, but more out of fear of running afoul of American laws prohibiting material support for terrorism than any deep ethical examination I undertook. A friend paid the entry for our group. Once I had watched their videos, looked at the mannequins posed like life-size action figures in an underground bunker and spoken to the staff at the largely empty museum, a better understanding of their motivations, of their narrative, dawned on me. And while I can’t say whether arguing with the Hezbollah tour guide about the deaths of innocents had any effect on his views, it was better than not trying, wasn’t it? None of us are pure until we’ve ditched the conflict minerals in our phones, ensured none of our vast array of Chinese products were made with forced labor and siphoned the Saudi petroleum from our gas tanks. Everyone has to set the priorities for their personal sanction regimes, whether that means dutifully checking Human Rights Watch and Freedom House each time before visiting Orbitz or just refusing to stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel until the Sultan of Brunei changes his tune on gay rights. My wife and I decided not to include Myanmar on a trip to Southeast Asia. Sunset selfies with burning villages in the background went too far. But the Cambodian and Vietnamese governments benefiting from our visits to Angkor Wat and Halong Bay could not be described as wholly innocent either. Irresponsible travel is possible anywhere. I lived in Berlin during the heyday of dating app pics at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, inspiring Grindr Remembers and later Yolocaust. Because of what I do, I have to believe in transparency, the exchange of ideas, the good that I can do by bearing witness, engaging and writing about it. But maybe I’ve just developed a blind spot, or more like a beautiful filter, to smooth away the flaws in the trips I’m already taking.",The New York Times

2019,Where Are the Statues of L.G.B.T.Q. Pioneers? Here Are 11 Worthy New Yorkers,"Virtually nonexistent among the city’s monuments, L.G.B.T.Q. men and women have made outsize contributions to New York’s identity. It is long past time they were put on a pedestal. Bayard Rustin, 1969.CreditCreditA. Camerano/Associated Press For all of June, New York City will serve as host to World Pride, the biggest celebration of gay liberation in the world. The event marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising in Greenwich Village and the half-century of activism and civil rights reform that followed. In conjunction, we asked readers to tell us which New Yorkers they would like to see paid tribute in the city’s public spaces. We sought suggestions of people who have already died, because the city tends to honor the living differently. This is why you won’t see names like Larry Kramer, the pre-eminent AIDS activist and playwright, on the resulting list. But what of the dead? “Where is James Baldwin?” you might find yourself screaming into your smartphone. “Where is Walt Whitman?” We tried to veer away from the exceedingly famous in favor of keeping the focus on names that have been lost to history or at least those not already so familiar. (Baldwin, Whitman and Gertrude Stein have also already been memorialized by the city in various ways.) It should go without saying that this list is not meant to be definitive. People will argue about it. That’s good. We welcome the debate. Readers responding to our callout overwhelmingly named Marsha P. Johnson as someone to immortalize. Born in New Jersey in 1945, Marsha P. Johnson moved to Greenwich Village after high-school and an adolescence spent ostracized for dressing up in ways that boys usually didn’t. Despite the fact that she was destitute and homeless for much of her adult life — charged with prostitution more than 100 times — she devoted herself to nurturing young outcasts who came to the lower West Side of Manhattan in the 1960s and ’70s for a chance at living authentically only to find out how often sexual freedom tangled with poverty and violence. [Read about Marsha P. Johnson in our Overlooked obituaries series.] Johnson was a “drag mother,” an iconic performer, a model for Andy Warhol. But more than anything, she is remembered now for leading a revolution from the margins, spearheading the rebellion at Stonewall as a transgender African-American woman. In June of 1969, patrons at the bar, a hub of gay life in Greenwich Village, were long exhausted by the antagonisms they faced so routinely from the police. One night they fought back and changed history. Johnson was present for the riot and then dedicated the rest of her all-too-brief life to fighting for the rights of families made in the streets. At the time of Sylvia Rivera’s death from liver disease 17 years ago, The Village Voice called her the Rosa Parks of the transgender movement. Rivera’s work was closely linked with Johnson’s at a time when the term “transgender” had not yet entered the vernacular. One year after Stonewall, Rivera fought to get a gay rights bill going in New York City. Trying to break into a meeting at City Hall about the proposed legislation, she scaled a wall in a dress and heels and wound up in jail. Sylvia was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican father and a Venezuelan mother. After her mother committed suicide, Sylvia was left to a life on her own, in Times Square, by the time she was 11. She identified with the Black Panthers and the Young Lords, a radical Puerto Rican social justice group. Her singular role in the movement to broaden rights for those who did not experience gender or sexuality in a traditional sense was to recognize early on that it needed to be inclusive, that the most vulnerable were clearly those oppressed on multiple fronts — men and women of color whose sexual orientation was nonconforming and who lived on the fringes. Rivera was fighting for legitimacy not just in a straight world but among white, mainstream gay activists who wanted to control the journey and keep people like her far away from the steering wheel. A moneyed son of Boston and a graduate of Harvard, Lincoln Kirstein moved to New York as a young man in 1930 and made an indelible mark on American culture. He was a critic, a poet, an essayist, a novelist and an editor who lived freely with his wife and the various boyfriends that stayed in the couple’s townhouse. During college, Kirstein spent his summers cultivating his love of classical dance. Once, traveling in Italy, he wandered into the funeral of Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes in Venice. The moment was transformative. Kirstein later met George Balanchine and brought him to work in the United States. Together, they founded the School of American Ballet, where Kirstein served as president; the two later founded the New York City Ballet. Although he left his biggest imprint in dance, he was enormously influential in the world of visual art as well, a key figure in the early years of the Museum of Modern Art and a major force in directing its collections. Kirstein had served in the army in World War II, and he returned to Europe as part of a mission to retrieve looted Nazi art. He introduced Mexican avant-garde art to an American audience, supported the early career of Walker Evans and was central to a creative scene that included Evans, Cecil Beaton, Katherine Anne Porter and Jean Cocteau, among many others. Bayard Rustin, best known for organizing the 1963 March on Washington, was also an important mentor to Martin Luther King Jr., bringing Gandhi’s nonviolent methods of protest to the American civil rights movement. When Rustin arrived in Montgomery, Ala., in the mid-1950s to work on bus boycotts, King had not yet embraced these methods; he had armed guards at the door of his house and guns inside. Rustin showed leaders a different way, having gone to India to study pacifism in 1948. Rustin, who lived in Chelsea, has been called the “lost prophet’’ of the civil rights movement in large part because his sexuality forced him to the periphery. In 1953, he was arrested in California on “lewd conduct’’ charges, supposedly for engaging in sex with two white men in a car. This meant that the file the F.B.I. maintained on him — Rustin had been a young Communist — was expanding. Rustin said he knew then that sex for him had to be sublimated. He was regularly the target of homophobic attacks, and other black leaders, afraid of the tensions that would erupt around him, kept him from occupying central roles. Finally, in the 1970s, he could vocally advocate for gay rights. In 2009, when Edie Windsor’s wife, Thea Spyer, died, she was left with a tax bill of $363,053. Fixtures in New York, the couple had married two years earlier in Canada, where it was legal, but the Internal Revenue Service was indifferent to the fact that they had spent a lifetime together. The agency denied Windsor the spousal exemption from federal estate taxes that it afforded heterosexual married couples. Windsor sued the government. She won. In its decision in United States v. Windsor (2013), the Supreme Court held that denying same-sex couples equal federal benefits was unconstitutional. Same-sex marriage prohibitions were then overturned in 17 states, and in 2015 same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide, thanks in large part to Windsor’s efforts. A mathematician who worked as a computer programmer for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and later for I.B.M., Windsor, always a bon vivant, was a late-in-life activist. She died two years ago at 88, leaving behind a second wife, Judith Kasen-Windsor, who was 30 years younger than she was. Billy Strayhorn, one of the most gifted jazz composers of all time, cultivated anonymity in a way that would strike aspiring influencers of the current age as a sign of profound mental instability. Beginning in the late 1930s, he partnered with Duke Ellington to create some of the most important jazz music ever recorded. He wrote “Take the A Train,’’ a standard that became one of the signature pieces performed by Ellington’s orchestra. One of 10 children and a prodigy, he wrote “Lush Life,’’ a haunting chronicle of exhaustion with night life in the face of a doomed affair, when he was just a teenager. Strayhorn deferred to Ellington to such an extent that he once allowed him to take partial credit for a song — “Something to Live For” — that he had written before they even met. After Strayhorn died of cancer in 1967 at the age of 51, Ellington recorded an album that critics would later cite as one of his best works, a collection of Strayhorn’s compositions titled, “And His Mother Called Him Bill.” David Wojnarowicz first made his impression in the New York art world in the late 1970s when he placed stenciled images of burning houses on the sides of buildings in the East Village. An abused child who would later work the piers on the West Side of Manhattan as a hustler, his art addressed same-sex desire, the AIDS crisis (he would die of AIDS in 1992 when he was 37) and the animosity directed at the marginalized in Ronald Reagan’s America. During the mid- to late 1980s he made paintings, collages, mixed media works and films. One of his films, “Fire in My Belly,’’ shot in Super 8, featured insects swarming around a corpse and a plastic Jesus, ignited the wrath of conservatives leaders like Donald Wildmon, then the director of the American Family Association, who went after Wojnarowicz and the National Endowment for the Arts for funding him, in a campaign that only enhanced the artist’s celebrity. Last year Wojnarowicz received a long-awaited retrospective at the Whitney Museum. Born in New York to West Indian immigrant parents, Lorde described herself as a “black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,” but she worked as a librarian as well — and as an essayist, novelist, memoirist and influential feminist thinker. Both her poetry and prose focused on civil rights, discrimination, and the complexities of racial and sexual identity. “From a Land Where Other People Live,’’ her 1973 poetry collection, was nominated for a National Book Award and chronicled the loneliness and rage she felt as a black woman. She was among the most prominent voices of black lesbian life in the country. In 1991, Gov. Mario Cuomo named her New York State’s poet laureate, citing an imagination “charged by a sharp sense of racial injustice and cruelty, of sexual prejudice.” Her work is most resonant today for its deep understanding of the ways that gender, class and race work together to define human experience. Long before Stonewall, there was Frank Kameny, a brilliant scientist who enrolled at Queens College when he was 15 and later earned a doctorate in astronomy from Harvard. In July of 1957, he got a job at the U.S. Army Map Service. Soon after, an investigator from the Civil Service Commission confronted him about rumors pertaining to his personal life. Was he a homosexual? Kameny was fired and within a year he was barred from working for the federal government. Kameny appealed his dismissal, and though he did not succeed in regaining his job, his was one of the first civil rights cases related to sexual orientation to proceed in United States courts. He went on to publicly advocate that homosexuality was not a product of mental illness — the default position in the years before Stonewall — and that there was no justifiable reason for subjecting gay men and women to the many forms of bias society kept unleashing. In 1898, Sara Josephine Baker graduated second in her class from the New York Infirmary Medical College. She had planned a life conventional for a woman at the turn of the century, but when her father died, she needed to help her family stay afloat. She set up a medical practice on the Upper West Side but failed to make any money. In need of an income, she went to work for the city’s health department and ultimately became one of the most significant figures in the history of American public health. Preventive medicine barely existed before Baker came to see it as so essential, in the early 1900s. She sent nurses to new mothers living in the city’s tenements and had those nurses instruct them in how to care for infants. Infant mortality rates significantly decreased, and by 1923 every state in the country had a bureau of child health like the one Baker pioneered in New York. Baker’s later life was spent with her partner, Ida Alexa Ross Wylie, a novelist and screenwriter who was always clear about how much more she preferred the company of women to men. Few artists are as readily identified with New York in the 1980s as Keith Haring, whose graffiti art took the form of distinctive chalk drawings in subway stations, where blank advertising backboard was easy to find. Soon came commissions for large works of public art around the world. There was a hunger for his exuberant, childlike style, his use of color during a time of plague and despair. Haring’s art was both consumerist and socially conscious — it raised awareness (about AIDS, drug use) as it brought joy. Haring learned he was infected with H.I.V. in 1988 and died two years later at the age of 31, having had his work already featured in more than 100 group and solo exhibitions.",The New York Times
2019,Where Did the Right Whales Go?,"Trilobites New evidence suggests that the endangered population lost much of a critical food source, but may be stabilizing slightly as it shifts territory to feed elsewhere. Something happened to the population of North Atlantic right whales in the last decade, as their numbers shrank and fewer calves were born. Scientists had long speculated that a change had occurred in the whales’ sources of food. By 2017, only 411 animals were counted, down from 482 in 2010. A paper published this month in the journal Oceanography, links warming in the Gulf of Maine with the life cycle of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a tiny shrimplike creature that forms the foundation of the right whale diet. Although it is hard to prove cause and effect, the paper’s lead author, Nicholas Record, said the study connected “the big ocean-scale climate changes” in the North Atlantic with the water coming into the Gulf of Maine and the whale’s food resources. “All of these pieces lined up together really well,” said Dr. Record, senior research scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, a nonprofit institute in Boothbay, Maine. “It was really kind of stunning.” An influx of warm water near the ocean floor in 2010 significantly reduced the abundance of the shrimplike creature in the Gulf of Maine that summer and fall. Warmer water would have brought in fewer Calanus and also meant that more died and were eaten earlier in the season, Dr. Record said, leaving less food, “right when right whales need their last big meal before winter.” The whales followed the Calanus populations elsewhere, including to Cape Cod Bay and to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in northern Canada. Their shift in location may have created even bigger problems for the overall population, when they might have been hungry and moved to places with heavy shipping traffic. North Atlantic right whales live off the East Coast of the United States and Canada, heading north during warmer weather and south during the winter. Many summer off New England and points north; their calving grounds are off the coast of Florida and Georgia. “We’ve planned all these conservation measures around areas where we have known the whales to show up at the same time each time of year,” Dr. Record said. “When they stop showing up in those areas, and start showing up where protected measures aren’t in place, that’s when the problem starts.” In 2017, 17 right whales died, including 12 in Canada, mainly as a result of being struck by ships or caught in fishing lines; three more stranded in 2018. Eighty-five percent of right whales have been entangled in fishing lines, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Shipping lanes and fishing locales are designed around traditional feeding grounds for the whales. But as those shifted, the whales came into more contact with boats and nets. And perhaps because the whales were undernourished, only five new calves appeared in 2017 and none in 2018, according to NOAA data. This year, seven calves have been sighted, which scientists hope signals that the whales have found new feeding waters and are sufficiently healthy to begin rebounding. The shift in habitat has caused problems for lobstering in Cape Cod Bay, where the whales have been spending more time. Since December, whale researchers counted 267 right whales in Cape Cod Bay — roughly 60 percent of the known population­, said Charles Mayo, a co-author on the new paper and the director of the Right Whale Ecology Program at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass. While the concentration has been a great boon for whale watchers, it has put tremendous strain on the local lobster industry, and boaters are limited to speeds of 10 knots (about 12 miles per hour) within the bay. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Massachusetts recently extended the closing of Cape Cod Bay to lobstering, but protests had forced the state to rescind the measure. “The most draconian right whale conservation restrictions in place anywhere is right here in Massachusetts,” Beth Casoni, executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen’s Association, said at a rally on May 9. “It’s frustrating to the fleet” in Cape Cod Bay, which number about 100, she added by email, “as there are thousands of fishermen fishing to the north.” Canada, which had not seen a lot of right whales north of the Bay of Fundy, had experienced an uptick, too, in recent years. If whales are going to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to search for food, they are swimming as much as 700 to 800 additional miles, which means they will need to eat more to stay fully nourished, said Sean Hayes, protected species branch chief with NOAA in Woods Hole, Mass., who was not involved in the new study. Right whale sightings were uncommon in the Gulf of St. Lawrence before 2017, said Catherine Brennan, of the Ocean and Ecosystem Sciences Division of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. But about 130 individuals were identified in the gulf last year. Although they congregate in the southern part of the gulf, they have been crossing major shipping lanes, which puts them at risk, according to Catherine Johnson, a biological oceanographer who was a co-author on the paper. Canada has imposed lower boat speed limits, restricted some fishing around shipping lanes and fishing areas, and added aerial and acoustic surveillance to try to better understand where the whales are congregating, said Hilary Moors-Murphy, research scientist for the Maritimes Region whale research program at Fisheries and Oceans Canada. With just about one-third to half of all of the whales seen in Canada in recent years, researchers are unsure where the others are. Dr. Mayo’s staff flies daily over Cape Cod Bay, and crosses it in boats, scouring for whale activity. Now that some right whales are diving deeper to feed off a species called Pseudocalanus, they’re harder to spot, Dr. Mayo said. To combat entanglement in fishing lines, NOAA has been working with the fishing industry and inventors to experiment with lobster pots that are not connected by rope to buoys at the surface, Dr. Hayes said. Sound can also put whales under additional stress, he noted. When shipping off the East Coast was temporarily halted after Sept. 11, and the ocean quieted, whale stress levels dropped precipitously, according to a 2012 study led by researchers from the New England Aquarium. The right whales in the southern Atlantic have fared much better than their northern counterparts, enjoying a habitat where it is calmer and there is less contact with fishermen’s ropes or ship traffic, according to NOAA research. “Those animals have been recovering since the end of commercial whaling to the point that they’re giving birth to more calves every year than we have North Atlantic right whales,” Dr. Hayes said, adding that almost no adults have been known to die in those populations for at least 70 years. “It shows you what the potential of the population is.”",The New York Times
2019,Where Is President Duterte? A Weeklong Absence Fuels Speculation and Scrutiny,"MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines is not known to shy away from the spotlight. His bombastic speeches and public appearances regularly make headlines in his home country and further afield. So when the 74-year-old leader went several days without appearing in public, it quickly ignited speculation that he could be seriously ill. This week, news outlets pondered whether he was hospitalized, while citizens exchanged their own theories on social media. A former aide of Mr. Duterte’s moved to dispel those rumors on Sunday, six days after the leader was last seen, releasing a series of photos showing Mr. Duterte sitting alongside him at a table at Bahay Pangarap, the president’s official residence in Manila. Several daily newspapers were laid out on the table in front of them, and in one image, Mr. Duterte points to the paper’s headline, suggesting that the photo was taken the same day the photo was sent to local news outlets. But another day then elapsed without his return to the public eye, and Monday marked a week since Mr. Duterte was last seen. According to local news outlets, the last sighting of him was when he cast a ballot in the national election on May 13. He appeared upbeat and walked without assistance, and briefly addressed reporters in southern Davao City. Salvador Panelo, the president’s spokesman, told reporters on Monday that he had spoken with Mr. Duterte by phone and that the president was at his official residence “signing papers.” “I talked to him yesterday,” he said. “His voice was very strong.” Mr. Panelo added that Duterte laughed off the rumors that he was in the hospital. “In other words, to him, it’s not a serious matter,” the spokesman said. “Because if it was serious, he always tells the public about it.” Mr. Panelo said Mr. Duterte has been in Manila since Friday, and has spent the last two days with his family. Mr. Panelo said that when he asked the president about the rumors of a hospital visit, Mr. Duterte told him: “I neither confirm nor deny. You draw your own conclusions.” Reports of poor health have followed Mr. Duterte for some time. He acknowledged in October that he made a secret visit to the hospital earlier that year for an endoscopy and colonoscopy. The tests, according to the presidential palace, were routine as the leader has Barrett’s esophagus — a condition where cells grow abnormally in the esophagus and can sometimes develop into cancer. Mr. Duterte is known to see doctors at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center in Manila, and some news outlets speculated that he was being treated there most recently after patients were quoted by local radio as saying the security there had been unusually tight over the weekend. A change in Mr. Duterte’s complexion, which has noticeably darkened, has also fueled speculation of illness, though Mr. Duterte dismissed it as sunburn and the natural discoloration of aging. According to Rappler, a local news outlet that has been monitoring Mr. Duterte’s public appearances, he has been suddenly absent from the public eye without an explanation, at least four other times. There were rumors this month that Mr. Duterte was ill when he took several days off after an official visit to China, disappearing from April 29 until May 4. Twice in June 2017 he went unseen for several days, and once in February of that year.",The New York Times
2019,Where Michael Bennet Stands on the Issues,"Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, the 21st Democrat to declare his candidacy for president, is known as a moderate who seeks bipartisan compromise. Here’s where he stands on a few key issues. Mr. Bennet may be best known for being part of the so-called Gang of Eight: four Democratic and four Republican senators who negotiated a comprehensive immigration proposal in 2013. The bill, which passed the Senate but not the House, included: • A path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who passed a background check, paid a fine and back taxes, and learned English. • An expanded visa program for agricultural workers and an expedited path to permanent residency for student visa holders who earned advanced STEM degrees. • A 700-mile border fence, new border-monitoring technologies and about 20,000 more Border Patrol agents. • A stronger system for companies to verify employees’ immigration status. More recently, Mr. Bennet was co-author of a proposal that would have prevented the government shutdown in December by giving President Trump $25 billion for a border wall in exchange for protections for immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children. Mr. Bennet, a former superintendent of the Denver school system, has focused heavily on education policy in the Senate. “I think we need an education president,” he told The Des Moines Register this year. “There’s no public good that’s more important than education.” In 2015, he helped write legislation that overhauled the No Child Left Behind Act, transferring some authority from the federal government to the states and reducing the use of standardized tests to evaluate students and teachers. He has supported expanding Pell Grants and is a co-sponsor of the Finish Act, which would provide funding for colleges and universities to “increase access to higher education for high-need students, increase degree attainment and improve efficiency in our higher education systems.” In materials provided to The New York Times, his campaign did not make any concrete education proposals but said Mr. Bennet would work to ensure that “college students can pursue their studies without incurring the crushing burden of debt; more people seeking an alternative to college can pursue high-quality apprenticeships and job training; and Americans throughout their lives can advance their careers by improving their existing job skills or learning new ones.” Mr. Bennet is in line with the rest of the Democratic field in calling for recommitting to the Paris Agreement and preserving Obama-era climate regulations that Mr. Trump is reversing. He has also supported regulating methane emissions and creating a standardized metric for the federal government to measure the cost of greenhouse gas emissions. In March, he helped create the Senate Special Committee on the Climate Crisis, and last month, he was co-sponsor of a bipartisan bill that would provide tax incentives for energy storage. In other areas, though, he has diverged from the party’s left wing. In a USA Today op-ed essay in 2017, he said some Democrats had played into Republicans’ portrait of them as “job killers fundamentally out of touch with most Americans.” “It is not enough to call for less coal or oil without having meaningful work to replace lost jobs,” he wrote, and “when Democrats oppose natural gas, we fail to appreciate both its importance to small-town economies and its pivotal role in reducing coal production.” He also suggested that instead of opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, Democrats should have negotiated a deal that approved the pipeline in exchange for emission reduction measures. Mr. Bennet is a co-sponsor of the American Family Act, a Senate proposal that would give every family with children a refundable tax credit of $250 to $300 per month. He also supports expanding the earned-income tax credit. And his campaign outlined the broad strokes of an economic platform involving infrastructure improvements, high-speed broadband in rural areas, and investments in “advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, superconductors and quantum computing.” On health care, he and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia recently introduced a bill that would create a public option called Medicare-X; Mr. Bennet said that he wanted “universal coverage” but that his model was “more practical” than the single-payer ones many other Democrats have come to support. He has specifically criticized “Medicare for all” proposals that would eliminate private insurance. “What Democrats are saying is, ‘If you like your insurance, we’re going to take it away from you’ — from 180 million people that get their insurance from their employer and like it, or 20 million Americans who are on Medicare Advantage and love it,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in February. “That seems like a bad opening offer for me.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Where Modi’s Victory Isn’t What It Seems,"In this far corner of India, insouciant party-hopping is the rule. Mr. Friese is a magazine editor in India. NEW DELHI — With Narendra Modi re-elected as India’s prime minister with an intimidating majority, the fact that his Bharatiya Janata Party also triumphed in the far-flung northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, by the border with China, may seem incidental, like a foregone conclusion. It’s not. And while liberals and secularists throughout India despair that Hindu nationalism and fear-mongering have prevailed again, the B.J.P.’s victory in this distant corner of the country doesn’t mean what it seems. Arunachal Pradesh’s name translates, officially, as the “land of the dawn-lit mountains.” Ever since the country took its present shape in 1947, the first light of each Indian day has fallen on an Arunachali mountain hamlet called Dong. This is the kind of sentimental factoid that appeals to bureaucrats in New Delhi, where the sun rises a good hour and 20 minutes later. And that’s probably why the six-week process of India’s 17th general elections, which concluded this week, began in a quixotic paramilitary outpost of Arunachal Pradesh: at the Animal Training School of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force, where a company of horsemen from across the country cast the very first ballots. Although the state has only two seats out of 543 in the national Parliament’s lower house, the Lok Sabha, elections here are a reliable source of journalistic tchotchkes: the arrival of an electronic voting machine, in the snow, at the “highest polling station” in Luguthang village or the somewhat overcooked tale of intrepid election officials braving jungles and trekking “six kilometers over uneven terrain” to set up a polling booth for a single desultory voter. It’s difficult not to exoticize Arunachali politics. Ten years, or two elections, ago, I was in the small mountain-town of Hawai (not too far from Dong), walking up the serpentine driveway of Kalikho Pul, a member of the state’s Legislative Assembly. The cemented driveway was long and steep, and every 20 feet, on either side, stood a wooden pole topped with the blackened skull of a massive “mithun,” or bison (bos frontalis). I must have passed dozens of skulls before I got to the house on the hill. My meeting with Mr. Pul was uneventful, but the macabre approach to his home said a lot about the colorfully odd marriage of convenience between the tribal cultures of this mountainous frontier and the political economy of the Indian republic. As totems of wealth and power, Mr. Pul’s installation had all the showiness of a typical Indian politician. But the skulls were also an intimidating assertion of local identity. Public displays of bovine sacrifice would be unthinkable — even life-threatening — in much of this country: Mobs of Hindus known as “cow vigilantes” have murdered Muslims in recent years, accusing them of slaughtering sacred cattle. Yet here Mr. Pul’s trophies represented respect for old gods and old ways of sharing the fat of the land. Arunachal Pradesh’s exceptionalism reflects this archaic plenitude, an almost unsettling natural abundance of land and water and forests. The state has the lowest population density of any in India: 17 people per square kilometer compared with some 1,100 per square kilometer for Bihar, the country’s densest state. And a majority of its 1.4 million inhabitants are recorded as members of “scheduled tribes” who enjoy certain inalienable and exclusive privileges. Indian citizens who are not native tribals cannot own land in Arunachal Pradesh or be elected to the local legislature — except to the one seat out of 60 that is kept “unreserved.” Arunachal Pradesh is also a “Special Category State,” and as such receives major financial grants and subsidies from the central government. That largess has intermittently fueled the highest economic growth rates in the country: The gross state domestic product grew at 16.5 percent in 2015-6. This despite an overwhelmingly rural economy where distinctly pre-capitalist practices, such as nomadic slash-and-burn agriculture, are still widespread. Not to mention ceremonial mithun sacrifice. But Arunachal Pradesh has been cosseted by the Indian government mostly for an entirely modern reason: fear of China. The People’s Liberation Army briefly occupied the area during a humiliating border war in 1962, and China still maintains a threatening claim to what it likes to call “Southern Tibet.” The Indian government’s fear is probably compounded by some guilt since it took the Chinese threat for the Indian state to really make its administrative presence felt here. It wasn’t until 1977 — when the rest of the country was voting in the sixth national elections — that Arunachalis first got to choose their own representatives, for both the state and national parliaments. They have been making up for that late start: Arunachal Pradesh’s electoral politics are flamboyant even by India’s carnivalesque standards. During the last, five-year, electoral term, the state has had seven administrations. The former governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa, who oversaw much of this political churn, earned his own place in local ignominy by describing a mithun sacrifice at the gates of his residence as “cow slaughter” and evidence of a “breakdown of law and order,” bringing about the dismissal of a first chief minister, Nabam Tuki. With that, though, Mr. Rajkhowa turned out to only be clearing the way to the state’s top post for Mr. Pul — the politician whose mithun-festooned driveway I had visited in 2009. But the farce ended in tragedy after Mr. Pul (then with the People's Party of Arunachal) was removed from office by the Supreme Court, which reinstated Mr. Tuki (of the Congress). Apparently bankrupt and facing eviction, Mr. Pul hanged himself in his official residence in August 2016, leaving a 60-page suicide note titled “My Thoughts.” The current chief minister, Pema Khandu, has been in power since July 2016 and in that time has belonged to three different parties. He “migrated,” as journalists in Arunachal Pradesh put it, from the Congress to the People’s Party of Arunachal to the B.J.P., his current home. Forty-one of the 42 representatives elected on the Congress party’s ticket in 2014 also eventually defected to the B.J.P. — after a stop first at the P.P.A. “Party hardly matters!” my Arunachali friends explain cheerfully. For a North Indian like me, accustomed to the blood feud between the Congress and the B.J.P., and the polemics of secularism versus Hindu supremacy, the Arunachali politician’s ability to change allegiance so lightly and so frequently seems both disconcerting and comforting. On a brief visit to the state in April, during election season, I encountered the customary atmosphere of party-hopping and pelf. There were entertaining scandals ranging from a widely circulated sex tape allegedly featuring Tapir Gao, the B.J.P.’s local party president, to a raid that uncovered 18 million rupees (almost $260,000) in cash from a vehicle in Chief Minister Khandu’s entourage. But the tale of the moment, for me, was about the three Gamlin siblings. (A fourth, Jarbom, who had briefly been a Congress chief minister, passed away in 2014.) Until recently, the Gamlin sister, Jarjum, served the Congress party as its state general secretary, while her brother Jarpum was the B.J.P.’s state general secretary. Their brother Jarkar was minister of tourism in Mr. Khandu’s (B.J.P.) government. But after being disappointed by their respective parties’ allocation of constituencies for the elections this year, Jarjum decided to run for the Lok Sabha with the Janata Dal (Secular) party, a local rival but national ally of the Congress, and Jarpum, for a State Assembly seat with the National People’s Party, a local rival but national ally of the B.J.P. Jarkar was selected as an N.P.P. candidate but soon retired from the fray. No one other than me seemed to find this remarkable, an insouciance that brought to mind the philosopher Slavoj Zizek: “The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally.” I wondered whether the combination of irony, humor and sentimentality that colors Arunachali politics was cynically post-ideological or tribally pre-ideological. Or both. As the outcome of the election neared, the local political drama intensified and darkened. On Monday, some 500 masked men intercepted a team of election officials in Kurung Kumey district and absconded with their electronic voting machines. The officials had come to oversee a make-up election: A previous effort had been derailed when a hanging bridge was “deliberately snapped by miscreants,” according to one regional news outlet, stranding the election officer. On Tuesday, two days before results were announced, the State Assembly representative Tirong Aboh and 10 other people were killed in an ambush by, it is believed, local insurgents. In the end, the B.J.P. secured both of Arunachal Pradesh’s seats in the Lok Sabha as well as, provisional results suggest, a comfortable majority in the State Assembly. Both Jarpum and Jarjum lost their races. Kiren Rijiju, a sitting member of Parliament, has held on to his seat. The minister of state for home affairs in Mr. Modi’s cabinet, Mr. Rijiju is perhaps best known for telling off a colleague who said beefeaters should go to Pakistan: “I eat beef. I’m from Arunachal. Can somebody stop me?” Not exactly standard talk for a B.J.P. man. Then again, he used to be with Congress. Party, as they say, hardly matters.

2019,Where North and South Korea Meet: On TV,"Feature A popular show gives “defector beauties” a chance to tell stories from the North. It’s loud and gaudy — and changing the conversation about reunification. CreditCreditJeongMee Yoon for The New York Times Episode 376 of “Now on My Way to Meet You” aired in late February, three days after the second summit meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Labeled a “special feature,” it began on the streets of Hanoi, a rare on-location shoot. One of the show’s two hosts, the genial comedian Nam Hee-seok, stood behind a police barricade with 30-year-old Shin Eun-ha, perhaps the most well known of the South Korean variety show’s recurring personalities, waiting for the arrival of Kim in an armored limousine. They were surrounded by reporters and gawkers holding up cellphone cameras to the North Korean entourage. When Kim’s limo appeared, Shin loudly, tearfully called out a plea: “Sir, please help me get back home! Please help me get back home!” Shin is no acolyte of Kim or his Workers’ Party. She is a talbukja — a defector to South Korea from the North — and what she longs for is to see her hometown again and to be able to occasionally cross the Demilitarized Zone. This vision of a comparatively open border and some freedom of travel is increasingly what is meant on the Korean Peninsula by “reunification.” There has been talk of normalized relations and corporate exchange, and Seoul has even floated the notion of a European Union-style confederation. Literal reunification, defined as the abrupt political merger of the two Koreas, has mostly passed into a prelapsarian dream of peace activists. When it had its premiere in 2011, “Now on My Way to Meet You” was a tear-jerking reunion program featuring families separated by the Korean War, but before the show had a chance to reunite anyone, it underwent a transformation. The way the producers tell it, in their scramble to recruit separated families, they kept running into a new generation of defectors. So they made the rather canny decision to reorient their show around appealing young women, whom they took to calling “defector beauties.” The show’s on-location backdrops of humble homes and noodle restaurants gave way to a glitzy game-show-type set, and estranged septuagenarians were replaced with girlish defectors. Pretty soon, the only thing left of the original program was its name and the desire for reunion. A typical 90-minute episode might veer wildly from a report on rice shortages to a joke about face cream. The aesthetic is loud and frenetic, featuring sound effects and cartoon thought bubbles. At center stage sit a dozen guests, many of them women in short, colorful dresses, their legs all canted in the same direction. The two hosts engage the group in rapid-fire patter, while an all-male panel of B-list celebrities called the South 4 tosses out oohs, aahs and sexual innuendo. Since its reinvention, “Now on My Way” has attracted a loyal audience, and in the process has become a mass-market vehicle for notions of reunification and North Korean identity, as understood by South Koreans. The show was the first to approach North Korea not as news or documentary but through comedic skits and tearful testimonies by young talbukja. The marriage of silly themes and personal stories produced an aptly incoherent vision of the North: depending on the segment, a hell that must be escaped at all costs or a place of neighborly warmth. In media coverage, “Now on My Way” has been portrayed as a gaudy curiosity, but it’s better understood as a lowbrow show with good intentions. Reunification is a constant sub- and supertext, endorsed by everyone on set. Episode 376 took this theme to a new level. A second segment from Hanoi was filmed in a makeshift studio, a hotel ballroom, with Nam, Shin and several others — talbukja, journalists and a postdoctoral student in nuclear physics, each introduced with an animated title card — seated in a talk-show half-moon. Shin, wearing a demure yellow dress, offered a personal reflection: “As soon as I heard that the talks had fallen apart, it hit me: It’s over. When will we be able to hope for reunification again?” Jun Cheol-woo, a middle-aged defector with a theatrical manner, chimed in. “Seeing Kim Jong-un, I suddenly felt a rush of hope,” he said. “But now that talks have collapsed” — cue close-up, soft piano music and here’s-what-to-think subtitle (“Imagine how Cheol-woo feels!”) — “I thought, maybe I was wrong to hope.” Twelve minutes later, the Hanoi footage wrapped, and “Now on My Way” was back where it usually is, on its elaborate studio set in Seoul. The pretaped remainder of the episode made no mention of diplomacy. One of the South 4 had been swapped out this week for Hooni Kim, the Korean-American chef behind Hanjan and Danji, upscale Korean restaurants in Manhattan. Kim discussed his love of North Korean naengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles) and taste-tested a seafood stew cooked by one of the defectors. We may season things differently, the unsubtle message seemed to be, but we are one. I went to see “Now on My Way to Meet You” in person on a humid summer morning. It airs on Channel A, a cable network started in 2011 by the conservative Dong A Ilbo newspaper, which has its studios in Digital Media City, a cluster of shiny high-rises on what was once a giant landfill. I’d been emailing with the show’s executive producer, Kong Hyosoon, for more than six months, and not without hiccups. She was immensely protective of “Now on My Way” and its cast of defectors. The terrifying back and forth between Trump and Kim Jong-un throughout 2017 — followed, confusingly, by the scheduling of a first-ever summit meeting between the countries’ leaders — had put talbukja on edge. The North Korean government was clamping down on the flow of remittances that many defectors send home via Chinese middlemen. Kong worried that I would interrogate the talbukja and write off the show as drivel. On set, though, the mood was relaxed, and Kong let down her guard. The defectors, the hosts and the South 4 milled around, cracking jokes and catching up like old friends. Many defectors had told me how much they miss the intimacy of their neighborhoods in the North, a stark contrast to Seoul’s cool, atomistic consumerism; but here, a tenderness prevailed. The set was a cartoony village beneath a starry sky: cottages and townhouses, planter boxes, a cobblestone path. Most striking was an old-fashioned telephone booth (calling to mind the fact that the Koreas had just re-established a diplomatic hotline) and a bus stop indicating transit between Pyongyang and Seoul. The props seemed designed to map an imminent reunification. The theme of this episode was North Korean pop culture. The hosts, Nam and the actress Park Eun-hye, asked the younger defectors on set about North Korean millennials’ growing obsession with South Korean fashion, slang and music. This, a South 4 member explained, represented the third wave of defection. First was the kotjebi era of migrants fleeing the famine; second was the jangmadang era of protocapitalists seeking opportunity; and now came the gangnam era of young people “crossing the river to go South,” in search of fulfillment and cool. Everyone onstage nodded. [Read about the black markets in North Korea.] Defections were relatively rare until the late 1990s: a few high-level desertions of diplomatic posts and the occasional cinematic escape from a prison camp. But the widespread famine of the 1990s drove hundreds, then thousands of North Koreans to risk their lives by crossing the Tumen or Yalu Rivers into China and hoping to find passage to the South. The term used for that first wave, kotjebi, translates literally as “flower swallow,” after the scavenging motions of homeless children in the North. South Korea is the logical destination for refugees from the North — not only for cultural reasons but also because it provides them with citizenship and generous benefits. Upon arrival, talbukja are subjected to lengthy interrogation to make sure they aren’t North Korean spies or Chinese-Koreans (ethnic Koreans living in China aren’t given the same benefits) and are then placed in a three-month adjustment program run by the Ministry of Unification, a 50-year-old agency that handles everything from inter-Korean development initiatives to cross-border family reunions. Defectors learn how to take the subway, shop for groceries, use smartphones and master the “Seoul accent.” Once they graduate, the government gives them cash benefits and a housing subsidy, vocational training and scholarships but also places them under surveillance. More than 32,000 talbukja now live in South Korea — up from just over 1,000 in 2001. (Some 400 have appeared on “Now on My Way.”) Female talbukja, having come up in a society untouched by feminism, are viewed by South Koreans as meek and old-fashioned. “Now on My Way” has been criticized for peddling this stereotype, but in the episode I saw being taped, the emphasis was more on romance — what Kong calls “interpersonal reunification.” Following a “Lady and the Tramp”-style skit set in a Pyongyang restaurant (think spaghetti and flirtation at a small dinner table), two new defectors emerged from backstage. One was a 20-something woman who teetered in white platform heels; the other, a stylish, brooding young man with floppy hair. Kong whispered, “He’s a huge YouTube star.” Before and after the taping, in a greenroom marked “VIP,” Kong supervised my interviews with the two hosts; with the head writer, Jang Hee-jung; and with the defectors Shin Eun-ha and Kim Ara, the show’s most popular and glamorous regulars. Kong warned me several times not to ask about politics. “Now on My Way” had been accused, especially early on, of demonizing the North. In a recurring segment called “Defection Story,” talbukja gave unverifiable accounts of the conditions they left behind. In articles, blogs and online forums, other defectors called the program “shameless” and “80 percent lies.” The criticisms were small and large — it wasn’t true that toothbrushes were rare in the North; it was irresponsible to say that 90 percent of defectors had been sexually trafficked. One defector I met in Seoul blasted the show for presenting an outdated view of North Korea, all abuse and starvation. “It makes it harder to achieve reunification with all the inaccuracies on the show and because it reflects an earlier reality,” he said. Shin and Kim joined the program in Season 1 and have continued to appear, week after week. In some episodes, they say very little — the more time passed, the less direct knowledge they had of North Korea. But the women are always game to clap and laugh and cry, offering their alabaster faces for reaction shots. Shin defected with her entire family in 2000; her mother and sister have appeared alongside her on the program. Kim, on the other hand, has been separated from her father since 2008, when she left the North, and has a bit more of a crusading air. “Reliving my trauma is worth it, because I can spread a message to people from different governments and others watching the show,” she told me. Outside “Now on My Way,” Kim is a model and an actress and recently played a Chinese-Korean maid in a soap opera. Her celebrity, she said, was a platform for human rights that she used to endorse diplomacy with the North. “I now have real hope to reunite with my family,” she said. “Until last year, I didn’t think it’d happen until after I die. Our show might be partly responsible.” Kong guffawed. “That’s definitely not true!” she said. “Don’t print that.” Despite her reticence about politics, Kong did acknowledge that “the point of our show is to demonstrate the value of reunification.” Jang, the head writer, said, “There’s room for this show until reunification happens.” Last May, in an episode following a summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea, the hosts asked the day’s cast of defector beauties and the South 4 not for policy prescriptions but for feelings and gut reactions. A defector in a scarlet dress spoke of her changed opinion of Kim Jong-un: “Before, I really disliked him, but seeing the way he spoke and acted at the summit, I was impressed by his sincerity.” Yoo Jae-hwan, a stocky pop singer on the South 4 panel, spoke next, over footage of the two Korean leaders smiling at each other along the Demilitarized Zone. “I got teary, watching them hold hands,” he said. “Even now, thinking about it again, I feel like I’m going to cry.” An animated balloon reading “almost cried” popped up, to the sound of a cartoony pow. Though “Now on My Way to Meet You” was birthed by a right-wing media company that opposes dialogue with the North, its focus on emotion over politics has translated into a vague endorsement of peace. Seoul’s policy toward Pyongyang has vacillated: hard line and militaristic under conservative presidents and conciliatory under liberals. The current South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, is a liberal with an additional, personal stake in North Korean rapprochement — his parents came south as refugees at the height of the Korean War; his mother’s sister still lives in the North. Before becoming president, Moon was a democracy activist, a civil rights attorney and the chief of staff to the left-wing president Roh Moo-hyun. After talking Trump down from threats of war in 2017, Moon used last year’s Winter Olympics to draw North Korea into the global arena and met with Kim soon thereafter. In April 2018, in their Panmunjom Declaration, named after the truce village along the Demilitarized Zone, Kim and Moon pledged to bring an official end to the Korean War, create “a new era of national reconciliation, peace and prosperity” and re-establish cross-border “railways and roads.” The idea of a railway, however theoretical, captured the imagination of South Koreans, who aren’t permitted to visit the North. In February 2018, “Now on My Way” dedicated an episode to the past and future idea of a transcontinental train. Shin held up an enlarged copy of an old-timey passenger ticket. It belonged to Sohn Kee-chung, the Korean marathon runner who won a gold medal for colonial Japan in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Sohn had traveled by train from Japan to Germany, via Korea, China and Russia. “Right now, South Korea is an island,” Shin said. “But it wasn’t always that way. It’s because the peninsula was divided. If we were reunited, we could take the train all the way to Europe.” Moon talks a lot about unity and peace but avoids “human rights,” a phrase that, from the North Korean perspective, smacks of imperial overreach rather than reasonable condemnation of totalitarian control. Seoul has adopted a “spillover” approach, hoping that an emphasis on diplomacy, aid and economic development, paralleling the American focus on denuclearization, will eventually improve the status of human rights in North Korea. Moon is also careful not to put too fine a point on “reunification,” lest he imply a German model of takeover. His Ministry of Unification highlights what it calls the Three Nos: “no desire for the North’s collapse, no pursuit of unification by absorption and no pursuit of unification through artificial means.” For this, Human Rights Watch and defector groups have condemned him for whitewashing abuses. “Now on My Way” has generally fallen in line with Moon’s principles, though some of its defector beauties now support regime change in the North. “I think it’s great that people from our show are advocating human rights and talking about their experiences in North Korea,” Kong said, “but that shouldn’t be seen as being done under the color of our program.” Most South Koreans believe that reunification is necessary, but just 19 percent want it to happen “quickly.” Younger adults are much more likely than those over 50 to support a gradual, deferred reconciliation. Krys Lee, a novelist and professor in Seoul, told me that TV programs like “Now on My Way” are helpful in getting students to identify emotionally with reunification. “I can see the difference since ‘Now on My Way’ went on the air,” said the defector Kwon Seol-kyung, a musician who leads the all-North Korean Pyongyang Art Troupe. “There’s an openness and good feelings about reunification.” “Now on My Way” has given rise to numerous copycat shows, including a nearly identical program called “Moranbong Club,” named after a North Korean girl group, and “Love Reunification! Southern Man, Northern Woman,” both seasons of which had a South Korean man playact marriage with a dainty, naïve talbukja. “In South Korea today, there’s isn’t a TV program that doesn’t deal with the North,” Kong said. Last fall, during yet another inter-Korean summit meeting, the journalist Jin Cheon-gyu held a news conference in Seoul to announce the start of the “Reunification TV” channel, to go live in 2019, befitting a “new path of dialogue between South and North.” It would feature history, culture, food, lifestyle, education, arts, sports and music programs, along with soap operas and films — “but nothing political.” To endorse reunification, though, is ultimately a political act. I had seen, in watching “Now on My Way to Meet You,” how the idea of reunion could be made to feel inevitable, willed into existence, even on an otherwise silly show. “We’re trying to make the audience more curious,” Kong said. “First it was: ‘Wow, we have this many defectors in South Korea? Is that how they live?’ Then, in time, people gained more knowledge about North Korea and the lives of defectors. Now the question is, ‘What happens after reunification?’ ”",The New York Times
2019,Where Steve Bullock Stands on the Issues,"Steve Bullock, the latest Democrat to enter the presidential race, was twice elected governor of deep-red Montana. In 2016, in fact, more than 20 percent of Trump voters also voted to re-elect him. But while Mr. Bullock has promoted centrist policies in some areas, as would be expected from a Democrat in a conservative state, he leans left on other issues. Here’s a look at where he stands. Mr. Bullock’s signature issue is money in politics, especially the deluge unleashed by the Citizens United ruling in 2010: hundreds of millions of dollars from corporations and wealthy individuals who don’t have to be publicly identified. His premise is that this “dark money” has poisoned the political system, and the public’s faith in the system’s integrity, such that the government can’t address other problems without addressing this one first. In 2015, he worked with Republicans in the Montana Legislature to require political action committees to identify their donors. And last July, he sued the Trump administration in an effort to preserve a similar requirement for political nonprofits like the National Rifle Association and Planned Parenthood. [Announcing his bid, Mr. Bullock said defeating a corrupt system was “the fight of my career.”] Infrastructure has been another focus for Mr. Bullock, who is calling for nearly $300 million in spending on Montana’s roads, bridges, sewage and water lines, and other systems. He has also emphasized the need for high-speed internet access in rural areas to close “the rural-urban divide.” Last year, in another major action on internet access, he became the first governor to sign an executive order to restore net neutrality rules at the state level after the Federal Communications Commission repealed it nationally. Other governors followed his lead. Mr. Bullock used to oppose gun control. As recently as 2016, he rejected universal background checks and emphasized that during his tenure, “our Second Amendment rights have been expanded in Montana.” More recently, however, he has shifted. In an op-ed in The Great Falls Tribune last year, he wrote that he had come to support universal background checks, magazine size limits and extreme risk protection laws. (Commonly known as red-flag laws, these measures allow the temporary removal of firearms from people who are deemed likely to become violent.) Over the summer, he went further, endorsing a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, which he had rejected in 2009. Most of the Democrats running for president are calling for universal health care, but Mr. Bullock isn’t. Asked last year whether he supported Medicare for all, he demurred, saying there were “any number of different paths” to make health care “affordable, accessible and of quality.” He did shepherd an expansion of Medicaid through the Republican-controlled Montana Legislature in 2015. He also supports the Affordable Care Act and has spoken out against attempts to repeal or undermine it, accusing the Trump administration and congressional Republicans of trying to “sabotage” the law. As governor of Montana, which has been hit hard by droughts and fires exacerbated by climate change, Mr. Bullock has called for swift action on the environment. He condemned Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, writing on Facebook: “Ask any Montana farmer, rancher, hunter, angler or skier — climate change is real and poses a threat to our economy and way of life. To not acknowledge that or deal with it in a responsible way is shortsighted and dangerous.” But his proposals are not necessarily the same as other Democrats’. He has argued that it’s impossible to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the next 15 to 20 years — longer than the time scientists say is left for action — and that states like his own ought to test technologies that would capture carbon emissions. “You often hear a false choice: You can either address climate change or we can continue to produce power from coal and fossil fuels, but not both,” he said in 2017. “And I think we need to reject this choice.” An earlier version of this article contained outdated information about Montana’s Medicaid expansion.

2019,"Where Will Measles Break Out Next? Chicago, Los Angeles or Miami, Scientists Predict","A new study ranks the risks in U.S. counties by the numbers of unvaccinated children and proximity to international airports. But no one predicted the outbreak in Brooklyn. Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami are the cities most likely to see the next measles outbreaks, according to an unusual new study. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and Johns Hopkins University mapped the 25 American counties most at risk of measles because of their vaccine-exemption rates and proximity to airports. A similar map published last year proved surprisingly accurate at forecasting many of this year’s cases. But both groups of scientists failed to predict the measles outbreak that began in Brooklyn, currently the nation’s largest. These prediction models need refining, one expert noted, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should make it a priority in order to get ahead of measles cases. The study, published this week in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that Cook County, which includes Chicago, was likeliest to experience a measles outbreak. Los Angeles and Miami-Dade counties were next, followed by New York’s Queens County and the counties that include the cities of Seattle, Phoenix, Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Houston and Honolulu. To assess risk, the researchers looked at how many children in counties across the country had nonmedical vaccination exemptions — which include “religious,” “philosophical” or “personal belief” exemptions, depending on state law. The team then focused on counties with international airports, because every American outbreak since 2000 has begun with a case imported from overseas. They gave greater weight to airports with many passengers arriving from countries with thousands of measles cases, including India, China, Mexico, Japan, Ukraine, the Philippines and Thailand. However, both studies failed to foresee what is now the country’s largest outbreak — the one among Orthodox Jews in the Williamsburg neighborhood of New York — which is in Brooklyn, not Queens. (The Lancet authors said their forecasts were correct about two-thirds of the time, as long as counties “spatially adjacent” to the ones they saw as potential hot spots were included.) In September last year, the virus spread from Ukraine to Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel. One month later, Orthodox Jews from New York carried measles almost simultaneously to Brooklyn and to suburban Rockland County, N.Y. The outbreak spread from New York to Orthodox communities in Michigan. “What we did not calculate at all was that it would come from Israel,” said Sahotra Sarkar, a professor of philosophy and integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-author of the new study. A similar study published last June in PLOS Medicine ranked the risk of measles outbreaks in 18 states with philosophical or personal belief exemptions to vaccination. The research was prescient: almost half the “hotspot” metropolitan areas the scientists noted — particularly Washington State, Texas and Michigan — saw outbreaks this year. “In the major leagues, that’s an all-star batting average,” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and a co-author of the PLOS Medicine study. Dr. Hotez and his colleagues did not look at New York State because it does not have “philosophical” exemptions to vaccination, although the state permits religious ones — a loophole that the legislature is considering eliminating. “What I never expected was an outbreak in Jewish communities,” Dr. Hotez joked. “In my book, Jews make the vaccines.” (Dr. Hotez, who is Jewish and researches vaccines against tropical diseases, cited such pioneers as Albert Sabin, Jonas Salk, Stanley Plotkin and Rachel Schneerson.) To refine their predictive models, both Dr. Hotez and Dr. Sarkar said they would need to learn to account for the fact that vaccination rates are not evenly spread out across urban counties; low rates tend to cluster in smaller ethnic, religious or educational communities. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In the last five years, according to the C.D.C., 75 percent of measles cases have occurred in tight-knit communities, such as Somalis in Minneapolis, the Amish in Ohio and Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn. This year’s measles outbreak in Washington State’s Clark County, near Portland, Ore., includes 72 cases linked to Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, according to a Vox article citing C.D.C. sources. Many of the immigrants were skeptical of government medical requirements, including vaccination. Near Austin, Tex., Dr. Sarkar said, vaccination rates are lowest among children attending Waldorf schools and a few charter schools where families reject vaccination. Many are influenced, he said, by Andrew Wakefield, the former British doctor who started the misconception that the measles vaccine causes autism, even though that research was discredited long ago. After losing his medical license, Mr. Wakefield moved to Austin, where he directs films condemning vaccination. “He has a very well-heeled following here,” Dr. Sarkar said. The Austin area is number 22 on his list of places most likely to see a measles outbreak.",The New York Times
2019,Where Would You Visit To Find Out More About Your Family’s Past?,"Student Opinion Have you ever traveled to the places where your ancestors were originally from? Have you ever dreamed of doing so? What would you want to see, find or learn from such a trip? What do you already know about your family’s heritage? Do you feel connected to your ancestral roots? Or do you feel distant or cut off from them? In “The Trip I Hope All African-Americans Can Take,” Mercedes Bent writes about a trip she took to West Africa to learn more about her ancestral heritage: At a naming ceremony in the home of my host family in Lagos, Nigeria, I wore brightly colored traditional clothing — a long, rectangular skirt tied tightly around my waist and an off-the-shoulder top with short, flared cuffs, all in a pink ankara pattern with a matching head wrap. “Please stand,” said my host, who had graciously offered to tailor the ceremony — which is normally performed for babies — for me, her adult visitor from the United States. “I hereby give you the name Esosa; it means ‘God’s gift.’ You are now Esosa Oloke. Welcome to the family. You will always have a family here in Nigeria.” I felt a surge of gratitude and belonging. For the first time in my life, I felt deeply connected to the African continent and to the people who live there. The ceremony concluded a 10-day trip to Nigeria and Ghana this year, Ghana’s Year of the Return, that I organized for friends and classmates. To commemorate the 400-year anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to English North America in 1619, President Nana Akufo-Addo has encouraged descendants of Africans who were enslaved in the Americas to return to the country. But my idea for a heritage-focused trip had been in the making for over a decade. The seeds were planted during my freshman year of college. At the first meeting of the Association of Black Harvard Women, several of the people who introduced themselves had names with African origins. I still remember my classmate Adora Izukanane Obianuju explaining that her middle name was chosen as a reminder of her place in the family and the bond her mother hoped she would have with her siblings. Then it was my turn. “Hi, I’m Mercedes Bent. My name … well, it’s kind of like the car.” It’s not that I don’t like my name — I do. I just wished I had a more intimate connection with my heritage. The Opinion essay continues: This year, I finally organized a trip for a group of my black friends and classmates and me to explore our own heritage. On that trip I learned to cook jollof, a rice dish that is a staple of West African diets. I learned about investment opportunities in Nigeria, including cashew farms and start-ups. I had my hair braided. I visited castles where enslaved people were kept in dungeons before they exited through the door of no return. We discussed Nigerian history over dinner and learned about the political turmoil and wealth of the country. One day in Accra, Ghana, we attended Afrochella, a Coachella-inspired festival featuring top African musical artists. Through it all I reflected on what life would be like if I lived in a nation where I was part of the dominant racial group. In Nigeria or Ghana, I would be one drop in the sea of black people at every event I attended and in every social situation. I wouldn’t be subjected to as many off-color remarks and subtly bigoted insults. I wouldn’t have to question whether I should respond to those or stay quiet to avoid being judged through the lens of racist stereotypes. I wouldn’t wonder whether people would think I’d been hired as a token rather than for my potential. The essay concludes: Of course, not everyone can afford such a trip. I would love to see a philanthropist or foundation fund educational trips to Ghana, Nigeria and other African countries for black young adults from other parts of the diaspora, making this experience accessible to more people who could benefit from it as much as I did. Until then I’ll continue spreading the word about the benefits I experienced, the power of exploring my ethnic-racial identity in the place where my ancestors lived and the most important lesson I learned on my journey: It really is possible to heal through heritage. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — Where would you visit to find out more about your family’s past? What would you hope to learn or experience? — How familiar are you with your family’s history? Does living in America ever make you feel disconnected from your family and cultural roots? Do you ever wish, like Ms. Bent, that you had a “more intimate connection” with your heritage? If yes, tell us why. — Ms. Bent writes: There are many ways to nurture a healthy cultural identity, but a journey “home” — to a place that makes you feel that you truly belong — is an especially effective one. Do you agree? What aspects of her essay resonate with you most? Does reading Ms. Bent’s piece make you want to connect more with your own heritage? — Have you ever created a family tree?

2019,Where in the World Is ‘The Daily’?,"THE DAILY NEWSLETTER Telling more stories from around the globe. [Want to get this by email? Here’s the sign-up.] If you scroll through the last few weeks of “The Daily,” a pattern emerges. A revolution in Sudan. A terror attack in Sri Lanka. An election in Israel. We’re going global. Or more global. That was always the plan. We started off focused on the biggest domestic stories of our time, perhaps inevitably. We launched in the opening days of a polarizing new presidency that seemed to produce earthquake-sized news every day, sometimes every hour. We told powerful international stories (this episode, about assisted suicide in Canada, comes to mind), but our overall emphasis felt decidedly stateside. As we enter our third year, we’re deeply invested in telling stories of the wider world, exploring places and personalities we may have overlooked and checking back in on what are now familiar lines of coverage: the state of Brexit, the political crisis in Venezuela, the creeping authoritarianism of China. In the past, we’ve sent producer Andy Mills to Iraq to tell the story of the final days of the Islamic State in Mosul. Annie Brown reported from the U.S.-Mexico border. Just this week, two producers left the U.S. for — well, we won’t say exactly where yet. And producer Lynsea Garrison will spend the next year crisscrossing the world, where she will have no shortage of ideas and partners: The Times has 31 international bureaus and more than 200 journalists reporting from abroad. President Trump will remain a major, ever-present story for us, and domestic reporting of all kinds will be a permanent fixture of our programming. But more and more, we’ll bring you in-depth stories from the rest of the globe. P.S. Speaking of international, we’re holding a live event in London on June 6th. I’ll speak with two of our correspondents — Berlin bureau chief Katrin Bennhold and London-based international correspondent Ellen Barry — about the rise of populism across the globe and the fallout from Brexit. And we’ll be joined by “Daily” producers to talk about how we make the show. More information and tickets are available here. Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb. In Monday’s episode, Adam Liptak outlined three ways in which adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census could work in favor of the Republican agenda. It made us wonder if there were ways that adding the question could backfire for Republicans. Here’s what Adam had to say: “I don’t see any scenarios in which adding a question on citizenship turns out to be bad for Republicans. At the most basic level, as President Trump put it in a tweet, it could help the administration identify unauthorized immigrants. ‘The American people,’ he wrote, ‘deserve to know who is in this Country.’ “More sophisticated rationales also help Republicans. If adding the question drives down participation in states with big immigrant populations, as government experts say it will, those states will lose seats in Congress. And the states with big immigrant populations are mostly blue. “The information generated by the question could also help states draw voting districts that count only eligible voters instead of the current practice of counting everyone. That would move voting power from blue urban centers with many immigrants to red rural areas with few immigrants. “Even the administration’s stated reason for adding the question — to help enforce part of the Voting Rights Act to protect minority voters — tends to help Republicans. Packing minority voters into voting districts in which they can elect the candidates of their choice does almost always lead to the election of Democrats in those districts. But it tends to dilute Democrats’ voting power across all districts.” While making Monday’s episode, producer Annie Brown went down the rabbit hole of Census Bureau promotional videos and became our resident expert: “During our interview, I was struck when Adam Liptak said that the census is the largest peacetime mobilization that the U.S. does. I wanted to find some audio that would convey that sense of communal patriotism. It turns out the Census Bureau produces a promo video every decennial year. The 1930 promo was a silent film, complete with title cards and an orchestral score. The makers of the 1970 promo were clearly impressed by the computer and its futuristic new sounds. But it was the 1980 promo and its multiracial choir in the shape of the fifty states that stole my heart. (Note that as the camera zooms out, you can see Alaska and Hawaii holding their own.) All week I’ve been humming, ‘In 80 million mailboxes ’cross the U.S.A., the census is a’coming …’” Can the Trump administration ask about citizenship on the 2020 census? Adam Liptak explains why this question is at the center of the Supreme Court’s biggest case this session. “I don’t think the N.R.A. is necessarily as invincible as it might have been in the past.” Danny Hakim on how the threat of an investigation plunged the gun rights group into crisis. A 30-year dictatorship has been toppled in Sudan. Declan Walsh reports from Khartoum on what comes next. At a contentious hearing, Attorney General William Barr defended his rollout of the Mueller report. We spoke to Nick Fandos about Barr’s testimony. Secret intelligence documents leaked to reporter Nick Casey suggest that some of President Nicolás Maduro’s people are starting to turn on him in Venezuela.

2019,Where the Family Business Is Selling Books,"Books Territory With its second generation taking ownership this year, Carmichael’s Bookstore in Louisville keeps the past in mind as it heads into the future. LOUISVILLE, Ky. — To outsiders, Kentucky’s largest city may be best known for its active bourbon distilleries, a baseball bat factory, famous fried chicken and a certain horse race run the first Saturday in May, but just ask someone there where to buy a book. “Carmichael’s,” said one longtime resident, “is a Louisville institution.” The year 2019 has already been a big one for Carmichael’s Bookstore. The city’s oldest independent bookseller just celebrated its 41st birthday in April. But in January, Carol Besse and Michael Boggs, the couple who founded the store in 1978, officially passed on ownership to the next generation: their daughter, Miranda Blankenship, and niece, Kelly Estep. Both Blankenship, 37, and Estep, 44, grew up working in the store. Despite having parents as booksellers, Blankenship didn’t jump right into the family business at first, going off to study in criminal justice in college. “I honestly kind of rebelled away in the early days,” she said, but eventually rejoined the staff after realizing she enjoyed helping people find the right book, whether offering suggested reads or tracking down the right title based on a half-remembered description. “Every day here is different. I realized I didn’t want to sit behind a desk all day,” she said. Estep’s mother (Besse’s sister) has been a longtime Carmichael’s employee and Estep herself has been working at the store on and off since she was 14, dusting shelves and learning the fundamentals of the retail business at an early age. “Although we are new owners and we’re still fairly young, we have a lot of experience and that’s a good thing,” said Estep. Established in a city that still makes a lot of its own stuff, Carmichael’s Bookstore — now expanded to two locations and a children’s shop — has a reputation for knowledgeable employees, community involvement and strong support of area authors. “I think the ‘buy local’ movement is thriving here in Louisville and I think it’s growing across the country,” said Blankenship. The older Carmichael’s Bookstore at 1295 Bardstown Road recently had a growth spurt as well. Last fall, the store expanded into the space left by an adjacent Heine Brothers’ coffee shop that moved across the street. Even with the additional square footage, the Bardstown Road store is still packed with a wide selection of new books, magazines, greeting cards and literary-themed gift items like T-shirts, tote bags, buttons and fabric Sylvia Plath and Zora Neale Hurston dolls. The store windows are papered with posters advertising the busy Carmichael’s events calendar, which includes several author appearances and a book club gathering each month — usually held over at the larger store at 2720 Frankfort Avenue. The schedule has also included poetry readings, a watch party for “The Great American Read” series on PBS, a musician’s book-and-album signing at a nearby record store and chats with children’s books illustrators. “People are craving some of that nondigital world and bookstores are providing that, but we also have to make sure we’re modernizing and keeping up with trends,” said Estep. Carmichael’s Bookstore now programs about 250 events a year in its shops and around town. [Want to explore more of the city after you get done book shopping? Check out “36 Hours in Louisville” for some ideas.] For young readers, Carmichael’s Kids (at 1313 Bardstown Road) has a healthy selection of children’s books, toys and gifts. One of the store’s picture windows, furnished with pillows and a large stuffed Clifford the Big Red Dog, serves as a “book nook” for in-house sampling. “We do two ‘story times’ a week,” said Blankenship, who said the company also coordinates author readings and book fairs at schools. Located along streets dotted with restaurants and other small businesses, the Carmichael’s stores have a relaxed, neighborhood feel about them that appeals to the serious book browser out for a morning stroll — or the occasional bus full of tourists spilling out to go shopping. “We’ve always been supported by the community,” said Blankenship. “We were one of the founding members of our local independent business alliance.” Taking over a long-established family enterprise gives the new owners a chance to put their own stamp on the stores, but they say they don’t have major plans to change a lot of things. “We appreciate and what has obviously been a successful way of doing business for 40 years,” Estep said, “and we think about how we can bring that forward with us and our generation.” While the founders have largely retired, they haven’t completely stepped away from the family business, whether it be consulting or something more hands-on. As Blankenship noted, “my dad will pick up shifts if we need coverage.” J.D.

2019,Where the Good Jobs Are,"For people without a college degree, finding work that offers decent pay can be a challenge. The solution may require a change in scenery. You dropped out of college, or decided straight out of high school that college was not your thing. Here’s some advice if you are looking for a job: Stay out of Washington. Don’t go to New York. Forget about San Francisco. If you want to make anything near a decent wage, head for Toledo, Des Moines or Birmingham. Most of the 140 million Americans over 25 who lack a bachelor’s degree face pretty dim job prospects. The median wage for workers with some college education but no four-year degree is $835 per week, about 10 percent less than it was at the turn of the century, after inflation. Workers with a bachelor’s degree typically make one-third more. Underneath the grim average, however, the truth is that there are better-paid jobs available to workers without the requisite college credential. The trick is finding them. They are not always in the most obvious places. Keith Wardrip of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and Kyle Fee and Lisa Nelson of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland have put together a map. Its most resounding and confounding recommendation: Stay out of the superstar cities. Their booming tech, health and financial industries may offer great jobs for the college educated. But if you don’t have the degree, they have little for you. Mr. Wardrip, Mr. Fee and Ms. Nelson define a “good job” in simple terms: It has to pay more than the national median wage, $37,690 in 2017, adjusted for the cost of living in the area. In Springfield, Mo., the cutoff is $33,100. In San Jose, Calif., it is $47,900. To figure out how many of these jobs are open to people without degrees, the researchers scoured nearly 30 million local job ads across 121 metropolitan areas to determine their minimum educational requirements. They called them “opportunity jobs.” Their findings offer a sliver of hope for the future of the American worker. About 22 million jobs — over one in five across the metropolitan areas in the study — pay more than the median wage. They include some surprises. For all the talk that you need a bachelor’s degree these days to become a registered nurse, 66 percent of available registered-nursing jobs did not require one. Many make do with an associate degree. Neither did 46 percent of openings for executive secretaries and executive administrative assistants. Nor did 53 percent of the searches for computer-user support specialists. All the positions cleared the wage floor. Some of these job categories are growing fast. The economy is expected to add nearly half a million jobs for registered nurses between 2016 and 2026. And Mr. Wardrip noted that as the job market had tightened over the last five years, employers had relaxed their educational requirements. The most striking finding is how these jobs are distributed geographically. In Asheville, N.C., more than four in five job openings for computer-user support specialists do not require a bachelor’s degree. In San Francisco, only about a third are open to people without a degree. Fewer than half the nursing jobs in Raleigh, N.C., are open to people who haven’t graduated from a four-year college, compared with 85 percent in Huntsville, Ala. Of course, bigger cities will have more opportunity jobs. They have more jobs over all. But they also have more workers without four-year college degrees competing for work. In St. Louis, there are 2.3 workers without a degree for each opportunity job. In the New York-Newark metropolitan area, there are 4.5. A couple of patterns stand out. For one, prices can explain a lot about the regional distribution of good jobs. You need to earn more in expensive places to stay above the median wage. The metropolitan areas around Austin, Tex., and Cleveland have roughly the same total employment. But living in Cleveland is cheaper. So while only 18.5 percent of Austin’s jobs offer good wages to workers without college degrees, opportunity jobs account for 30 percent of Cleveland’s employment. In the superstar cities, sky-high rents make this very difficult. The cost of living in the New York area is 37 percent higher than in Birmingham, Ala. So while the $34,700 annual wage of a typical bill-and-account collector in Birmingham clears the threshold to be considered a good job by more than $1,000, the $44,380 wage for the equivalent job in the New York area falls about $1,500 short. Hence there are 1,371 opportunity jobs in Birmingham collecting bills and accounts. In the New York area, there are none. The industry mix of various urban areas also plays an important role. For instance, what remains of America’s manufacturing sector is also enhancing job opportunities for those who aren’t college educated. Former industrial hubs like Cleveland and St. Louis still offer some blue-collar jobs that pay a decent wage. How to expand opportunities to workers without a four-year degree? Part of the answer involves training, for sure. Cities might also try to promote the expansion of the kinds of industries that offer most opportunity jobs. But the enormous variation in educational requirements for similar jobs across the United States also suggests that many employers seem to be asking for more education than the job requires. There may be good reasons for hospitals in Raleigh to require registered nurses to have a bachelor’s degree. The positions might involve more complex care requiring a higher level of skill. But the large disparity in educational requirements suggests that many employers are demanding more education than needed just because they can be more selective when they have a larger pool of workers to choose from. An earlier version of this article misstated the share of openings for computer-user support specialists, in a recent study, that did not require a bachelor's degree. It was 53 percent, not 47 percent.",The New York Times
2019,Where the Who’s Who of Horse Racing Celebrate the Belmont Stakes,"It may seem strange that jockeys, trainers and owners all stay under the same roof for a race of such consequence. But during the Belmont Stakes, this is exactly what happens. Last year, Justify, an American thoroughbred racehorse, ridden by jockey Mike Smith, won the Belmont Stakes with a time of 2 minutes and 28.18 seconds, becoming only the 13th winner of the Triple Crown. It seemed like an unbeatable moment for Jack and Laurie Wolf, the co-owners of Justify. But more thrills came later that day. After the race, the couple, who split their time between Louisville, Ky., and Saratoga, N.Y., returned to their hotel. When they got out of their car, they saw that about 25 staff members, dressed in uniforms, had lined up outside the property, many of them holding trays of Champagne. Spectators were clapping. “I had tears in my eyes,” said Ms. Wolf. “It was my favorite memory, just amazing.” The four-star Garden City Hotel is in Long Island, about a 23-mile drive from Midtown Manhattan. Since opening in 1874, the hotel has been a gathering place, cultural center and temporary home for jockeys, horse owners, trainers and journalists attending the Belmont Stakes, the third and final race in the Triple Crown series. And for Mr. and Ms. Wolf, it was a place to celebrate a win. The couple, after their celebrity-like greeting, returned to their suite to change and then headed to the ballrooms on the second floor for a celebration. “We keep spaces available for the winning families,” said J. Grady Colin, a general manager who has worked at the hotel for seven years. Over 80 people, including all four Wolf children and an infant granddaughter, attended the party, some staying awake until 2 a.m. “I honestly can’t remember what we drank,” said Ms. Wolf. “I just remember it being a big party.” At around midnight, Mr. Smith, the winning jockey, was holding court at King Bar, off the lobby, after having bought dinner for the other jockeys at the Red Salt Room. (It is tradition for the winning jockey to buy dinner for the rest — the Belmont purse is $1.5 million.) That celebration also went into the wee hours of the morning. Hotel guests regularly stopped by to pat him on the back and get his autograph. “I think I ordered some sort of steak, but I didn’t come close to finishing it because people would stand up and cheer,” Mr. Smith said. “I would try to take a bite and then they would cheer again or ask for photos.” “Ninety-five percent of the people who came up to me I didn’t know, but no one was a stranger that night,” he added. “I wanted to tell everyone the story of winning the Triple Crown.” It may seem strange that jockeys, trainers and owners all stay under the same roof for a race of such consequence. But during the Belmont Stakes, which this year takes place on June 8, this is exactly what happens. All the behind-the-scenes activities of a major horse race — the hobnobbing between owners and trainers, info trading among serious gamblers and the parties — happen not at the racetrack, but at this historic hotel. Garden City assumed its role as horse race headquarters by happenstance. In 1905, when the Belmont moved from Morris Park Racecourse, in the Bronx, to its current home, Belmont Park, in Elmont, N.Y., it was the only luxury hotel in the region. “It had no peer,” said John Ellis Kordes, a local historian. “Every famous person who came to the area came to this hotel,” Mr. Kordes said. “You had Vanderbilts coming through the front door. Charles Lindbergh stayed here before making his famous flight. If there was a big event, it was logical for them to be at this hotel.” Now, of course, there are other luxury options. “Some other owners have started to stay in the city,” Ms. Wolf said. “For people who don’t live in New York City, it can be more fun for them to do that.” This means that the Garden City management must work hard to keep the hotel’s standing. About half of the hotel’s 269 rooms are booked to V.I.P.’s during the week of the race. The hotel is about a 15-minute drive from the racetrack. Weeks before the event, the hotel staff replants all the flowers, putting in begonias and hanging geranium baskets. They have a series of planning meetings where doormen, bellmen and butlers recount what each guest likes in order to make sure the hotel has that particular wine or bourbon, for example, in stock. Brian Russell, the head barman, makes a signature cocktail for each horse running in the race. “If we know the owners we will take into account what they like,” he said. “For others we try to incorporate liquors to accentuate the horse’s name.” He added: “If it’s a bubbly, energetic name we will incorporate Champagne. If it’s a serious name, something more stern, we will make a Manhattan or an old-fashioned variety.” For the week leading up to the Belmont Stakes, the hotel offers hard copies of the Daily Racing Form, which offers past performances for race entrants, odds and selections. On race day, the hotel provides a Cadillac Escalade to transport owners and jockeys to the track. “You would be surprised how many people forget to make arrangements to get to the race,” Mr. Colin said. The hotel makes $1 million during the week of the Belmont, more than double what it normally takes in during a busy summer week. From Wednesday to Sunday, the week of the race, the hotel goes through 50 cases of Champagne, 15 cases of bourbon, 25 cases of fine wine and more than 500 dry-aged steaks. The only people who really get rowdy are some of the musicians who attend the Belmont Stakes as spectators, Mr. Colin said. “It seems that some rock stars enjoy horse racing, and what’s in their coffee cup in the morning isn’t coffee,” he explained, adding that “there is an occasional suite that might take an extra day or two to get back into shape.” Another hotel fixture is Christine Moore, a milliner who usually sets up a pop-up shop by the spa, where she displays her hats. “I wait to get my hat every year until I see her,” said Anne Lynn, a horse owner who has attended the Belmont Stakes for the past 18 years. “I love trying them all on in person.” In 2015 Ms. Lynn sampled hats next to the jockey Victor Espinoza. “He won the Triple Crown the next day when he rode American Pharoah,” she said. Her husband, Bill Lynn, in recent years has enjoyed chatting with Eddie Olczyk, a sports analyst and former National Hockey League player, in the lobby. Mr. Lynn said he also uses his time at the hotel to network with people interested in buying the horses he breeds and trains. “It helps that they get to know you personally,” he said. “I don’t know why but they start to think I know something about horses.”",The New York Times
2019,Which Box Do You Check? Some States Are Offering a Nonbinary Option,"As nonbinary teenagers push for driver’s licenses that reflect their identity, a fraught debate over the nature of gender has arrived in the nation’s statehouses. BOSTON — Ever since El Martinez started asking to be called by the gender-neutral pronouns “they/them” in the ninth grade, they have fielded skepticism in a variety of forms and from a multitude of sources about what it means to identify as nonbinary. There are faculty advisers on El’s theater crew who balk at using “they” for one person; classmates at El’s public school on the outskirts of Boston who insist El can’t be “multiple people”; and commenters on El’s social media feeds who dismiss nonbinary gender identities like androgyne (a combination of masculine and feminine), agender (the absence of gender) and gender-fluid (moving between genders) as lacking a basis in biology. Even for El’s supportive parents, conceiving of gender as a multidimensional sprawl has not been so easy to grasp. Nor has El’s suggestion that everyone state their pronouns gained much traction. So last summer, when the Massachusetts State Legislature became one of the first in the nation to consider a bill to add an “X” option for nonbinary genders to the “M” and “F” on the state driver’s license, El, 17, was less surprised than some at the maneuver that effectively killed it. Beyond the catchall “X,” Representative James J. Lyons Jr. (he/him), a Republican, had proposed that the bill should be amended to offer drivers 29 other gender options, including “pangender,” “two-spirit” and “genderqueer.” Rather than open the requisite debate on each term, leaders of the Democratic-controlled House shelved the measure. “He articulated an anxiety that many people, even folks from the left, have: that there’s this slippery slope of identity, and ‘Where will it stop?’” said Ev Evnen (they/them), director of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, which is championing a new version of the bill. [Read about the reporter’s experience covering this story.] As the first sizable group of Americans to openly identify as neither only male nor only female has emerged in recent years, their requests for recognition have been met with reservations that often cross partisan lines. For their part, some nonbinary people suggest that concerns about authenticity and grammar sidestep thornier questions about the culture’s longstanding limits on how gender is supposed to be felt and expressed. “Nonbinary gender identity can be complicated,” said Mx. Evnen, 31, who uses a gender-neutral courtesy title. “It’s also threatening to an order a lot of people have learned how to navigate.” And with bills to add a nonbinary marker to driver’s licenses moving through at least six legislatures this session, the expansive conception of gender that many teenagers can trace to middle-school lunch tables is being scrutinized on a new scale. The wave of proposed gender-neutral legislation has prompted debate over whether extending legal recognition to a category of people still unknown to many Americans could undermine support for other groups vulnerable to discrimination. It has also highlighted how disorienting it can be to lose the gendered cues, like pronouns, names, appearance and mannerisms, that shape so much of social interaction. Over the last few months, lawmakers have sought — not always successfully — to use the singular “they” when introducing nonbinary constituents who have appeared to testify. The elected officials have listened to tutorials on the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity (the former is who you go to bed with, the latter is who you go to bed as); to pleas for compassion from parents who have learned to refer to their children as “my kid” rather than “son” or “daughter”; and to why being called by binary pronouns feels, as Kayden Reff (they/them), 15, of Bethesda, Md., put it in testimony read by their mother, “as though ice is being poured down my back.” “I’ve always been a liberal Democrat; it’s not like these issues are foreign to me,” said State Representative Michael Winkler (he/him), 68, of Vernon, Conn., who attended a hearing on gender-neutral identification state documents this spring. “But I’m still capable of being educated.” Some of the antipathy toward nonbinary identities may reflect a generational divide. Over a third of Americans now in their teens and early 20s know someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns, according to a recent survey by Pew Research — more than people in their later 20s and 30s, double the number of those in their 40s, and triple the number of those in their 50s and 60s. Sixty percent of the teenagers surveyed told Pew that forms asking about a person’s gender should include options other than “man” and “woman.” “Possibly it’s an age issue,” said Jocelyn Doane (she/her), 39, a longtime advocate for progressive causes in Hawaii who struggled with whether to support the gender-neutral license bill in her state. “I want to respect their challenges, but the use of ‘their’ for a single person is making me crazy.” Objections to the bills have also been raised by social conservatives, like State Senator J.B. Jennings (he/him) of Maryland, who made a distinction in public comments between transgender people who transition from male to female or vice versa, and those who identify as nonbinary. “They’re either going one way or the other, they’re not stuck in the middle,” he said. Mr. Jennings suggested that the license would be inaccurate if it listed a gender other than male or female. His argument was echoed by the California Family Council when that state became the first to adopt gender-neutral documents as law in 2017: “It advances a falsehood that being male or female or no gender at all is a choice each person must make, not a fact to celebrate and accept,” said Jonathan Keller, the group’s president. But other opponents, like the Women’s Liberation Front, an advocacy group that has submitted testimony on so-called “Gender X” bills in several states, argue that bolstering the nonbinary category will harm people who face discrimination and violence precisely because they are born with female anatomy. “To deny the reality of sex means we’re not able to name, address, and fix systemic sex-based oppression and exploitation,” said Kara Dansky (she/her) of the group’s Maryland chapter. And a state agency in Hawaii that tracks the status of women took the opposite tack, backing an alternative proposal for a limited-use ID bearing no gender marker that was introduced in addition to a bill to add the “X.” “The state does not have a legitimate interest” in identifying residents based on their gender, the agency’s testimony asserted. That bill did not advance, said its sponsor, State Senator Karl Rhoads (he/him), probably because federal law requires air travelers to carry identification that includes a gender marker, and in the island state, “the only way to get anywhere is flying.” Proponents of adding a gender-neutral option to state identification documents say it would remove a form of discrimination against nonbinary people by providing them with the means to carry identification that matches their identity. Many also hope it will lend legitimacy to a paradigm that stands to liberate people of all genders from deep-rooted social norms that penalize women for being assertive and men for showing emotion. “The gender binary is a system of control that a lot of nonbinary people are invested in destroying, and this is a step toward that,” said Jamie Grace Alexander (they/them or she/her), a 21-year-old college student who helped to craft testimony on the Maryland bill for the Baltimore Transgender Alliance. Some parents of nonbinary youths who testified at hearings acknowledged that understanding their child’s identity was a challenge at first. “Sweetie, there’s no right way to be a girl,” Sara Collina (she/her), a gender studies professor in Takoma Park, Md., recalled saying when her child first confided that they had renounced the gender they were given at birth. But several nonbinary teenagers emphasized that they were not looking for a way to be a girl or boy that stretched conventional definitions. Their gender identity was a visceral feeling, they said, not a political choice — and one that could bring with it social ostracism. “I wouldn’t wish to not be nonbinary,” Ms. Collina’s teenager (they/them), who did not want to be named, said. “But it is harder.” Scholars say that nonbinary genders have existed across history and cultures. Young Americans may now be embracing them in larger numbers, they say, because the increased visibility of people who have transitioned from one binary gender to the other suggests that there are more than two positions to occupy. “Such fluidity necessarily raises the question for all of us,” wrote Barbara Risman (she/her), a sociologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who has studied nonbinary youths, “why must our lives be organized by the legal and bureaucratic binary system that relegates everyone to one of two categories based originally on genitalia observed at birth?” Perhaps also because some critical mass has been reached, nine state motor vehicles bureaus have recently added the “X” option to driver’s licenses without involving the legislature. Several other jurisdictions, including New York City, Oregon, New Jersey and New Mexico, have also begun to allow people to change the gender on their birth certificate to “X.” The nation’s major airlines have announced that they will allow passengers to identify as an “undisclosed” or “unspecified” gender when booking tickets. And in a decision that has been appealed by the United States government, a federal judge in Colorado ruled that the State Department’s requirement that applicants choose either “M” or “F” on a passport application is not an acceptable basis on which to withhold a passport from Dana Zzyym (they/them), a military veteran who sued the department in 2014 after their request for a gender-neutral passport was denied. “This is not a matter of self-expression,” the government has argued. “This is a government form.” But the current crop of gender-neutral license bills, if signed into law, would amount to the first wave of legal recognition for nonbinary identities, legal experts said. “We didn’t want this to be just an administrative change,” said Jen Jenkins (they/them), a law student at the University of Hawaii who provided research for the bill passed by Hawaii’s Legislature last month. “We want it to last.” In some states, the bills have been introduced at the urging of parents who know that social affirmation can reduce the elevated risk of suicide and depression for gender-nonconforming children. “The gist was, their kids didn’t feel the IDs available to them reflected who they were,” said Gerri Cannon (she/her), a state representative who sponsored ID bills in New Hampshire after receiving calls from concerned parents. Nonbinary teens themselves have also petitioned for a third gender on state identity documents. Ed Luiggi (they/them), 17, president of an after-school club for gender nonconforming students, skipped school to testify before the Maryland Senate’s Judicial Proceedings Committee in Annapolis earlier this year. “My heart was racing and I was sweating a bit,” they said. It was at the same hearing that Lisa Reff (she/her), a lawyer, read the statement that her 15-year-old, Kayden, had labored to make relatable: “I wanted it to be down-to-earth but I also wanted it to sound proper,” Kayden said in a text. And the Massachusetts bill originated with a letter written by El Martinez to their state representatives: “I am planning to take driving lessons in the fall and I would be ecstatic to have a more neutral option,” it read. And this time around, El has sought to assure lawmakers that the “X” would encompass all nonconforming genders. “The ‘X,’” El told members of the Legislature’s transportation committee in late March, “is a symbol.” In Hawaii and Colorado, gender-neutral license bills have recently reached the desks of their respective governors. Maryland’s will become law, the state’s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, said last week, without his signature, effective Oct. 1. Similar measures are still under consideration in New Hampshire, New York and Connecticut. The Massachusetts bill has passed the Senate. It is now under review in the House.

2019,Which Cannes Films Will Factor Into the Oscar Race?,"The Carpetbagger Though most Oscar contenders don’t debut until the fall, last year’s Cannes Film Festival launched several films that became awards-season players, including Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” and Pawel Pawlikowski’s “Cold War.” With this year’s edition of Cannes all sewn up this weekend, which films should Oscar-watchers look out for? The biggest contender from the festival has got to be Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” with Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt as faded showbiz figures navigating 1960s Hollywood. For its spot-on re-creation of that era, Oscar nominations in production and costume design are almost assured, and the film has a good shot in cinematography as well. The biggest question is how Sony will handle DiCaprio and Pitt, who are two of the biggest stars in the industry and just about evenly split in terms of screen time. Studios rarely run two lead performances in the same category, so Sony may try to classify Pitt as supporting. DiCaprio’s washed-up actor has the biggest emotional arc, and Pitt’s stuntman character is in his employ and thus technically subordinate to him. It would be bunk, but after Mahershala Ali won a supporting-actor trophy just months ago for what was essentially a colead performance, the gambit would at least give Pitt a strong shot at his first acting trophy. [Read about the Cannes winners this year.] In the supporting-actress category, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate has an affecting second-act scene in which she sneaks into a theater to watch herself on the big screen. But the character is more of a symbolic presence than a really fleshed-out role, and Robbie doesn’t speak her first line until at least an hour into the movie. She’ll need to hope that Oscar voters respond so strongly to Tarantino’s film that it cracks the picture, director and screenplay categories, a show of force that would help sweep her in. Actors from other Cannes films with a shot at being nominated include Willem Dafoe, who chews scenery with aplomb as an old-timey seaman in “The Lighthouse,” and Taron Egerton, who delivers a spirited turn as Elton John in “Rocketman” but may be hamstrung by Rami Malek’s recent, too-similar Oscar win for playing Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Also keep an eye on Antonio Banderas, who is subtle and moving in Pedro Almodóvar’s “Pain and Glory,” in which he plays a thinly veiled stand-in for his director. Banderas has never been nominated for an Oscar before, but he charmed the Cannes press with funny and emotional stories about his long career, and if the 58-year-old actor hits the awards circuit with that same gusto, he’ll be irresistible. “Pain and Glory” ought to be a strong contender for the international-film category (previously known as best foreign language film), too, if Spain submits it. The same goes for the Senegalese drama “Atlantics,” which Netflix acquired: Its director, Mati Diop, was the first black female director in Cannes competition, and she took the festival’s second-place prize. Other laureled films like Brazil’s “Bacurau” and France’s lesbian love story “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” deserve consideration, too. What of Terrence Malick’s “A Hidden Life,” which Fox Searchlight picked up for an eye-popping price of around $14 million? Malick hasn’t made a significant dent in Oscar season since his 2011 film, “The Tree of Life,” and reactions to his latest were somewhat split: Some pundits thought it was a whole lot of metaphysical woo-woo, while others found Malick to be back on track with the story of an Austrian farmer who refuses to fight for the Nazis. The size of the sale indicates that Fox Searchlight will push this one hard, but without big stars or a director willing to do press, can “A Hidden Life” go the distance? And then there’s the winner of the Palme d’Or, Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite.” No Korean film has been nominated for the international Oscar before, but “Parasite” is so strong it could even blow past that category to factor into directing and screenplay races, if upstart distributor Neon plays its cards right. An urgent story of class struggle told in the most sensationally entertaining way, “Parasite” is Bong at his best, and the academy must take note.",The New York Times
2019,Which Sloane Stephens Will Show Up at the French Open?,"On Tennis PARIS — New ring. New coach. No more “Game of Thrones.” Sloane Stephens’s 2019 season officially began in January. But in her mind, she is starting fresh this month, and there is certainly no shortage of symbolism as Stephens returns to the red clay of Roland Garros, where she was a finalist last year. She and her longtime boyfriend, Jozy Altidore, announced their engagement on April 29. Three days later, she announced that she had hired the veteran coach Sven Groeneveld to fill the void left by her split with Kamau Murray. “I needed some stability, and I needed structure,” Stephens said. “And now I feel I have someone on my team who really gets it and gets what I’m going through.” The early results have been promising, if mixed. After going 8-7 on tour through April, Stephens made a strong run in her first tournament with Groeneveld — to the semifinals of the Madrid Open. She then lost in her opening round at the Italian Open in three sets to the eventual runner-up, Johanna Konta. “For me, my season is starting now,” Stephens said in an interview in Madrid. “I kind of had a rocky first four months of the year, and I’m just kind of getting it going now.” [What’s new at the French Open? Read about the new greenhouse court and other renovations.] Stephens, one of the game’s great and most unpredictable talents, has experienced extreme momentum swings. In the late summer of 2017, she came back from a long injury layoff to win the United States Open. She then lost eight straight singles matches before emerging from her funk last spring, winning the Miami Open and reaching the final of the French Open. When you least expect her, expect her. “She’s one of those players who can snap out of it at any moment,” said Paul Annacone, one of her numerous former coaches. “I wouldn’t be surprised at all if she’s playing for the title again in Paris.” Stephens came close to winning it last year, taking an early lead against Simona Halep before losing eight of the final nine games and the match, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. Halep, winless in her first three Grand Slam finals, finally shed the burden. “It just wasn’t my time,” Stephens said. “She was bound to win a Slam, and that was just how it was supposed to be. I can accept that fully.” Stephens took this destiny-rules approach often during our interview. She remains an enigmatic figure to many in the game: clearly a potential No. 1 with her blend of defensive prowess and baseline power but passive to a fault on occasion. She is dictating more often with her huge, versatile forehand, but still not enough in the view of many experts. “I think every player has a default mode under great pressure, and I think her default mode is reactive,” Annacone said. “Her default mode is: ‘I’m a great mover. It’s a big moment, and I’m going to move, and I’m not going to miss.’” Then again, Stephens’s default mode has been good enough to win one major, to reach the final of another and to claim the runner-up’s spot at last year’s WTA Finals in Singapore, often considered the fifth most important annual event on tour. Ranked No. 3 last July, she is now No. 7, at a time when no woman is dominating week to week but many are emboldened. “It is an open space, so any little extra edge can help a lot,” she said. “So that’s what I want to try to achieve with Sven.” Stephens attributes some of her wide-ranging results in the past two years to adjusting psychologically to the demands generated by her surprise U.S. Open victory. “I was living such a normal life,” she said. “And then I decided — well, I didn’t decide — but it just so happened that I played a month of insane tennis, and I was like: ‘I’m not ready for this, like, I don’t want to be ready for this.’ I woke up the day after the final, and I was like, ‘Damn, what did I just do?’” She also acknowledged playing through injuries and malaise in order to avoid paying a price: the big fines for not participating in top tour events. “If I’m not prepared to play a tournament, I probably shouldn’t play,” she said. Groeneveld, a 53-year-old Dutchman, has coached a long list of champions, including Mary Pierce, Michael Stich, Ana Ivanovic, Caroline Wozniacki and Maria Sharapova, with whom he split on good terms in March 2018. Groeneveld declined to speak publicly about Sharapova during his four years as her coach and is taking the same approach with Stephens. “I am focusing on one thing only,” he said, “and that is building my coaching relationship with Sloane.” Neither Stephens nor Murray has fully explained their split. Murray helped Stephens come back from an injury and win the U.S. Open. They took a break near the end of last season, and that break eventually became permanent. “We had some great results, but sometimes you just get to a point where it’s time to let go and look for other things,” Stephens said, declining to elaborate. Stephens has worked with many a mentor — including Nick Saviano, Roger Smith, David Nainkin, Thomas Hogstedt and Annacone — but is sensitive to the suggestion that she is prone to hiring and firing. “There are different circumstances,” she said. “Sometimes I do need a new voice, or we’re not connecting, or it’s: ‘I don’t want you to get a divorce. Go home and be with your family.’” But she does concede that her coaching timeline makes for a long paragraph on Wikipedia. “You just look at it, and it’s like, ‘Damn, there are 12 people on here!’” she said, laughing. “But everyone I ever worked with, I still talk to and still communicate with. I love them.” Stephens can be vivacious, funny and profane in an interview. She is also a “Game of Thrones” aficionado whose social-media accounts could be in danger of going dark now that the show has ended. But she is more often guarded, a consequence of early-career interviews in which she felt she shared too much. She said her challenges early in life were also part of the reason for holding back her emotions: Her stepfather, Sheldon Farrell, died of cancer in 2007, and her biological father, the former N.F.L. running back John Stephens, died in a car crash in 2009 shortly after they had re-established a relationship. “People will be like, ‘You’re not trying,’” she said. “But it’s not that. It’s more I’m not in the place where things are going great, and I don’t show it or don’t say, ‘I’m really unhappy, guys.’ I think me being kind of neutral all the time has kind of worked against me, but I feel I’m that way because when I was younger I had a lot of ups and downs, and emotionally it was hard to deal with a lot of trauma. So I kind of just turn off at a certain point.” At the moment, however, she is on a high. She and Altidore, a 29-year-old forward with the United States men’s national soccer team and Toronto F.C. of Major League Soccer, have known each other since childhood. He has tremendous speed. So does Stephens. Watch out for any future offspring. “You should invest in them now,” Stephens joked. She said that she and Altidore had yet to set a date for the wedding and that planning could be a challenge as they juggle two professional sports. “I don’t know who is making my dress; I literally have no information,” Stephens said. “I just kind of need a moment to soak it all in and say: ‘It’s O.K. It’s happening.’” She added: “We both are very, very busy, so naturally the first thing that is coming to both of our minds is not like, ‘Do you have any details on the wedding?’ He’s more like, ‘How do you feel after your match?’” The answer for now, after a demoralizing start to 2019, is better. What comes next in Paris or at Wimbledon? Not even Stephens knows, but what’s clear is the potential for more tennis transcendence. “With Serena not full time anymore, to me Sloane is the most talented woman on the tour,” Annacone said. “I think she’s just a freak of a talent.”",The New York Times
2019,Which Television Shows Are You Sad to See Come to an End?,"Student Opinion Will you watch the final episodes of “The Big Bang Theory” or “Game of Thrones?” Do you think they can live up to the expectations and hype? Or, do you think you will be disappointed? In “‘The Big Bang Theory’ and the Long Goodbye: How Swan Songs Are Changing TV,” Margaret Lyons writes: Two of the biggest shows on TV are ending this week: “The Big Bang Theory” finishes its 12th season on Thursday, and “Game of Thrones” ends its eighth season Sunday night. One’s a multicamera comedy that fits squarely within network traditions, the other’s a flashy fantasy epic chockablock with violent murder. One is symbolic — perhaps unfairly — of cultural uncoolness, while the other spawns viewing parties and obsessive podcasts from legacy media companies. And yet both are getting the same kind of finale rollout, the kind a lot of shows get these days, like “Veep” just had: an announcement well in advance of the premiere that the coming season would be the show’s last, a full-court media press of oral histories and it’s-hard-but-it’s-time talk show appearances, well-placed tributes from high-profile fans. Clip shows and after-shows. Photos from the final table read on the cast’s Instagram accounts, and then maybe a photo essay of the final days in a magazine. We’ve had months and months to gird ourselves. Which isn’t to say those finales will necessarily be good or beloved, just that fans of the shows have been well shepherded into the ideas that these shows are indeed ending. Big shows have always gotten fanfare finale rollouts, but in recent years, and especially for the 2018-19 season, network, cable and streaming outlets have been big on farewell seasons for smaller shows too. Netflix gave viewers ample warning about the end of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.” The final season of “Broad City” was one big goodbye, an almost therapeutic guide through the main characters’ maturation process and thus the end of the freewheeling-young-adult premise of the show. “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” walked its audience and its protagonist through all the show’s what-ifs. The series finale of “Catastrophe” achieved a kind of ecstatic perfection that gave me spiritual resolution in ways I cannot attain in regular life. I will be crushed when “Jane the Virgin” ends this summer, but I will be as prepared as possible. Every living person who watched FXX’s “You’re the Worst” wrote a loving eulogy to it on a website, or ranked its episodes, or praised its depictions of PTSD and depression one last time. Transitions, man. Anyone who’s ever torn a toddler from a playground or nudged a crowd from cocktail hour to the reception hall knows people need warning. We need structure. We need guidance. We need a dang minute to collect ourselves. We need closure. The article concludes: Finales have taken on a strange significance of their own as “sticking the landing” has become a meme unto itself — but also as reboots and revivals have meant the end of endings. They are now a precious spectacle, an impossible beauty, a relic. So having time to prepare the shrine doesn’t feel like so much to ask. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — Which television shows are you sad to see end this season? Why will you miss them? What do you like about them? — Are you a big fan of “Big Bang Theory”? What about “Game of Thrones”? Are you watching either of the final episodes? If you’re answering this question before watching the finale, how do you think the show will end? If you’ve already watched the finale, what did you think? Did it “stick the landing”? — How much television do you watch? Is it still a popular medium with you and your peers? What shows do you absolutely never miss? Which shows do you think “it’s time to go”? — In “‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘Avengers’: 2 Times Critics on the Power and Pain of Endings,” A.O. Scott says: Truthfully though, most endings are disappointing, at least in proportion to the complexity and interest of the story that came before. We feel let down partly because we’re just sorry something we’ve invested time and feeling in is over, but also because the force that held us in thrall is dissipating. The classical genres sidestep this problem by spoiling everything in advance. A tragedy ends in death, a comedy in a wedding, with some suspense about who dies or who gets married. The release an audience experiences at the end is partly relief that the order of things, disrupted by the anarchic forces of violence or desire, has been restored. Modern narrative is a different beast, of course, and what “Thrones,” which originated in a series of novels, shares with other canonical examples of the genre is a sense of multiple, branching possibilities, a thick and tangled middle full of intriguing loose ends. The tying up all that involves foreclosing some possibilities in favor of others. Solutions tend to be less exciting than mysteries. — Do you agree that most endings are disappointing?

2019,"While Enes Kanter is Observing Ramadan, the World Will Be Watching Him","On Monday, around 4 a.m., Enes Kanter will wake up, eat a light breakfast of yogurt, fruit and peanut butter, and drink as much water as he can. Then for the roughly 16 hours between sunrise and sunset in Portland, Ore., the center for the Portland Trail Blazers will abstain from eating, drinking and taking medicine, even for the shoulder he separated almost two weeks ago. For Kanter, a Swiss-born Turk who has fasted for Ramadan while playing competitive basketball for the past decade, the routine is nothing new. But this time, the circumstances may be: Never before has he fasted while playing in the N.B.A.’s postseason. This year, with Ramadan beginning on Sunday, his fast will come during Portland’s second-round series against the Denver Nuggets. He’s averaging nearly 20 points and more than 10 rebounds per game against Denver, and has been a surprise difference-maker for the Blazers behind Damian Lillard. In Islam, Ramadan commemorates the month that God started to reveal the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad, and each year roughly 1.5 billion people observe it through daytime fasting, during which smoking, sex and chewing gum are also prohibited. In Muslim-majority countries like Turkey, where Kanter grew up, businesses and schools often adjust their hours to accommodate the observance. In the United States, it’s business as usual for most of the estimated 3.45 million Muslims, including Kanter. He’s become accustomed to fasting by himself. The first time Kanter observed Ramadan while training seriously for basketball, he was 16 years old, living in Turkey and playing for a team with an international roster. That year, Ramadan started at the end of August — each year, it moves back by about 11 days — and the first two-a-day practice was grueling for Kanter. “I was going against players who were 30, 35 years old, and I was the only one fasting,” he said. “When I would break my fast, I was drinking so much water, like ‘Man, there’s no room left for food.’” Since then, Kanter has spent Ramadan in California, where he attended prep school; in Lexington, where he was recruited to play for the University of Kentucky; and with three N.B.A. franchises before the Trail Blazers: the Utah Jazz, the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Knicks. Though there have been other Muslims in the league (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar converted to Islam in 1968, a year before he began a 20-season N.B.A. career, and Hakeem Olajuwon was known for playing well while fasting), Kanter still makes a point of telling teams about the duties of his faith. “Before I go to those teams, I say, ‘Hey, I’m a Muslim and I have to pray five times a day,’” Kanter said. “And they respect it so much that they give me a prayer room. So before the game, after the game, before practice, before I fly out, I can go to that room whenever I want and pray.” After he joins a new franchise, Kanter said, there are always questions at first, like why he doesn’t drink alcohol, but they’re typically asked with good intentions. In fact, an Oklahoma City strength coach was so curious about Ramadan that he fasted for three days to better understand Kanter’s nutritional needs. The teams also provide special meals for Kanter, which some of his teammates have grown to love. “Steven Adams was a very, very big fan of halal food,” Kanter said of the Thunder center, “and I remember the day I got traded to the Knicks, he was so sad. He was like, ‘Man, I’m not going to eat halal food anymore.’” Though the past few Ramadans have been during his off-season, Kanter enjoys the feeling of fasting so much that he does it once or twice a week year-round. That routine has helped reassure him that his cravings, typically at their worst 15 minutes after basketball practice, will eventually pass. Even traveling from the East Coast to the West, which adds three hours to the fast, no longer rattles him. “If you can do 15,” he said, “you can do 18.” Fasting doesn’t necessarily pose a nutritional problem for Kanter, said Dr. Richard Bloomer, dean of the School of Health Studies and the Center for Wellness and Fitness at the University of Memphis. “A lot of people think, ‘Gee, my carbohydrate or glycogen stores could be depleted,’” he said. “That would be problematic, but the reality is, if they’re eating adequately during the ‘acceptable’ feeding period, they should be able to store all of the energy that they need.” Recent studies have shown that fasting can both help and hurt an athlete’s anaerobic performance; Dr. Bloomer said that players’ experiences also depended on their mind-sets. If Kanter believes that fasting inhibits his play, it may, “even though there may not be physiological adverse outcomes,” Dr. Bloomer said. For Kanter, though, that’s not a problem. “I actually work harder during Ramadan because my body’s used to it,” he said. Tareq Azim, a San Francisco-based N.F.L. trainer who was a linebacker at Fresno State, felt the same. “The level of clarity during Ramadan was just always insane — the way I can think and take in information,” Azim said. “Technically, I’d become really sound during that month. I wouldn’t rely so much on strength and power.” Azim remembered a particular game against Colorado State, when he was on the field well after the sun had set. During a break, a concerned teammate rushed out and squirted water into his mouth. “He was like, ‘You got to break the fast, man. You got to get something in you,’” Azim said. “I felt so light, like I was floating. And I always see that reference point when I feel like breaking during Ramadan. It’s almost like you generate a second wind.” Like Kanter, Azim has learned to cope with the challenges of fasting during Ramadan as he’s gotten older. In the fifth grade, when he started attempting to fast for Ramadan, he’d wake up with his parents around 4 a.m. to eat suhur, the meal right before sunrise. “It’d be so difficult to try and stay up and eat,” he said. “I’d sit up and maybe put a bite of an egg in my mouth and literally fall right over.” After a few more hours of sleep, Azim would fast for as long as he could, but with nothing in his stomach, it wasn’t easy. “Sometimes I would last until 10 a.m.,” he said. As Kanter prepares for Game 5 of Portland’s second-round series against the Nuggets, he, too, will be wary of missing that last meal before sunrise and having to fast an extra 15 hours. He has a plan. “That’s why I always put my phone away from my bed,” he said, “to make sure that I don’t fall back asleep and skip suhur.”",The New York Times
2019,White House Again Rejects Democrats’ Requests for Documents in Corruption Inquiry,"The White House on Wednesday rejected another round of document requests from the House, expanding on its assertions that Democrats in Congress lacked a legitimate legislative purpose for the demands and were inappropriately replicating the work of the special counsel. The letter from the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, laid out a series of arguments, saying essentially that Congress was not a law enforcement body and does not have the standing to investigate the president. The letter stopped short of asserting executive privilege over the documents, which relate to 81 individuals and entities connected to the president or his campaign and inauguration. The documents are being sought by the House Judiciary Committee for its investigation into possible obstruction of justice, abuse of power and corruption. But the letter framed the requests as overly broad. And it suggested that the committee was trying to get another crack at material the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had already reviewed at great length. “Congressional investigations are intended to obtain information to aid in evaluating potential legislation, not to harass political opponents or to pursue an unauthorized ‘do-over’ of exhaustive law enforcement investigations conducted by the Department of Justice,” Mr. Cipollone wrote in the 12-page letter, which was first reported by ABC News. The letter added, “If the committee intends to continue its inquiry, it would greatly advance that process if the committee were to narrow the scope of the requests in the March 4 letter and articulate the legislative purpose and legal basis supporting each of the remaining requests.” Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called the letter “outrageous.” “They say the Justice Department can’t hold him accountable since a sitting president cannot be indicted,” Mr. Nadler said. “And now they’re saying that Congress cannot hold a president accountable. This is ridiculous.” Mr. Nadler has repeatedly made the case that Congress is exercising its powers properly and that the White House has no legal basis to object to its requests for information. The Judiciary Committee opened its inquiry into the Trump administration in early March, before any conclusions of the special counsel were known, and dispatched dozens of letters demanding information from government officials, agencies, businesses and associates of Mr. Trump. The aggressive approach infuriated Republicans, who accused Mr. Nadler of opening a presidential impeachment inquiry in everything but name. At the time, Mr. Nadler and committee Democrats made clear that they saw their work as independent of the special counsel’s investigation, and that it would go on regardless of Mr. Mueller’s findings. Mr. Cipollone’s letter, and others sent by the White House Counsel’s Office, lay out arguments that they would probably use in court if House officials sought to force the Trump administration to comply. In a court hearing on Tuesday, personal lawyers for Mr. Trump made similar arguments in a legal dispute over a subpoena by the House oversight committee for Mr. Trump’s financial records from his accounting firm: essentially, that Congress is trying to conduct a law-enforcement investigation, which is outside its purview, and lacks a legitimate legislative purpose. The court dispute over the subpoena for Mr. Trump’s financial records does not involve a claim of executive privilege, a shield that covers only internal executive branch communications. But Mr. Cipollone’s letter laid out additional arguments for why he said Congress had no right to information like underlying documents and testimony concerning matters laid out in the Mueller report. Still, Mr. Cipollone’s letter glossed over one of the most important challenges for Mr. Trump in his effort to keep Congress from obtaining such information, including documents and testimony about his communications with aides like Donald F. McGahn II, his former White House counsel: The executive branch has already made the gist of those communications public by releasing most of the Mueller report. In a 2016 decision involving a congressional subpoena for confidential internal Justice Department emails, a federal judge ruled that President Barack Obama could not use executive privilege to keep those messages private. The ruling turned on the fact that the executive branch had released an inspector general report that described and quoted their contents, so letting lawmakers see the underlying materials would impose no additional harm to the executive branch’s confidentiality interests. Mr. Cipollone’s letter used a parenthetical to brush off the implications of the disclosures the executive branch had already made. He emphasized that Mr. Trump’s decision not to assert executive privilege over the now-public portions of the Mueller report was “not a waiver of executive privilege for any other material or for any other purpose,” but he offered no rationale to explain why the Obama-era ruling would not apply in the present dispute.",The New York Times

2019,White House Asked McGahn to Declare Trump Never Obstructed Justice,"WASHINGTON — White House officials asked at least twice in the past month for the key witness against President Trump in the Mueller report, Donald F. McGahn II, to say publicly that he never believed the president obstructed justice, according to two people briefed on the requests. Mr. Trump asked White House officials to make the request to Mr. McGahn, who was the president’s first White House counsel, one of the people said. Mr. McGahn declined. His reluctance angered the president, who believed that Mr. McGahn showed disloyalty by telling investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, about Mr. Trump’s attempts to maintain control over the Russia investigation. The White House made one of the requests to Mr. McGahn’s lawyer, William A. Burck, before the Mueller report was released publicly but after the Justice Department gave a copy to Mr. Trump’s lawyers in the preceding days. Reading the report, the president’s lawyers saw that Mr. Mueller left out that Mr. McGahn had told investigators that he believed the president never obstructed justice. Mr. Burck had told them months earlier about his client’s belief on the matter and that he had shared it with investigators. Mr. McGahn initially entertained the White House request. “We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister,” Mr. Burck said in a statement. “It was a request, professionally and cordially made.” A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a message seeking comment. But after the report was released, detailing the range of actions Mr. Trump took to try to impede the inquiry, Mr. McGahn decided to pass on putting out a statement supportive of the president. The report also revealed that Mr. Trump told aides he believed Mr. McGahn had leaked to the news media to make himself look good. A partially redacted report of the special counsel’s findings released on April 18 cited interviews with 43 individuals at least 10 times. The episodes show the lengths the White House has gone around the release of the Mueller report to push back on the notion that Mr. Trump obstructed justice. House Democrats have used the report to open investigations into whether Mr. Trump abused his position to insulate himself from the Russia inquiry. The revelations came as the Democrats on Friday increased their pressure on the White House on other fronts. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard E. Neal, subpoenaed the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service for six years of Mr. Trump’s personal and business tax returns. Democrats are also pursuing testimony from Mr. Mueller but have not agreed on a date, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters. In the days after the report was released, White House officials asked Mr. McGahn again to put out a statement as Mr. Trump fumed about his disclosures but Mr. McGahn rebuffed the second request as well. White House officials believed that Mr. McGahn publicly asserting his belief would calm the president and help the administration push back on the episodes that Mr. Mueller detailed in the obstruction section of the report, said one of the people. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the White House. Around the time Mr. McGahn declined the second request, the president’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani began publicly attacking his credibility, saying that Mr. McGahn had a bad memory. “It can’t be taken at face value,” Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. McGahn’s account one day after the Mueller report was released. “It could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.” The White House learned in August that Mr. McGahn had told Mr. Mueller’s investigators that he believed the president had not obstructed justice, according to one of the people. After a New York Times article revealed that Mr. McGahn had spoken to investigators for at least 30 hours, Mr. Burck tried to reassure the White House by explaining that his client told Mr. Mueller that he never believed Mr. Trump had committed an obstruction offense. Mr. McGahn’s cooperation with Mr. Mueller played a crucial role in allowing the special counsel’s investigators to paint a picture in their report of a president determined to use his power atop the executive branch to protect himself from the Russia investigation. The findings from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, are now available to the public. The redacted report details his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The president’s lawyers are particularly concerned about two episodes that Mr. McGahn detailed to prosecutors. In one, Mr. Trump asked him to fire the special counsel but backed off after Mr. McGahn refused. After that episode was revealed, the president asked Mr. McGahn to create a White House document falsely rebutting his account. Mr. McGahn declined to go along but told Mr. Mueller about the encounters. It makes no difference legally whether Mr. McGahn believes Mr. Trump obstructed justice. That is a determination made by prosecutors, not witnesses. But politically, such a statement could have been a powerful argument for Mr. Trump, who faces scrutiny from House Democrats about whether he obstructed justice and abused his power. Mr. Mueller declined to make a determination about whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, saying that because a sitting president cannot be indicted, it was unfair to accuse him of committing a crime. Attorney General William P. Barr stepped in and decided with his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, to clear Mr. Trump of wrongdoing. But because Mr. Mueller made no determination — and wrote a damning report that showed repeated efforts by Mr. Trump to interfere with his inquiry — questions about whether the president obstructed justice have lingered as Democrats have sought to gain momentum in their investigation of Mr. Trump. The Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed Mr. McGahn to testify. But White House advisers have indicated they will try to block him from appearing before lawmakers, and Mr. Trump has said that there is no reason for Mr. McGahn to speak with congressional investigators because he had cooperated so extensively with Mr. Mueller’s team. “I’ve had him testifying already for 30 hours and it’s really — so I don’t think I can let him and then tell everybody else you can’t,” Mr. Trump said last week in an interview with Fox News. “Especially him, because he was a counsel, so they’ve testified for many hours, all of them, many, many, many people. I can’t say, ‘Well, one can and the others can’t.’ I would say it’s done.” Mr. McGahn left the White House last year but is still entangled with the president on matters related to the Mueller investigation. The White House instructed Mr. McGahn on Tuesday to not turn over documents he had to the House in response to a subpoena. Mr. McGahn followed the White House’s advice and is now waiting to see whether Democrats will hold him in contempt.",The New York Times
2019,White House Asks Congress for Billions More in Border Funding,"WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Wednesday to allocate $4.5 billion in emergency funds for the southwestern border as federal agencies struggle to house and cope with the influx of asylum seekers coming into the United States. The request, which includes about $3.3 billion to house unaccompanied migrant children, feed and care for migrants in custody and staff processing centers, is unlikely to pass the Democrat-controlled House without changes. It would not halt the surge of Central American families crossing the southwestern border, but it would allow the Department of Homeland Security to add beds at migrant processing facilities and detention facilities. The request also includes more than $2.8 billion — more than half of the money requested — for the Department of Health and Human Services to care for more than 23,000 unaccompanied children. Democrats have already questioned the billions of dollars that President Trump previously requested in his budget for border security and are embroiled in a lawsuit over Mr. Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency to build a border wall. But Russell T. Vought, the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, warned in a letter to lawmakers that if the request was not fulfilled, other resources — including money for refugees and victims of human trafficking and torture — within the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies would have to be tapped for services at the southwestern border. Funds for undocumented children could run out as early as June, he said. “The additional resources hereby requested will enable federal agencies to address the immediate humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border of the United States,” Mr. Vought wrote. “Because the need for this funding arises from an unprecedented rise in the numbers and composition of the migrant population,” he added, “these resources should be provided as emergency funding.” House Democrats will most likely agree to some of the funds, one Democratic aide said, particularly the requests for food, diapers and fundamental necessities for migrants taken into custody at the border. But some enforcement funding — including money for detention beds, which could help the administration detain more undocumented immigrants — are likely to be nonstarters. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that much of the request was meant to “double down on cruel and ill-conceived policies.” “Locking up people who pose no threat to the community for ever-longer periods of time is not a solution to the problems at the border,” Ms. Lowey said in a statement, adding that the committee would review the request and work with the White House and the Senate “where possible.” The new emergency request for border funds arrived on Capitol Hill before Congress has been able to reach an agreement on a much larger emergency package for people recovering from the onslaught of natural disasters last year. Democrats are reviewing the latest Republican offer, from Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, that includes additional money for Puerto Rico’s recovery from hurricanes in 2017. (Mr. Trump told Democrats on Tuesday, “I’ll stay out of it; just get it done,” according to a congressional official familiar with the meeting.) Homeland security officials have said for months that their facilities and resources have been pushed beyond capacity because of a surge in Central American families seeking asylum at the border. Next week, officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement will start conducting DNA tests on some migrants to determine if they are actually relatives, homeland security officials said on Wednesday. The pilot program, which would involve comparing DNA swabs of children and the adults they are traveling with, would be used to weed out fraudulent families. The testing is voluntary and requires the consent of the migrant. Since April 18, more than 100 migrants have been suspected of fraud, officials said. Thousands of migrants are approaching the border a day. Kevin McAleenan, the acting homeland security secretary, said on Tuesday that the processing facilities at the border were built for single adult males, but they now house more asylum-seeking families and unaccompanied children, who require a longer processing time. On a call with reporters, senior administration officials underscored that the situation at the border was becoming more “dire” each day and noted that apprehensions were expected to surpass one million by the end of the year. One official sidestepped a question about whether these measures were being taken in preparation for the administration to reinstitute a family separation policy at the border. But the request, they said, was devised to better handle a surge in family units and unaccompanied children that were crossing the border. None of the requested funds — which also include $1.1 billion for operations and $178 million in mission support for personnel and resources — will go toward the construction of a wall at the southwestern border, an official said. Earlier on Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers repeatedly criticized Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, over the reallocation of Pentagon funds toward the construction of a border wall. Mr. Shanahan said he had canceled a trip to Europe this week in part to continue monitoring the situation at the border. Mr. Shanahan also voiced a veiled criticism of the enduring presence of troops on the border, telling lawmakers that the deployment had not affected readiness, but that the Pentagon needed to get back to its “primary” missions.",The New York Times
2019,"White House Insider Account Has Feel of an Outside View, and Prompts a Mueller Denial","WASHINGTON — Two years ago, the author Michael Wolff parlayed his access to one of President Trump’s most powerful advisers, Stephen K. Bannon, into “Fire and Fury,” a rollicking, behind-the-scenes account of Mr. Trump’s chaotic White House. The book sold more than four million copies, despite lingering questions about its accuracy. Now, Mr. Wolff is back with a sequel, “Siege: Trump Under Fire,” which appears to rely just as heavily on Mr. Bannon. But the author’s source left the White House in August 2017 and has watched Mr. Trump’s circuslike presidency from afar since. That gives the disclosures in Mr. Wolff’s latest book a secondhand feeling — and one of his most sensational claims drew a quick, emphatic rebuttal. A spokesman for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, denied Mr. Wolff’s claim that in March 2018, Mr. Mueller was preparing to indict the president for obstruction of justice on three counts, including witness tampering. Andrew Weissmann, one of Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors, who Mr. Wolff says led that effort, did not even work on the part of the investigation that focused on obstruction. In an author’s note, Mr. Wolff said his account of Mr. Mueller’s investigation was based on “internal documents given to me by sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel.” But in a rare on-the-record denial, the special counsel’s spokesman, Peter Carr, said on Tuesday that “the documents described do not exist.” Mr. Wolff responded in an interview, “My source is impeccable, and I have no doubt about the authenticity and the significance of the documents.” The criticism of his work puts Mr. Wolff in a familiar position. The White House lashed out after the publication of “Fire and Fury,” calling it “trashy tabloid fiction.” A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, tried to block its publication and threatened to sue the publisher, Henry Holt & Company, for libel. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that the book was “full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist.” Copies of “Siege” have begun circulating in advance of its publication on June 4, and The New York Times obtained one. But the disclosures in the book, first reported on Tuesday by The Guardian, did not provoke the storm of coverage on social media and cable television that helped propel the sales of Mr. Wolff’s last book into the stratosphere. The findings from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, are now available to the public. The redacted report details his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. That may reflect both the questions of accuracy that hung over “Fire and Fury” and a growing jadedness with inside accounts of the Trump White House. Bob Woodward’s best-selling book “Fear” and other accounts have depicted a now-familiar tableau of hapless, scheming aides and an impulsive, erratic president distracted by his legal battles and obsessed with the talking heads on Fox News. For his first book, Mr. Wolff spent time in the West Wing, often in Mr. Bannon’s office. He does not claim to have had similar access this time, noting that many of his original sources have left the White House. In his author’s note, Mr. Wolff acknowledged that those sources were not trustworthy. “For the writer,” he said, “interviewing such Janus-faced sources creates a dilemma, for it requires depending on people who lie to also tell the truth — and who might later disavow the truth they have told.” Mr. Wolff is open about his reliance on Mr. Bannon, whom he thanks in the acknowledgments, describing him as “the most cleareyed interpreter of the Trump phenomenon I know” and “the Virgil anyone might be lucky to have as a guide for a descent into Trumpworld.” Even after Mr. Bannon left the White House, Mr. Wolff said he exercised considerable power over the president’s agenda. He helped push Mr. Trump into declaring a national emergency to obtain funding for his border wall. Although he quotes Mr. Bannon as saying that Mr. Trump is “not the billionaire he said he was, just another scumbag,” he also thought constantly about going back to him. The Mueller investigation forms the centerpiece of the book, and Mr. Wolff offers an unusual glimpse into the grand jury, which has heard testimony under a veil of secrecy for months. “The Mueller grand jurors were more female than male,” he wrote, “more white than black, older rather than younger; they were distinguished most of all by their intensity and focus.” But Mr. Wolff’s account of the purported draft indictment contained several puzzling elements. He quoted the title of the draft as “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA - against - DONALD J. TRUMP Defendant,” while the usual formulation would be to use the abbreviation “v.” for versus, not “against.” All of the indictments secured by the special counsel use “v.” Moreover, the purported document says that Mr. Trump could be indicted under three obstruction of justice laws, known as Section 1505, Section 1512 and Section 1513 of Title 18 of the United States code. Yet around that time, a representative of Mr. Mueller’s told Mr. Trump’s legal team that the president was not under investigation under Section 1505, but rather only under Section 1512, according to a person briefed on that conversation. Mr. Mueller’s representative did not bring up Section 1513, the person said. That exchange took place after Mr. Trump’s legal team sent Mr. Mueller a letter arguing that Mr. Trump could not have committed obstruction of justice, raising arguments focused exclusively on a technical problem raised by the wording of Section 1505. In response, a representative of Mr. Mueller’s office told Mr. Trump’s lawyers that they were focused on the wrong law, the person said, and should instead look at Section 1512. Mr. Wolff portrayed Mr. Weissmann as bitterly disappointed by his boss’s refusal to indict the president. But Mr. Weissmann focused on the case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, and other defendants. Two other lawyers, James L. Quarles III and Andrew D. Goldstein, were primarily involved in looking at whether Mr. Trump committed obstruction. On more minor details, Mr. Wolff’s book has the same hit-or-miss quality. Mr. Trump did refer to one of his lawyers, Ty Cobb, as Cy Young — either deliberately or accidentally using the name of another baseball great for his lawyer’s namesake. But Mr. Wolff also claims that Attorney General William P. Barr viewed taking his job as a “payday,” calculating that if he managed to avoid both a constitutional crisis and the destruction of the Republican Party, “there were many, many future millions in it for him.” Friends of Mr. Barr’s said that claim was ludicrous. A 69-year-old former corporate lawyer, Mr. Barr listed more than $22 million in assets and income on his financial disclosure form. “He needed another stint in government like he needed a root canal,” said Jonathan Turley, a longtime friend and professor at George Washington University Law School.",The New York Times
2019,White House May Lift Sanctions on Venezuelan Officials Who Reject Maduro,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration would consider lifting sanctions on Venezuelan officials who abandoned the government of President Nicolás Maduro and joined the opposition seeking to topple him, Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday. “The United States of America will consider sanctions relief for all those who step forward, stand up for the Constitution and support the rule of law,” Mr. Pompeo said at the annual Washington Conference on the Americas, held at the State Department. To emphasize his point, Mr. Pence said the United States was removing sanctions imposed against Gen. Manuel Cristopher Figuera, an intelligence chief who defected recently to support Juan Guaidó, the head of Venezuela’s National Assembly. In January, Mr. Guaidó cited the country’s Constitution in naming himself interim president and accusing Mr. Maduro of trying to remain in power for a second term on the basis of an illegitimate election last year. Soon after, President Trump recognized Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president and called on Mr. Maduro to relinquish his authoritarian leadership amid his disastrous economic policies. More than 50 nations have recognized Mr. Guaidó. But Mr. Maduro has held onto power, mainly because he has the support of military leaders. He is also supported by several nations, notably Russia and Cuba. On Tuesday, Mr. Pence said the United States had imposed sanctions on more than 150 Venezuelan officials and state-owned companies. In late January, the Trump administration announced what was essentially an oil embargo on Venezuela, in an effort to cut off purchases of oil by the country’s largest customers, American companies. In what appeared to be a final push to try to take control of the government, Mr. Guaidó called for mass rallies of his supporters on April 30 and for military leaders to turn against Mr. Maduro. But by evening, the military still supported Mr. Maduro, and it was clear that the day’s uprising had failed — echoing a standoff over a cross-border aid convoy led by Mr. Guaidó in late February. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Russia for last week’s fizzle. He said officials in Moscow had urged Mr. Maduro to stay in Venezuela, even though Mr. Maduro had considered taking a plane to exile in Cuba. There has been no independent confirmation of Mr. Pompeo’s assertion. Analysts said Mr. Trump’s foreign policy team had misread the situation and had not been helpful in efforts to force out Mr. Maduro. Mr. Pence’s speech on Tuesday did not provide any new strategic vision for resolving the crisis, and instead only hesitantly put forward a new tactic of possible individual sanctions relief to officials who promise to reject Mr. Maduro. Mr. Pence also said the United States was sending the Comfort, a naval hospital ship, to Central and South America in June on a five-month mission to provide aid to Venezuelan refugees. The announcement drew tepid applause from the audience. It was not a new offer of aid: Last fall, the Comfort went on a four-month deployment to the region to help refugees. As usual when he talks publicly about Venezuela, Mr. Pence spoke entirely in English except for the few times he uttered “libertad,” Spanish for freedom. “We will continue to stand with the people of Venezuela until libertad is restored,” he said. “Nicolás Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolás Maduro must go.” Mr. Pence also criticized Iran, Russia and Cuba for helping Mr. Maduro. The remarks on Russia were in direct contrast to Mr. Trump’s pronouncements last week on Russian involvement in Venezuela. On Friday, after a phone call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters that Mr. Putin had assured him that with regard to Venezuela, Russia “is not looking at all to get involved, other than he’d like to see something positive happen.”",The New York Times
2019,White House Reassesses Auto Tariffs as It Focuses on China Fight,"WASHINGTON — The White House has decided to delay for six months a decision due Friday about whether to impose levies on foreign cars and car parts, people familiar with the situation said. Such a move would have taken aim at Japan and Europe, big auto manufacturers, and likely disrupted trade talks that the Trump administration had just begun. The decision reflects the administration’s reassessment of pieces of its tariff strategy with allies around the world as it focuses on an all-encompassing trade war with China. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said that the United States was closing in on an agreement with Mexico and Canada to roll back tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were imposed last year. If the administration does, it would end a standoff that has heightened tensions among the three countries and complicated efforts to pass the new North American Free Trade Agreement into law. “I think we’re close to an understanding with Mexico and Canada,” Mr. Mnuchin said at a Senate hearing Wednesday, although he added that he was not ready to say that the United States was lifting tariffs. “I can assure you it is a priority of ours.” Asked after the hearing about the prospect of a deal with China, Mr. Mnuchin was cautious. “I’m hopeful,” he said. “I wouldn’t say I’m confident.” The potential rollback of certain tariffs reflects the challenge of fighting trade wars on multiple fronts. Lawmakers and businesses are putting more pressure on the White House to concentrate their efforts on combating China’s unfair trade practices, while reversing far more unpopular tariffs on allies like Europe, Canada and Mexico. Yet the outcome for these tariffs is still uncertain. Mr. Trump has long been a devotee of tariffs, viewing them as an effective way to rebalance trading relationships. Political advisers and auto industry executives have emphasized that the president will make the final decision on whether to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on foreign cars. The specter of auto tariffs has hung over relations with the European Union and Japan, both major suppliers of automobiles to the United States. Canada and Mexico have negotiated a quota with the United States as part of their trade agreement that would exempt them from the measure. The president has frequently floated the idea of auto tariffs in the past, but two people familiar with the matter said that the White House had decided to delay a decision on the levies for six months, one of the president’s options under current trade law. The decision was due by Friday, but the tariffs have provoked fierce opposition among industry leaders and in Congress. In addition, the White House is now engaged in preliminary trade talks with the European Union and with Japan, and auto tariffs would throw a bomb into those negotiations. “Pleased that @POTUS has delayed decision on auto tariffs,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, tweeted Wednesday in response to media reports that the levies would not be imposed. Auto tariffs would have opened another front to Mr. Trump’s trade war, but one with much smaller potential benefits and larger political liabilities. Auto industry executives on both sides of the Atlantic are opposed to tariffs, and the duties would have inflicted collateral damage on some of his most loyal voters in states like Alabama and South Carolina, which are home to big Mercedes-Benz and BMW factories. “Our biggest market is Germany,” said Jeppe Kofod, a member of the European Parliament from Denmark. “The mere fact that Germany is hurt — we would be very much affected by that.” The 25 percent tariff on steel and the 10 percent tariff on aluminum that the Trump administration imposed last year have had a more muted economic effect, but they have done much to rattle alliances. Mexico and Canada, both of which retaliated with tariffs of their own, have previously appeared to be close to an agreement. But Mr. Trump has been hesitant to relent over his desire to protect America’s steel and aluminum sectors and his belief that the tariffs might be used as further leverage. The United States and Canada sent mixed signals Wednesday about the future of the steel and aluminum tariffs. The Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, declined to say whether the countries had struck a deal to lift those tariffs after meetings with lawmakers and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, in Washington on Wednesday. Ms. Freeland said that her conversations had been “productive” and that the two sides had been in constant contact in recent weeks. But she suggested that it would be a mistake to predict how long negotiations would last. “As has been the case from the outset, we believe that these tariffs need to be lifted,” Ms. Freeland said. Even if the president rolls back metal levies on Canada and Mexico, the current level of tariffs in the United States would remain high. The levies that Mr. Trump has put in place have given the United States a tariff rate that is twice as high as the rates imposed by Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany and France. And the overall tariff would increase greatly should Mr. Trump choose to impose measures on foreign cars. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been sharply critical of the metal tariffs, warning that the new Nafta deal would not pass until they were removed. Ms. Freeland said Wednesday that a failure to remove the tariffs could doom the deal in Canada. “As long as the tariffs are in place, ratification will be very, very problematic,” she said. The United States has been trying to persuade Canada and Mexico to agree to a quota system for steel and aluminum in exchange for rolling back the tariffs. Canada and Mexico have pushed back. It is unclear what terms the three countries are close to settling on. But Mexican officials have expressed optimism on the topic. A senior Mexican official said this week that recent talks about removing the tariffs had been “fruitful.” Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he had been pressing Mr. Trump to eliminate the metal tariffs completely. “It’s critical to the credibility of our global trade agenda,” Mr. Grassley told reporters on Tuesday. “I say the president needs to lift these tariffs.”",The New York Times
2019,"White House Reviews Military Plans Against Iran, in Echoes of Iraq War","WASHINGTON — At a meeting of President Trump’s top national security aides last Thursday, Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented an updated military plan that envisions sending as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons, administration officials said. [To follow new military deployments to the Middle East, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] The revisions were ordered by hard-liners led by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. They do not call for a land invasion of Iran, which would require vastly more troops, officials said. The development reflects the influence of Mr. Bolton, one of the administration’s most virulent Iran hawks, whose push for confrontation with Tehran was ignored more than a decade ago by President George W. Bush. It is highly uncertain whether Mr. Trump, who has sought to disentangle the United States from Afghanistan and Syria, ultimately would send so many American forces back to the Middle East. It is also unclear whether the president has been briefed on the number of troops or other details in the plans. On Monday, asked about if he was seeking regime change in Iran, Mr. Trump said: “We’ll see what happens with Iran. If they do anything, it would be a very bad mistake.” There are sharp divisions in the administration over how to respond to Iran at a time when tensions are rising about Iran’s nuclear policy and its intentions in the Middle East. Some senior American officials said the plans, even at a very preliminary stage, show how dangerous the threat from Iran has become. Others, who are urging a diplomatic resolution to the current tensions, said it amounts to a scare tactic to warn Iran against new aggressions. European allies who met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday said that they worry that tensions between Washington and Tehran could boil over, possibly inadvertently. More than a half-dozen American national security officials who have been briefed on details of the updated plans agreed to discuss them with The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. Spokesmen for Mr. Shanahan and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to comment. The size of the force involved has shocked some who have been briefed on them. The 120,000 troops would approach the size of the American force that invaded Iraq in 2003. Deploying such a robust air, land and naval force would give Tehran more targets to strike, and potentially more reason to do so, risking entangling the United States in a drawn out conflict. It also would reverse years of retrenching by the American military in the Middle East that began with President Barack Obama’s withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2011. But two of the American national security officials said Mr. Trump’s announced drawdown in December of American forces in Syria, and the diminished naval presence in the region, appear to have emboldened some leaders in Tehran and convinced the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that the United States has no appetite for a fight with Iran. Several oil tankers were reportedly attacked or sabotaged off the coast of the United Arab Emirates over the weekend, raising fears that shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf could become flash points. “It’s going to be a bad problem for Iran if something happens,” Mr. Trump said on Monday, asked about the episode. Emirati officials are investigating the apparent sabotage, and American officials suspect that Iran was involved. Several officials cautioned, however, that there is not yet any definitive evidence linking Iran or its proxies to the reported attacks. An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman called it a “regretful incident,” according to a state news agency. In Brussels, Mr. Pompeo met with the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, cosignatories of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, as well as with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini. He did not speak to the media, but the European officials said they had urged restraint upon Washington, fearing accidental escalation that could lead to conflict with Iran. “We are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident, with an escalation that is unintended really on either side,” said Jeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary. The Iranian government has not threatened violence recently, but last week, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would walk away from parts of the 2015 nuclear deal it reached with world powers. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement a year ago, but European nations have urged Iran to stick with the deal and ignore Mr. Trump’s provocations. The high-level review of the Pentagon’s plans was presented during a meeting about broader Iran policy. It was held days after what the Trump administration described, without evidence, as new intelligence indicating that Iran was mobilizing proxy groups in Iraq and Syria to attack American forces. As a precaution, the Pentagon has moved an aircraft carrier, B-52 bombers, a Patriot missile interceptor battery and more naval firepower to the gulf region. At last week’s meeting, Mr. Shanahan gave an overview of the Pentagon’s planning, then turned to General Dunford to detail various force options, officials said. The uppermost option called for deploying 120,000 troops, which would take weeks or months to complete. Among those attending Thursday’s meeting were Mr. Shanahan; Mr. Bolton; General Dunford; Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director; and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence. “The president has been clear, the United States does not seek military conflict with Iran, and he is open to talks with Iranian leadership,” Garrett Marquis, a National Security Council spokesman, said Monday in an email. “However, Iran’s default option for 40 years has been violence, and we are ready to defend U.S. personnel and interests in the region.” The reduction of forces in the Middle East in recent years has been propelled by a new focus on China, Russia and a so-called Great Powers competition. The most recent National Defense Strategy — released before Mr. Bolton joined the Trump administration — concluded that while the Middle East remains important, and Iran is a threat to American allies, the United States must do more to ensure a rising China does not upend the world order. As recently as late April, an American intelligence analysis indicated that Iran had no short-term desire to provoke a conflict. But new intelligence reports, including intercepts, imagery and other information, have since indicated that Iran was building up its proxy forces’ readiness to fight and was preparing them to attack American forces in the region. The new intelligence reports surfaced on the afternoon of May 3, Mr. Shanahan told Congress last week. On May 5, Mr. Bolton announced the first of new deployments to the Persian Gulf, including bombers and an aircraft carrier. It is not clear to American intelligence officials what changed Iran’s posture. But intelligence and Defense Department officials said American sanctions have been working better than originally expected, proving far more crippling to the Iranian economy — especially after a clampdown on all oil exports that was announced last month. Also in April, the State Department designated the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization over objections from Pentagon and intelligence officials who feared reprisals from the Iranian military. While much of the new intelligence appears to have focused on Iran readying its proxy forces, officials said they believed the most likely cause of a conflict will follow a provocative act, or outright attack, by the Revolutionary Guards’ navy. The Guards’ fleet of small boats has a history of approaching American Navy ships at high speed. Revolutionary Guards commanders have precarious control over their ill-disciplined naval forces. Part of the updated planning appears to focus on what military action the United States might take if Iran resumes its nuclear fuel production, which has been frozen under the 2015 agreement. It would be difficult for the Trump administration to make a case that the United States was under imminent nuclear peril; Iran shipped 97 percent of its fuel out of the country in 2016, and currently does not have enough to make a bomb. That could change if Iran resumes enriching uranium. But it would take a year or more to build up a significant quantity of material, and longer to fashion it into a weapon. That would allow, at least in theory, plenty of time for the United States to develop a response — like a further cutoff of oil revenues, covert action or military strikes. The previous version of the Pentagon’s war plan included a classified subset code-named Nitro Zeus, a cyberoperation that called for unplugging Iran’s major cities, its power grid and its military. The idea was to use cyberweapons to paralyze Iran in the opening hours of any conflict, in hopes that it would obviate the need to drop any bombs or conduct a traditional attack. That plan required extensive presence inside Iran’s networks — called “implants” or “beacons” — that would pave the way for injecting destabilizing malware into Iranian systems. Two officials said those plans have been constantly updated in recent years. But even a cyberattack, without dropping bombs, carries significant risk. Iran has built up a major corps of its own, one that successfully attacked financial markets in 2012, a casino in Las Vegas and a range of military targets. American intelligence officials told Congress in January that Iranian hackers are now considered sophisticated operators who are increasingly capable of striking United States targets. Since Mr. Bolton became national security adviser in April 2018, he has intensified the Trump administration’s policy of isolating and pressuring Iran. The animus against Iran’s leaders dates back at least to his days as an official in the George W. Bush administration. Later, as a private citizen, Mr. Bolton called for military strikes on Iran, as well as regime change. The newly updated plans were not the first time during the Trump administration that Mr. Bolton has sought military options to strike Iran. This year, Defense Department and senior American officials said Mr. Bolton sought similar guidance from the Pentagon last year, after Iranian-backed militants fired three mortar rounds or rockets into an empty lot on the grounds of the United States Embassy in Baghdad in September. In response to Mr. Bolton’s request, which alarmed Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, the Pentagon offered some general options, including a cross-border airstrike on an Iranian military facility that would have been mostly symbolic. But Mr. Mattis and other military leaders adamantly opposed retaliation for the Baghdad attack, successfully arguing that it was insignificant.",The New York Times
2019,Justice Dept. Threatens House Democrats Over Contempt in Barr Battle,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department threatened late Tuesday to ask President Trump to invoke executive privilege over the hidden portions of Robert S. Mueller III’s report and all of the evidence behind it if Democrats proceeded Wednesday with a vote to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, the department accused Democrats of being unreasonable in subpoenaing that material. “In the face of the committee’s threatened contempt vote, the attorney general will be compelled to request that the president invoke executive privilege with respect to the material subject to the subpoenas,” wrote Mr. Barr’s deputy, Stephen E. Boyd. “I hereby request that the committee hold the subpoena in abeyance and delay any vote on whether to recommend a citation of contempt for noncompliance with the subpoena, pending the president’s determination of this question.” [Read the Justice Department’s letter to the House committee.] The new threat came only hours after the White House stepped in to stop Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel and a key witness for Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, from handing over documents subpoenaed by House investigators because Mr. Trump may want to assert executive privilege. Democrats were enraged and said Wednesday’s vote would go on as planned because Mr. Barr was in defiance of a Judiciary Committee subpoena for the same material he was threatening to seal off. The committee also warned Mr. McGahn that if he did not show up for a public hearing this month, they would most likely hold him in contempt of Congress, too. [Update: White House asked McGahn to declare Trump never obstruced justice.] The Judiciary Committee’s chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said in a statement that the department’s argument lacked “credibility, merit or legal or factual basis.” “This is, of course, not how executive privilege works,” Mr. Nadler said. He added: “In the coming days, I expect that Congress will have no choice but to confront the behavior of this lawless administration. The committee will also take a hard look at the officials who are enabling this cover up.” Even by the standards of a week rippling with tensions between the executive and legislative branches over Democrats’ investigations, the exchanges amounted to a significant escalation of hostilities. The Justice Department’s threat raised the question of whether a privilege claim to shield material that has already been shared with investigators and disclosed to the public — and, in the case of some material redacted from the report, with lawmakers — is legitimate. Mr. Mueller’s underlying evidence, like raw reports of F.B.I. interviews with witnesses, has mostly not been viewed outside of the department, though. From a more practical view, the letter from Mr. Boyd bolstered the record that the executive branch could point to in order to make the case that Congress was unreasonable if, as seems likely, the dispute ends up in a lengthy court battle over whether Congress’s subpoena, or Mr. Trump’s for-now still hypothetical assertion of executive privilege, should prevail. Complying with the subpoena, wrote Mr. Boyd, “would force the department to risk violating court orders and rules in multiple ongoing prosecutions,” as well as require it to violate grand jury secrecy rules. The showdown between the House and White House over Congress’s constitutional role in oversight of the executive branch is also profoundly dividing the Capitol, where House Democratic leaders are getting no backup from their Senate Republican counterparts. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, stood on the floor of the upper chamber on Tuesday and pressed an entirely different verdict: “Case closed.” In a blistering speech, Mr. McConnell targeted President Barack Obama for his policy toward Russia (“maybe stronger leadership would have left the Kremlin less emboldened”) and Democrats in Congress for refusing to accept Mr. Mueller’s conclusions. “With an exhaustive investigation complete, would the country finally unify to confront the real challenges before us?” Mr. McConnell asked. “Or would we remain consumed by unhinged partisanship, and keep dividing ourselves to the point that Putin and his agents need only stand on the sidelines and watch as their job is done for them?” “Regrettably,” he continued, “the answer is obvious.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a joint statement, blasted the speech as a “stunning act of political cynicism and a brazen violation of the oath we all take.” Beyond the messaging, the divergence could shape what Democrats are able to do to further hold Mr. Trump to account for Mr. Mueller’s findings on Russian election interference and attempts by the president to thwart his investigation. Mr. McConnell’s uncompromising stand signaled that a House impeachment resolution would face a stone wall in the Senate, where Mr. Trump would be put on trial. Ms. Pelosi, in her own remarks on Tuesday, conceded that Democrats were unlikely to see a change of heart from Republicans anytime soon. Still, she argued that a pattern of obstruction of justice by the president was becoming clearer by the day. “Trump is goading us to impeach him,” she said at a Cornell University event in Manhattan. “That’s what he is doing; every single day he is just, like, taunting, taunting, taunting. Because he knows that it would be very divisive in the country. But he doesn’t really care; he just wants to solidify his base.” Ms. Pelosi said she was pushing her caucus not to take the bait, but instead to try to line up the facts and build a public case. But nearly three weeks after the release of a redacted version of Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report, that is proving more difficult than Democrats anticipated. As the Judiciary Committee received word from Mr. McGahn and the White House that he would not comply with its subpoena, committee staff members were preparing for a Wednesday morning vote on contempt for Mr. Barr. Justice Department officials and lawyers for the committee met once again on Tuesday to try to hash out a compromise to dial back the escalating tensions. They traded counteroffers, but ultimately the discussions ended acrimoniously. The Justice Department was also in a standoff with the House Intelligence Committee over a bipartisan request by its chairman and top Republican for access to all intelligence and counterintelligence information collected in the course of Mr. Mueller’s work. A committee aide indicated on Tuesday that discussions with department officials did not appear to be progressing and that the Democrat-led panel would soon turn to a subpoena. The case of Mr. McGahn, who is cited more than any other witness in the Mueller report, was narrower, but the White House actions threatened to wall off a central witness. Pat Cipollone, the current White House counsel, instructed Mr. Nadler to instead redirect such requests to the White House. “The White House provided these records to Mr. McGahn in connection with its cooperation with the special counsel’s investigation and with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes,” Mr. Cipollone wrote. “The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant executive branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.” Mr. Mueller relied heavily on Mr. McGahn in the part of his report that examined whether the president obstructed justice, using him as an unofficial narrator to recount how Mr. Trump sought to control the investigations into his campaign and administration. A Judiciary Committee subpoena had requested that Mr. McGahn turn over by Tuesday all documents and communications on more than 30 subjects, including all the major episodes that Mr. Mueller examined to determine whether the president obstructed justice. Among them were the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, attempts to fire Mr. Mueller and the president’s effort to have Mr. McGahn write a false document recanting what he told investigators. Mr. McGahn had been told by White House officials weeks ago that he should not cooperate and was frustrated that the White House stalled until the subpoena’s deadline to make its objections public, according to a person close to him. In its objection, the White House raised the specter of executive privilege, a power meant to shield conversations between the president and his closest advisers, but the president has not actually invoked that shield. Democrats seized on that point. In a letter back to Mr. McGahn’s lawyer, Mr. Nadler argued that Mr. Trump long ago lost the authority to withhold the material in question, not least because Mr. Barr disclosed much of the same material when he made most of the Mueller report public last month. Democrats appeared to be more concerned, though, about public testimony by Mr. McGahn also required by the subpoena to take place on May 21. “I fully expect that the committee will hold Mr. McGahn in contempt if he fails to appear before the committee,” Mr. Nadler wrote, “unless the White House secures a court order directing otherwise.” Mr. McGahn’s lawyer, William A. Burck, told the committee in a letter on Tuesday that in light of the White House’s position and Mr. McGahn’s continuing “duties and obligations” to the president, he would wait out potential discussions between the House and the White House. He did not specifically comment on the May 21 hearing. OpinionCarl Levin",The New York Times
2019,White Panda Is Spotted in China for the First Time,"HONG KONG — An all-white, albino panda has appeared in a natural reserve in China, the first of its kind to be documented, an expert said this week. The panda was photographed in April with an infrared camera at the Wolong National Nature Reserve in the southwestern province of Sichuan, the local authorities said in a statement. Li Sheng, who belongs to the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, said it was the first recorded image of a wild giant panda that is fully white. (There have been sightings of brown-and-white pandas in Qinling, a mountainous region in the northwestern Chinese province of Shaanxi.) The white panda’s appearance is caused by albinism, a rare genetically inherited condition that prevents the normal synthesis of melanin, resulting in white hair or pale skin, as well as reddish eyes. Giant pandas are one of eight bear species, and albinism has been recorded in many other species of bears, though rarely. “I personally think it’s quite random for it to be discovered, since albinism manifests itself so infrequently,” Dr. Li said in a telephone interview. “This was recorded just in time.” Aside from sensitivity to sunlight, albinism does not usually have a negative impact on the anatomy or life functions of animals, but their unusual appearance can make them easier to detect in the wild. “Based on the photo, albinism has not affected the life of the white panda much,” said Dr. Li, who is also a researcher at Peking University. “It looks quite well, quite strong.” Duan Zhaogang, the Communist Party secretary of the Wolong district, said in the statement that the reserve would increase its use of infrared cameras in order to track the growth and movements of the panda, which is estimated to be 1 or 2 years old, and its potential offspring. (The mutation, which comes from a recessive gene, can be passed down.) Wild pandas can be difficult to study because they mostly live alone, often in remote areas. To facilitate research, a Chinese conservation center has developed a facial recognition app that can distinguish one panda from another, the state news media said this month. Nearly 10,000 images of pandas from a database have been analyzed since 2017. There are about 1,900 giant pandas living in the wild, according to a 2016 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Citing an increase in the panda population that was credited to the Chinese government, the group changed the panda’s conservation status at that time from “endangered” to “vulnerable.” But Chinese officials opposed the move, arguing that pandas still struggle to reproduce in fragmented patches of wilderness. Also this month, a rare Asiatic black bear was caught on camera in the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South Korea. Flora and fauna thrive in the region, also known as the DMZ, because it is rarely disturbed by humans.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | White Supremacy Beyond a White Majority,"President Trump is trying to maintain white dominance as the nation’s demographics change. Opinion Columnist The white male racist patriarchy will not be denied. It is having a moment. It has its own president. According to a Pew Research Center analysis of race/ethnicity and sex among validated voters in the 2016 presidential election, white men were the only group in which a majority voted for Donald Trump — 62 percent — although a plurality of white women did also — 47 percent. We are living through a flagrant display of a white male exertion of power, authority and privilege, a demonstration meant to underscore that they will forcefully fight any momentum toward demographic displacement, no matter how inevitable the math. The fear of white male displacement is a powerful psychological motivator and keeps Trump’s base animated and active. It keeps farmers holding out hope and making excuses for him, even as his trade war devastates their operations. It keeps coal country loyal, even as the promises of a revitalized coal industry ring hollow. It keeps white voters in the rust belt on the edge of their seats, waiting for the day that he will magically bring back manufacturing. It keeps white voters in the South heated over the issue of immigration and an “invasion” or “infestation” of Latin Americans. Trump’s central promise as a politician has been the elevation, protection and promotion of whiteness, particularly white men who fear demographic changes and loss of status and privilege. As Vox reported in 2017, white people of all ideologies, including liberals, become more conservative when confronted with the reality that a rising minority population means a loss of white dominance. As the psychologist Jonathan Haidt recently told Vox: “As multiculturalism is emphasized more and more, there emerges a reaction against it on the right, which is attractive to the authoritarian mind and also appeals to other conservatives. And this, I think, is what has happened, this is what Trump is about — not entirely, of course, but certainly this is a big factor.” It is about stacking the courts, controlling the bodies of women (look no further than the raft of state abortion restrictions recently passed, including the outrageous new abortion law in Alabama), fighting the redefinition of gender as personified by the advances in liberty among people who are transgender, restricting the voting of nonwhite, less conservative groups, and controlling the flow of migrants into the country who do not bolster the white population. But the stacking of the courts may well be the thing that makes all the others possible. While much of the country tries to contend with the unending stream of outrages in the White House, the Senate majority leader is pushing through a steady stream of Trump’s far-right federal judges, often breaking precedent and allowing for their confirmations over their home state’s senators’ objection. The recent confirmation of Joseph Bianco to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based in New York, was Trump’s 38th confirmed circuit court judge, HuffPost reported last week, adding: “That’s more circuit judges than any president has gotten by this point in a first term, and means that one in every six seats on the nation’s circuit courts is now filled by a Trump nominee.” These are lifetime appointments. Even if demographics change over one’s lifetime, these judges will not. As a recent Congressional Research Service report pointed out, 90 percent of Trump’s circuit court nominees have been white and 92 percent of those confirmed have been white. Among recent presidents, only Ronald Reagan — who opposed making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a federal holiday, but eventually reversed himself, and who vetoed the Comprehensive Apartheid Act, which, with a congressional override, leveled sanctions against South Africa for its oppressive racist social architecture — appointed and confirmed a higher percentage of white judges. Eighty percent of Trump’s judicial nominees have been men, and men have been 74 percent of those confirmed. None of this can fully prevent change, but it can slow it. The strategy is to find a way to maintain white supremacy, white dominance, without the necessity of a white majority in the U.S. population. The point is that once white people become a minority in America, the country itself will move from a majority rule ideal to a minority rule one. Trump will be president for only two more years — or, God forbid, six more — but this tension and standoff over power and status will continue. At present, white men still control much of the power in this country. Frederick Douglass once said, “Power concedes nothing without a demand.” I speculate that this power may not concede until its death rattle.

2019,Whitney Houston’s Estate Plans a Hologram Tour and a New Album,"Since Whitney Houston died in 2012, her estate has been pitched every kind of entertainment deal, from jukebox musicals to a traveling museum. Pat Houston, the executor, has turned them all down. But now the estate is open for business. It has lined up an extensive list of potential projects — including a touring hologram, a possible Broadway musical, branding deals and an album of unreleased tracks — intended to awaken the commercial potential of a dormant megacelebrity brand. “Everything is about timing for me,” Pat Houston, the performer’s sister-in-law and former manager, said in an interview. “It’s been quite emotional for the past seven years. But now it’s about being strategic.” Last week, the estate signed a deal with Primary Wave Music Publishing, a boutique music and marketing company in New York, to rebuild Whitney Houston’s business. As part of the agreement, Primary Wave will acquire 50 percent of the estate’s assets, which include the singer’s royalties from music and film, merchandising, and the right to exploit her name and likeness. The deal values the estate at $14 million, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. At her peak, Ms. Houston was a pop-culture juggernaut, with a golden voice and fashion-model looks. She had 11 No. 1 hits, sold tens of millions of albums around the world, and with the blockbuster 1992 film “The Bodyguard” joined an elite category of stars with equal success in music and the movies. But to some extent, the estate is looking to resuscitate her reputation. When she died at age 48 in Beverly Hills, Calif., Ms. Houston’s career as a hitmaker was long behind her, and a public struggle with drugs had made her a tabloid fixture. A documentary last year, “Whitney,” which was authorized by the estate, looked unflinchingly at her downfall, and included the accusation that she had been molested as a child. “Before she passed, there was so much negativity around the name; it wasn’t about the music anymore,” Pat Houston said over lunch recently, before heading to Primary Wave’s office to listen to some unreleased music. “People had forgotten how great she was. They let all the personal things about her life outweigh why they fell in love with her in the first place.” As Larry Mestel, Primary Wave’s founder, put it, “Whitney was America’s sweetheart, and the idea now is to remind people that that is what her legacy is.” Mr. Mestel said he was already in discussions with Broadway producers about a musical and a Vegas-style spectacle. Unused tracks from her 1985 debut album, “Whitney Houston,” are likely to be part of a new album. To do that, the estate and Primary Wave — which specializes in marketing classic song catalogs — would need to work with Sony, which owns Ms. Houston’s recordings. The estate’s first project is the hologram, which would join a growing list of laser-generated posthumous singers who have gone on tour, including Maria Callas, Roy Orbison and Frank Zappa. The Whitney hologram, already under development, will perform hits like “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” and “The Greatest Love of All” backed by her original band and backup singers — including her brother Gary, Pat Houston’s husband. “The hologram has taken precedence over everything,” Pat Houston said. Pat Houston, the sole executor of the estate — whose beneficiaries are Whitney Houston’s mother, the gospel singer Cissy Houston, and her two brothers, Gary and Michael — has had a long association with her sister-in-law’s business, having managed her career since the early 2000s. And she knows the kinds of details that only family members were privy to: Whitney didn’t want to be on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Pat said, because “she didn’t want people walking on her name.” She also sought to correct what she called popular misconceptions about the state of Ms. Houston’s finances upon her death. “She had money when she died,” Pat Houston said. “It wasn’t multimillions, like everyone thought, but she wasn’t broke.” The agreement with the Houston estate is the latest in a series of deals by Primary Wave, which was founded in 2006 and has focused on older artists with platinum names, like Smokey Robinson, Def Leppard, Paul Anka and Kenny Loggins. It recently raised $500 million to finance new acquisitions, Mr. Mestel said. He would not disclose who the investors were, but The New York Times confirmed that they include large asset managers and at least one state pension fund. Streaming has lifted the value of classic catalogs and led to bidding wars that have pushed prices ever higher, as outside investors look to park their money in so-called alternative assets — ones, like music royalties, that don’t fit typical investment categories like equities or real estate. Primary Wave’s angle has been to promote its clients through branding and entertainment deals, many of which it develops in-house. For Bob Marley’s catalog, which it acquired last year, Primary Wave is working with the production company FiveCurrents on a live show; for Mr. Robinson, who turns 80 next year, it has a deal with Shinola for a line of Smokey Robinson-branded watches. The value, Mr. Mestel said, lies in the steady popularity of “iconic” names and songs, and he threw shade at deals that rely heavily on current hits. “I find it strange that our competitors are spending big money on relatively new song catalogs,” he said. “Their earnings will only decline as their songs come off the radio.” One of the company’s more surprising deals, in 2017, was for the estate of Glenn Gould, the Canadian classical pianist. Since his death in 1982, Gould’s catalog of Bach and other recordings has been frequently reissued and repackaged by Sony. To further promote him, Primary Wave is working on a hologram tour set to open next year — a choice that drew criticism, since Gould famously hated playing concerts. Stephen Posen, the Gould estate’s executor, said he trusted Primary Wave to handle Gould’s legacy with respect. “They were clearly empathetic of my objectives for the estate, and for holding true to Gould’s values,” he said, “and still looking to exploit and find ways of maximizing the legacy of Glenn Gould.” In her heyday, Ms. Houston sang in commercials for Diet Coke and AT&T, but mostly avoided lending her name or face to products. That may change as Primary Wave pursues new deals, but Mr. Mestel said a line had already been drawn at what was appropriate. “For Whitney Houston, who had an elegant voice and an elegant way about her, we wouldn’t do a fast-food brand relationship, for example,” he said.

Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder and chief executive officer of Bumble.CreditCreditDrew Anthony Smith for The New York Times In addition to Bumble, the dating app that requires women to make the first move, Whitney Wolfe Herd, the company’s founder and chief executive, oversees the following: an app for friends (Bumble BFF), an app for networking (Bumble Bizz), an app for gay men (Chappy), a print magazine (Bumble Mag), an investment fund (Bumble Fund), a film fund (Bumble Presents … The Female Film Force), a psychotherapeutic skin care line (Bumble Beauty), a restaurant concept (Bumble Brew), operations in nine countries, and a slew of celebrity investors and endorsers including Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams. It is, in her words, “a lot.” Complicating things is Ms. Herd’s travel schedule, which included seven countries in the first three months of the year. She bounces frequently between her two Texas homes — one in Austin, where Bumble has its headquarters, and a second about 220 miles away in Tyler, where her husband, Michael Herd, works and owns a restaurant. Since starting Bumble in 2014, Ms. Herd, 29, has defied just about every tech start-up convention. She avoided taking venture capital, and she was ahead of the curve in pushing a message of female entrepreneurial empowerment. She also leavens her image as a globe-trotting influencer — posting magazine-worthy Instagram photos of tropical vacations and celebrity weddings — with that of a girl-next-door Texan who gets Starbucks via drive-through and takes conference calls while fly-fishing. We corresponded for a week in late March. 1:30 p.m. I arrive at the Texas Capitol building to testify in support of Bill 2789, which would criminalize sending unsolicited lewd photos in the same way that indecent exposure in public is a crime. For over a year, I’ve been working behind the scenes on this bill. I am shocked at how nervous I am to testify — more so than any other public speaking I’ve done. This means a lot to me, and I know how much this can change how we treat one another online. 4:30 p.m. Before it was my turn to speak, we heard testimony from several women who were victimized by the sex trade, which was unbelievably moving and gut wrenching. They were there for a bill that would take the money seized in the sex trade and make it available for victims and survivors. It made me want to do more to raise awareness around this. 6:30 p.m. The entire day is surreal. I go for a quick cheers at our lobbyist’s headquarters with my husband and some Bumble employees. 7 p.m. My husband and I fly to Tyler and play with Duke, our 175-pound Great Dane. 5:30 a.m. I call Andrey Andreev, my founding partner and Bumble’s majority owner. He’s based in London and oversees our tech and product teams. We’re incredibly in sync and talk two to five times a day. He’s sick of hearing from me — I joke that he’s going to block my number. Daylight saving time has been great, though, because now we’re only five hours apart instead of six. 9 a.m. I finally make it out for a coffee — Starbucks drive-through — and spend the next few hours on back-to-back calls in my car. I’m driving around stores I need to stop in for errands but never actually find a moment to go in. 11:30 a.m. Call with Rachel Zoe, the fashion designer and businesswoman, from a parking lot. Our conversation is part business — talking about ways our companies could work together — and part friend catch-up. I don’t consider people to be “work acquaintances.” I treat networking the same way I treat my friends. You check in on people, see how their families are and take a real interest in them, and not because of what they can offer you. 12:30 p.m. Lunch with my husband and his grandfather. We eat at my husband’s restaurant, the Grove Kitchen and Gardens, which he opened in 2016. My husband’s grandfather is 90 and the smartest and sharpest person I know. He founded Herd Producing Company, where my husband is now president, in the 1960s. He is like our best friend and the rock of our family, so we spend a lot of time with him. 3 p.m. I catch up with the following people: a few friends via text, my mom to coordinate summer travel plans, my executive assistant on about two trillion things, my chief of staff, our chief operating officer and a few other Bumble employees. I also take a beat to Instagram my testimony and look over the rebranding for Chappy, our gay dating app. I try but fail to make it to the gym. 6 p.m. At home, Duke is so excited to see me. He is a kind animal but does not understand how big he is. At 175 pounds, he could quite literally kill me. I have to lock myself in the car while I wait for my husband to come home and get him away from me. These are my daily circumstances! 10 p.m. We fly back to Austin and have Chinese takeout with red wine for dinner. I play with my Lab, Jett, so he calms down, then try to wind myself down with a hot bath, a hot tea with magnesium, a chapter of “Educated” and 10 minutes of the Headspace app. I envy how my husband hits the pillow and goes to dreamland in less than 60 seconds. 7 a.m. Breakfast of homemade celery juice (if it works or not, who will ever know) and a bite of leftover Chinese takeout. After walking the dog, I once again attempt to work out, and once again get distracted by work. Andrey calls, and we talk through a coming safety feature, Private Detector, which identifies lewd images before they’re sent to our users and warns them. 8:30 a.m. I travel so much — seven different countries over the last three months or so — that I love the opportunity for in-person meetings with my bees (our internal term for Bumble employees). Today we’re working on our coming women’s investment summit; Serena Williams and I will be selecting the companies that participate. In another meeting, we debate the pros and cons of putting videos in Bumble’s user profiles. But after testing with users and focus groups, it turns out users don’t want it. So much goes into even the most minor launches. Sometimes you make a product decision with the best intentions and then you put it through a pilot and find out it has a negative impact. Especially with international expansion — there are intricate differences in how different cultures view love, friendship, even the term “B.F.F.” 5 p.m. My husband and I take our founding crew out for some drinks and a quick boat ride on the lake to unwind. 7 a.m. I finally get a workout in, then meet with contractors about remodeling our house. I use the drive to work to catch up with our U.K. office about European expansion. 9 a.m. Our monthly directors’ meeting is a no-nonsense session to discuss our plans and any brewing challenges. We look at our daily and monthly active users across regions and see where they’re strongest and weakest. The weeks go by really, really fast, and this is a chance for me to take a breath and hear what every group is working on. 2 p.m. Quarterly strategy with Bumble’s chief operating officer and chief of staff at a restaurant near our office. These are for making big decisions. Over four hours we discuss our new headquarters in Austin, which will have dynamic food and beverage options, a fitness center, and mental health and child care spaces. I’ll be spending a lot of time on the design. We also talk about costs and potential partners for our content project, Bumble Studios. It can be hard to find the right partners. We’ve had to pull out of several deals that would have been perfect after we found out the companies had done things that went against our values. We also get updates on our newest international markets — India, Mexico and the Philippines. We’re adding around half a million users a week, which is positive, but that also brings pressure and more responsibility. It’s a lot. 8:30 p.m. Alex Williamson, my best friend and Bumble’s chief brand officer, comes to my house for a puppy play date and some quesadillas and margaritas. 11:30 a.m. I call Emma Watson to discuss a possible partnership with her book club, Our Shared Shelf. Emma and I have known each other for a couple of years, and she’s a huge inspiration to me and everyone at Bumble. 5 p.m. I’m on calls until 7:30 p.m., including with Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s production company, where I’m on the board of directors, to discuss a few potential tie-ups. 8 p.m. A bunch of my high school friends are in town. They come over, and we cook an elaborate dinner of pasta vongole, with mussels and clams, and salad and watch “On the Basis of Sex,” the movie about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 11 a.m. I go through around 300 emails. I like to respond thoughtfully and not just give quick scrappy, sloppy half-responses from my phone. (That’s how I wind up making mistakes, like when I accidentally sent a sensitive pitch deck to the wrong people this week.) So I end up going through my inbox on the weekends. I realize that my employees might feel anxious about a ton of emails from me on a Saturday, so I store them in drafts and hit send first thing Monday morning.

2019,Who Are the ‘Characters’ That Make Your Town Interesting?,"Student Opinion Note: This is our last Student Opinion question of the 2018-19 school year. Who are the people in your school or town that make your area interesting? What makes them stand out? What role do they play in your community? In “‘I’m Weird, but I Get Results’: Have You Met This Wizard on the Subway?” Mary Pilon writes about one such character who acts as the “warlock of Brooklyn,” casting “spells” and offering wise words to New York City residents: In New York, a city where anyone can be anything, Devin Person is a self-proclaimed professional wizard. On a Sunday afternoon in his Brooklyn neighborhood, Greenpoint, Mr. Person — looking more Merlin than Harry Potter, with his plush robe and scraggly white beard — led about three dozen people in meditation. He encouraged them to “sample the flavors and energy of each cloud formation as if you were walking around Costco’s different free sample stations,” to float “like Michael Phelps diving into the pool” and to wear a smile “like the sun on the Raisin Bran box.” As a modern “wizard,” Mr. Person, 33, holds group sessions, like the recent meditation and Wizarding Hour in Greenpoint. He speaks to companies. He officiates weddings. He reads tarot and performs hypnosis. He hosts a podcast. He once planned an “edible enhanced” walkabout in Central Park. He will also show up if someone wants to “have fun hanging out with a wizard.” The article continues: “Wizards are people helpers,” he said. “They are who the hero encounters on their journey, and they’re able to give the hero a bit of advice, maybe a magical artifact, some sort of assistance that helps the hero get over their obstacle and on their journey.” Mr. Person had long been interested in the occult and spirituality when, in 2014, he decided to “hatch an egg” of something to pursue alongside his day job at the website creator Squarespace, now as an associate product manager. So, after making his way through an exhaustive list of new-age books, Mr. Person started holding “occult consulting” sessions with friends and friends of friends, eventually expanding to dozens and dozens of clients. He described his transformation as “reaching out through time and space and across the dimensional barrier to make contact with the most wizardly possibility of myself.” That meant, he said, functioning as a mentor and listener. (The word “wizard” comes from the Middle English “wys,” or “wise.”) Mr. Person posted on Facebook that he was offering coaching services. Not long after, a childhood friend from Indiana reached out. The friend, Sahil Bhatia, said he was “in a deep depression and crisis of faith.” The two men discussed strategies like “set five goals per day” that Mr. Bhatia could use to feel fulfilled. “The lower pressure and informal nature of it was much different,” Mr. Bhatia said. “That was really helpful to me.” Mr. Person stresses that he is not a therapist and that he generally offers just one session to participants, which he frames as, “This is the moment in your life where you encounter a wizard, and this has the potential to change a lot and we’re going to talk about it.” He added, “I’m weird, but I get results.” Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — What do you think about Mr. Person’s role as a “professional wizard”? If you encountered him on the street, what advice, spell or other help would you ask for? — Would you ever like to take on such a role in your town? If so, what persona would you inhabit? What would your costume look like? What kinds of services, help or advice would you offer? — Who are the “characters” that make your town interesting? Why do you find them so intriguing? — Do you think every place needs “people helpers” like Mr. Person? Why or why not? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2019,Who Deserves a Stanford Education?,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) On Wednesday my colleagues Jennifer Medina and Kate Taylor reported that prosecutors are pursuing more parents they believe may have been involved in the sweeping college admissions fraud scheme, setting wealthy parents in Southern California (and their lawyers) on edge. And later, they reported that the family of Yusi Zhao, a former Stanford student, paid $6.5 million to get her admitted as a recruited athlete. Ms. Zhao was removed from the school in April, though it’s unclear whether prosecutors are investigating Ms. Zhao or her parents. The school said at the time that it had revoked a student’s admission related to the scandal, but didn’t identify her, and had fired its sailing coach, who was charged in the fraud case. The news about Ms. Zhao’s identity — first reported by The Los Angeles Times on Wednesday — broke exactly a week after I visited the Stanford campus. Stanford is one of the most elite institutions in the world. It’s so selective that the school recently stopped publicizing its admission rate, which had dropped to 4.3 percent, in an effort to downplay its exclusivity. [Read about how more parents might be ensnared in the college admissions scandal.] So I was curious about how the students there felt about the sprawling scandal that had touched their school. When you have a pool of thousands of eminently qualified applicants, what does it mean to deserve admission to Stanford? And what should happen to students whose families paid to get in? For Jaymi McNabb, a 20-year-old freshman from Portland, hearing about the scandal was frustrating, although she knows it doesn’t represent the majority of students from wealthy families. She was raised mostly by her father, who spent her childhood working a variety of construction and other jobs. He didn’t go to college, she said, so it was mostly on her to navigate the application and financial aid process. Ms. McNabb said she wore her designation as a “FLI” student — or first-generation, low-income — proudly, and that it had been a way of building a community. The university has been supportive. Nevertheless, she said the contrast between her experiences and those of most of her peers was marked. “It’s like everything here is on a different scale than the real world,” she said. David Gonzalez and Tita Chang, both 22-year-old seniors, agreed that not much about the scandal shocked them. [Here’s a breakdown of Stanford’s undergraduate student body.] “I wasn’t surprised at all,” Ms. Chang said with a wry laugh. “I was just like, ‘Oh, they’ve finally got evidence.’” But as they chatted more, the pair came down on different sides of the nuances of the case. Mr. Gonzalez considered whether admitting applicants whose parents had made significant donations — like building a building or endowing a professorship — was different from bribery. “I think that if your parents donate a building to the school, you get in and it is also unfair,” he said. “But then it’s different because everyone at the school gets to enjoy the benefits of that bribe.” Ms. Chang, who said her parents sent her to British international schools in Thailand so she’d have a better shot at college abroad, shook her head. “That’s only perpetuating even more inequality in the school,” she said. Mr. Gonzalez’s mother, a psychologist in Miami, also went to Stanford. But he said he hadn’t thought much about himself as a legacy student. “Maybe I just haven’t interrogated that enough,” he said. “Because you actually do well,” Ms. Chang chimed in. Both said that cheating to get in — even if you didn’t know about it — should warrant expulsion. Later, I asked Stanford about its admission priorities and whether the university was re-evaluating policies like legacy admission preferences in response to the scandal. “A diverse campus community, including along economic lines, is critical to Stanford not only because we want to expand opportunity, but because we want the best environment for students to learn from each other’s diverse perspectives,” Brad Hayward, a Stanford spokesman, said. “We are continually working to learn from experience.” (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2019,Who Is Funding the A.N.C.’s Election Campaign? South Africans Are in the Dark.,"JOHANNESBURG — The “war room” for the African National Congress candidates running in local elections three years ago was an elaborate operation with new computers, wall monitors, lodging for volunteers and catered food three times a day. But the A.N.C., the party in power for the 25 years since the end of apartheid, did not fund its own war room. A South African company named Bosasa paid for everything, including the wages of the so-called volunteers, according to recent testimony at a government inquiry on corruption. Now as South Africans prepare to vote in a pivotal general election on May 8, the public does not know where the A.N.C. and the opposition parties raised the tens of millions of dollars needed to run rallies, print posters, buy television ads and perform myriad other tasks as part of their campaigns across a vast land of 57 million people. Though South Africa has long been held up as a model of democratization, revelations at the inquiry indicate that the financing of its elections appears to be riddled with the same kind of corrupt practices that have consumed the nation in recent years. Bosasa has been at the center of the ongoing government inquiry on public corruption. The company was accused by several whistle-blowers, including the former chief operating officer, of using bribes to win lucrative contracts from government officials affiliated with the A.N.C. And to keep the money flowing, it made sure the A.N.C. remained in power, in part by paying for a campaign war room. For nearly two decades, the A.N.C. and rival parties had fought efforts in the courts by advocacy groups to force them to reveal information about their private efforts. The A.N.C. has consistently denied criticism that it opposed campaign finance reform to keep its donors secret. “It’s been a huge gap, a huge weakness in our political system,” said Lawson Naidoo, executive secretary of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, an advocacy group. A recent about-face by the A.N.C. had raised hopes — prematurely, it turned out — that things might be different this year. Under pressure in the courts and from anti-corruption groups, the A.N.C. pushed through legislation mandating more transparency in election financing. But President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has been running on a campaign against corruption, delayed signing the bill by a few months — just enough time to ensure that the law would not be implemented in time for this election. What’s more, Mr. Ramaphosa himself is now under investigation for a $36,000 donation his campaign received — from Bosasa. The public protector’s office, a government anti-corruption agency, is investigating Mr. Ramaphosa on suspicion of lying in parliament about the donation from Bosasa. Initially, Mr. Ramaphosa said the money had been received by his son, Andile. The son began working as a highly paid consultant for Bosasa around the same time that Mr. Ramaphosa became president in February 2018. Mr. Ramaphosa later acknowledged that the money had been given to an attorney working for his successful campaign for the A.N.C.’s internal party election in December 2017 — a contest that was marred by widespread fraud in some provinces. Mr. Ramaphosa said he disclosed the donation as soon as he became aware of it. “No wonder the president didn’t declare this payment,” said Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the Democratic Alliance, the main opposition party. “It’s dirty money.” But advocacy groups say that both the A.N.C. and the major opposition parties have steadfastly rebuffed calls for more transparency since the early 2000s. In fact, their direct appeals to the parties to disclose the identities of their private donors voluntarily were rejected or ignored, they said. “It’s very difficult for turkeys to vote for Christmas,” said Murray Hunter, a researcher and former spokesman for Right2Know, a group that lobbies for access to information. So little is known about private donations that there have been only hints about how much parties have spent on previous campaigns. In the local elections in 2016, the A.N.C.’s head of elections disclosed that the party spent more than one billion rand, about $70 million at current exchange rates. After the staggering sum drew immediate criticism, party leaders said the figure was inaccurate but offered no further details. More recently, a provincial A.N.C. treasurer said that the party required at least 550 million rand, or more than $38 million, for its campaign leading up to the coming election. Despite their longstanding secrecy, A.N.C. leaders suddenly announced in 2017 that they would support legislation requiring the disclosure of parties’ private donors — for the good of democracy, they said. However, the A.N.C.’s about-face was much more pragmatic, according to current and former party officials and transparency groups. In 2017, the endemic corruption inside the A.N.C. was gaining attention in South Africa, especially in relation to then-president Jacob Zuma and his ties to the Gupta brothers, three businessmen from India. Party leaders acknowledged that the focus on corruption was hurting the party financially. Many of the A.N.C.’s traditional backers stopped donating because they feared being associated with the party’s corrupt practices, said Makhosi Khoza, a longtime A.N.C. leader who left the party in 2017 to form an opposition party, African Democratic Change. “The A.N.C. got used to the habit of raising funds in covert ways by selling government contracts,” Ms. Khoza said. “But then companies that had donated to the A.N.C. and benefited from state resources became scared of giving money and being exposed. “The A.N.C. got into serious financial trouble,” she said, adding that the party’s abrupt reversal in 2017 was not for the sake of greater transparency. “They were forced into it.” At the same time, a private group, My Vote Counts, successfully fought in the courts for greater transparency of private donations. The nation’s highest court ruled last June that the source of private funding must be made public. The judgment forced all parties to disclose their private donors within 18 months. “The A.N.C. wants to take credit for initiating the process in parliament,” said Zahira Grimwood, a researcher at My Vote Counts. Sure enough, when Mr. Ramaphosa signed the bill into law in February, the A.N.C. said that it had “consistently supported the principle of regulating funding for political parties,” and viewed this as “an important milestone in strengthening our democracy.” But parliament had passed the bill almost a year earlier in March 2018. Transparency groups and the former head of the public protector’s office pleaded with Mr. Ramaphosa to sign it then, but his delay meant that it would not be in effect this election. The law — which election officials now hope will be in place before the next general election scheduled for 2024 — should eventually be a “game changer” in providing more transparency about private donors, said Mr. Naidoo of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution. Others were more cautious. Disclosure will be required only for donations totaling more than 100,000 rand a year, or about $7,000 — a threshold that experts regard as too high, especially in local races. The parties will find other loopholes, advocacy groups warn. For instance, under the new law, Mr. Ramaphosa would not have been required to disclose his donation from Bosasa because it was not made directly to him, but to a campaign lawyer, Ms. Grimwood said. For this election, voters will know even less. They have, though, gleaned clues from the testimony of Bosasa’s former chief operating officer, Angelo Agrizzi, now serving as a key whistle-blower in government corruption hearings held recently. He testified that centers for troubled youths — which Bosasa had government contracts to run — were a widely tapped source of campaign funds. According to Mr. Agrizzi, the scheme worked like this: A.N.C. officials would approach Bosasa, saying they needed money for a campaign. Bosasa would then fraudulently invoice the government for old computer software at the youth centers. Once paid, Bosasa usually kept half. “The other part,” he added, “would be paid in cash to the official.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Who Is Playing Politics With the Port of Piraeus?,"An ancient Greek site finds itself caught between China and Alexis Tsipras. Contributing Opinion Writer ATHENS — Piraeus, the gritty port city that has provided Athens’s naval and commercial power throughout its tumultuous history, is the theater of a new conflict, one that pits local interests against economic development and a superpower’s global strategy. At least that’s the story that Greece’s dueling politicians are telling. Greek archaeologists have stalled an investment of more than 612 million euros offered by a Chinese-owned company seeking to revamp and expand Piraeus’s port as part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative. Early last month, Greece’s Central Archaeological Council, an advisory body, proposed declaring everything within the limits of the ancient city of Piraeus — most of which overlaps with the modern-day port and commercial center — an archaeological site. This would give archaeologists greater power to monitor construction projects and determine building designs in order to preserve archaeological finds. For its part, the Piraeus Port Authority, in which China’s state-owned Cosco Shipping holds a 51 percent stake, fears that a designation as an archaeological site could cause serious delays in its project. The Chinese embassy even got involved following the Council’s proposal, seeking assurances that the port development plans will not be derailed. Both sides are waiting for the culture minister, Myrsini Zorba, to announce whether she has accepted the proposal in full, in part, or not at all. Depending on what happens, Greece could find itself in a diplomatic dispute with its largest foreign investor at a time when the country is in desperate need of foreign investment. But this story may be more about modern Greece’s political theatrics than about the past getting in the way of the future. Digging almost anywhere in Greece will turn up traces of the past: from prehistory, the Classical Age, the Hellenistic and Roman eras, Byzantium and the Ottoman Turkish occupation. Construction of Athens’s metro system two decades ago turned into the greatest archaeological excavation the city had seen. This caused delays and added costs, but significant finds were incorporated into stations and important artifacts went to museums, providing the city and its visitors with a richer understanding of the past. Something similar is happening now as Thessaloniki, Greece’s second largest city, builds its own metro system. Piraeus, a barren peninsula, was established by the Athenians as their major port for trade and warships in the middle of the fifth century B.C. They fortified it and built walls linking it with Athens, just a few miles away. Piraeus’s original design itself is interesting. Credited to Hippodamus, the first known town planner of ancient Greece, it was organized as a grid to reflect the founders’ democratic principles. It was home to local and foreign-born merchants, as well as to the citizens who manned the warships crucial to Athens’s democracy and empire. Its planning reflected its fortunes. The Macedonian occupation in the fourth century B.C. brought economic decline, while trade during the Roman era saw recovery and the construction of new villas. In 86 B.C., the Romans sacked Athens and Piraeus, and the port was largely abandoned. But since the 19th century, it has once again played a leading role in Greece’s development. Four of the most magnificent bronze statues that have survived from ancient Greece — most likely buried to hide them from the Romans — were discovered in central Piraeus in 1959 by workers for the local water and sewage company. Since then, construction on metro and tramline extensions has revealed much about the city’s past; archaeologists and construction crews have worked closely to preserve artifacts. In fact, contracts for major projects provide a strict framework, with construction firms paying for excavations. The Piraeus Port Authority has expressed willingness to respect the past and to conserve antiquities, in accordance with the concession agreement ratified by the Greek Parliament — which includes paying €2.5 million for the ancient walls’ restoration. So what would be the point in declaring so much of Piraeus an archaeological site? And if this is so important to archaeologists, why wasn’t it done earlier? Culture Ministry officials say that if the Central Archaeological Council’s proposal is accepted, development will not stop. “All we are saying is that under this city lies the ancient city,” one of them told me. But this was never in question. Greek cities will hold mayoral elections on Sunday. Nikos Belavilas, the candidate in Piraeus from Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s left-wing Syriza party, is behind in the polls. Presenting himself as a critic of the Chinese construction project would make him appear a guardian of the city’s past — and would appeal to the left-wing voters, who are skeptical of the Chinese development project. Mr. Belavilas has been careful: He says he supports Chinese investment, but he also welcomed the proposal as “the application of the law.” He told a Greek news site, “When investors do not have the mentality of conquerors or colonialists, everything can be achieved.” The main opposition party, the center-right New Democracy, on the other hand, attributed the Council’s intervention to the government’s “ideological obsessions,” saying that these “undermine building activity in the country’s largest port.” The incumbent mayor, Yannis Moralis, said that no one knows how applying the proposal would affect life and business in the city. Mr. Tsipras was in Beijing last month for the Belt and Road Forum, where Piraeus’s port was presented as one of the projects enhancing China’s connection to the global economy. But the prime minister is a convert to this position. When Syriza came to power, in early 2015, it opposed privatization in principle, but Greece’s creditors forced it to adapt, leading to the sale of the majority stake in the port in August 2016. The Chinese company, which has run a container terminal there for nearly 10 years, says its investments have already generated jobs for more than 3,000 people and, indirectly, for another 10,000. Nearly two months after the council’s proposal, the culture minister is yet to make a decision — conveniently tying the drama around Piraeus’s development to Sunday’s mayoral and European Parliament elections. It allows Syriza to tell its voters that it fights big interests, even as it signs deals with them.

2019,"Who Is Robert F. Smith, the Man Paying Off Morehouse Graduates’ Loans?","Robert F. Smith was giving the commencement address to the graduating class of Morehouse College when he made a surprise announcement: He would be paying off the student loans of the roughly 400 graduates. It was just the latest substantial gesture from Mr. Smith, the richest black man in America, who until just a few years ago was practically unknown. Here’s what you need to know about him: ■ Mr. Smith has amassed a fortune that Forbes estimates to be worth $5 billion by founding Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that focuses on buying and selling software firms. ■ Vista has about $46 billion in assets under management, according to Forbes. The company is privately held and does not publicly report its results, but it is believed to be one of the best-performing firms in the country, with annualized returns of more than 20 percent since its founding. ■ Vista has unconventional hiring practices. Rather than seek out people with Ivy League degrees or recruit top talent from Silicon Valley, Mr. Smith looks for skilled engineers and managers from other professions who may thrive inside his companies. As part of its hiring efforts, Vista uses a personality test first developed by IBM that gauges technical and social skills, as well as a candidate’s interest in the arts and humanities. ■ Mr. Smith grew up in a mostly black, middle-class neighborhood in Denver. Both of his parents had Ph.D.s in education, and he was ambitious from an early age. He applied for an internship at Bell Labs in high school, but was told he was too young. Mr. Smith called every Monday for five months and finally got the position. [Mr. Smith’s announcement came as a surprise even to Morehouse administrators. Read more.] ■ He went to college at Cornell, studying chemical engineering, then took a job at Kraft General Foods. He got a master’s degree in business administration from Columbia, then worked at Goldman Sachs in San Francisco, advising companies including Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft. ■ Mr. Smith has a passion for music. In 2016, he was named chairman of the board of Carnegie Hall, the nation’s most prestigious concert stage. He bought and restored a storied resort, Lincoln Hills, outside Denver, where black jazz musicians like Duke Ellington once played. And he has founded programs to support music education and minority entrepreneurship in Austin, Tex., where he lives, and Chicago, where Vista has an office. ■ Mr. Smith has a flamboyant side as well. He favors three-piece suits, owns one of Elton John’s old pianos and hired John Legend and Seal — and a youth orchestra — to perform at his wedding on the Amalfi Coast. He named two of his sons, Hendrix and Legend, after Jimi Hendrix and Mr. Legend. He is married to Hope Dworaczyk, an actress and former Playboy model. ■ Though he shunned the spotlight for many years, he has recently embraced a more public role, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and making major charitable contributions. Cornell renamed its School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering after Mr. Smith, and he has made major gifts to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture and other cultural institutions. In January, Mr. Smith donated $1.5 million to Morehouse to fund student scholarships and a new park on campus.",The New York Times
2019,"Who Is Ruth Asawa, the Artist in Today’s Google Doodle?","Visitors to Google’s home page on Wednesday, the first day of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, were greeted by a doodle of several objects hanging above a woman kneeling on a mat: the Japanese-American artist Ruth Asawa. [Don’t miss an event: Subscribe to the Times Culture Calendar.] Asawa, who died at 87 in 2013, was best known for creating intricate, woven wire sculptures, many of them hanging mobiles. She lived in San Francisco and created several public fountains around the city, including one near Union Square that she completed in 1972 with the help of 200 schoolchildren. Asawa was born in Norwalk, Calif., in 1926, and during World War II was held with other members of her family in internment camps for Japanese-Americans, including one in the stables at Santa Anita Racetrack. “It was there,” Douglas Martin wrote in his obituary of Asawa, “that three animators from the Walt Disney Studios taught her to draw.” “I hold no hostilities for what happened; I blame no one,” she said in 1994. “Sometimes good comes through adversity. I would not be who I am today had it not been for the internment, and I like who I am.” Asawa’s sculptures are in the collections of several major institutions, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Later in her life, the Christie’s auction house successfully reintroduced her work to buyers, and one of her sculptures sold for $1.4 million in 2013. • The New York Times obituary of Ruth Asawa. • The legacy of Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where she studied for three years.",The New York Times
2019,Who Is Sophie Turner Without Sansa Stark? We’re About to Find Out,"With “Game of Thrones” behind her, Turner has a new movie, “Dark Phoenix,” that might make her the biggest thing to come out of Westeros. The actress Sophie Turner is part of two of the biggest pop-culture universes — three if you count the Jonas Brothers. “I hate being me in public,” she said. “I would rather be a character.”CreditCreditValerie Chiang for The New York Times After years of tragedy, upheaval and cataclysm, Winterfell is now secure and on the way to recovery in the capable hands of the new Queen in the North, Sansa Stark. But on a bright spring afternoon, the actress who plays her surveyed a new kingdom. From a high-rise hotel at the southern tip of Manhattan, Sophie Turner gazed out at the glittering harbor and beyond to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, timeworn landmarks that nevertheless retain their power to dazzle, especially during the early blushes of your honeymoon with the city. Turner relocated here from London last year, realizing a lifelong dream to live in New York — sure, that life only includes 23 years so far, but a dream’s a dream — when she moved in with the pop star Joe Jonas. At that moment in March, Jonas was still just her fiancé. “Game of Thrones” hadn’t yet debuted its divisive final season, and “Dark Phoenix,” the new “X-Men” film she leads this summer as more established stars like James McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence take a back seat, was far enough away to barely feel real. “I still feel in the bubble a bit,” she said. But things move fast when you’re 23, and even faster when you’re stepping from one of the world’s biggest pop-culture franchises into another. In the coming weeks she would marry Jonas in Vegas, march in the Technicolor peacock parade at the Met Gala, do goat yoga for Vogue, cavort with a unicorn for Harper’s Bazaar and parse the infamous “Game of Thrones” coffee cup on “The Tonight Show,” all while driving Daenerys Targaryen toward incendiary madness as Sansa on the HBO series. [Read the recap of the “Game of Thrones” series finale.] On June 7 comes “Dark Phoenix,” in which both she and her titular character, nee Jean Grey, leave comfortable cocoons to see if they might be capable of even more than they realize. For Turner that means moving on from “Thrones,” her home for most of the past decade, to find out if her own personal cache of superpowers includes the ability to carry a Marvel movie. The prospect, she admits, is terrifying. When Simon Kinberg, the writer and director of “Dark Phoenix,” first laid out the extent to which the entire movie hinges on her performance, she said, “I just [expletive] my pants right there and then.” But the thing about growing up inside an enormously magical and violent phenomenon like “Game of Thrones” is, it leaves you more or less ready for anything, showbiz-wise. Goats and unicorns are nothing compared to dragons and zombie armies. Superhero-scale productions feel like home. “Game of Thrones” was the defining pop-culture franchise of the decade. (Avengers, schmavengers.) But for a girl who grew up in a tiny English village (Chesterton, about 65 miles northwest of London) and then joined the show at 13, the cloistered production was also a haven from a world that was becoming more complicated with the fame and exposure that come from being on a hit TV show. The cast was collectively an emotional wreck as the production neared its end — “It was just a huge cry fest; the makeup artists hated us” — and in the immediate aftermath, Turner felt a spike of existential terror. “I started to think, who am I without it?” she said. “What do I do? What do I like? I don’t have an identity.” Which is understandable. But the truth is Turner is poised to become the biggest star to emerge from the show, a charismatic young celebrity whose fame and opportunities will likely only expand now that she’s not shooting “Thrones” seven months a year. At a time when pop culture is defined by universes, she’s part of two of the biggest — three if you count the Jonas Brothers. (The video for “Sucker” that she starred in with the band and her equally glamorous sister-in-law, Priyanka Chopra, has been watched more than 130 million times, nearly quadruple the total for an average episode of “Game of Thrones.”) But she’s still not entirely used to it. “I hate being me in public,” she said. “I would rather be a character.” She’s known for trolling the paparazzi, and you can glimpse something of her personality in the photos of her making odd faces with Joe Jonas or aiming her own camera at the photographers — the wry playfulness, mixed with a self-protectiveness that won’t quite let her just ignore them and move on. In person she is funny and easygoing, and frank about her past struggles with depression and feelings of insecurity. “When I’m on set, I feel great,” she said. “I feel very happy. But then after the fact — that’s when the anxiety kicks in.” The notion is hard to square with the statuesque actress sitting in front of you, reclining comfortably and casually swigging from a bottle of green tea, a tattoo of a Stark wolf and a line from the show (“The Pack Survives”) visible on her arm. But it’s this combination of easy confidence and vulnerability that made Sansa’s extreme trajectory over eight seasons, from callow neophyte to commanding leader, seem believable. It’s the same quality that made Kinberg want her for Jean Grey, an emotionally delicate hero with more power than she knows how to handle. “She is this 5-foot-9-inch extraordinary-looking human who also feels as insecure and broken as the rest of us,” he said of Turner. The period after “Thrones” ended was “a big healing time for me,” she said, and she spent it doing as little as possible. When we talked at the end of that stretch, she was as curious as anyone to see how the next few months would go, even as she allowed that it was nerve-racking to have the film coming so closely behind “Game of Thrones,” given the scrutiny each — and by extension, she — would receive. As of Sunday the first half of the equation has been settled and … let’s say the reviews were mixed. Less for Turner, whose Sansa was a bright spot in the final episodes, than for the loudly loathed season itself. On most Monday mornings Twitter felt like a Bellagio fountain of #GameofThrones haterade, and more than 1 million people signed a symbolic petition to have the final season remade. “People always have an idea in their heads of how they want a show to finish, and so when it doesn’t go to their liking they start to speak up about it and rebel,” she said in a phone conversation the morning after the finale. (She hadn’t yet seen the episode herself, “because I was alone when it came out, and I truly can’t be alone to watch it.”) She added, “All of these petitions and things like that — I think it’s disrespectful to the crew, and the writers, and the filmmakers who have worked tirelessly over 10 years, and for 11 months shooting the last season.” [These are the summer movies you should see.] But unlike many associated with the show, Turner has dealt with fan scorn from the beginning. People hated Sansa in the early days — dimwittedly so, generally, given that she was by design besotted with the medieval fantasy tropes that the show aimed to shatter. “A few people didn’t understand that she was a brilliant actress, merely because she was doing things they didn’t like,” the creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff wrote in a joint email. But “we knew that as the character came into her own, and as Sophie came into her own, people would come to see them both for what they are.” Which happened, eventually. Over the years Sansa was the avatar for the show’s best and worst impulses. The once immature girl with romantic dreams of wearing a crown ultimately got there by becoming savvy and strong, one of several nuanced, exceedingly capable women in a story whose men, by the end, were mostly dunces. She was also run through the wringer, to the point that, after Sansa was raped on her wedding night in Season 5, Turner found herself at the center of a national outcry over the show’s use of sexual violence. Then this past season, the writers had the nerve to have Sansa seem to credit the abuse with making her strong. “I don’t think that was the intention,” she said. “It was that she was strong in spite of all of the horrific things that she’s gone through, not because of them.” But no matter what she was going through onscreen, she said, it was often easier than the experience of growing up in public. Turner is, by any conceivable definition, beautiful. But she was also, not so long ago, a 16-year-old girl being bombarded with her own image at a time when her image was often the last thing she wanted to see. She leaned hard on her onscreen sister, Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), the one other girl in the world who understood what it was like to grow up inside “Game of Thrones.” “To go home at the end of the day, if I felt really fat that day or if I felt like my face looked weird or I had huge zits, to be able to go home to the hotel room and sit there and cry with Maisie — it was the best thing for us,” Turner said. “I’m glad I wasn’t crying on my own.” To make things worse, the social media hordes picked her apart — punishing Turner for Sansa’s perceived sins as much as anything — and she was feeling very much like the inexperienced actor she was. “As everyone could tell in Season 1, I was a terrible actress,” she said, with a matter-of-factness that’s a little heartbreaking if you think of a teenager who, much like Sansa, was strapped into a corset in an unfamiliar country, feeling like she was doing a lousy job. On set she was known for a breezy professionalism that belied her youth. But she struggled with bouts of anxiety and depression, which she’s learned to manage through therapy. She also took comfort in Sansa — even as the poor girl was being put through an ever more baroque series of horrors, Turner often found it a more comfortable space to occupy than her own skin. She says now that she admires Sansa, specifically the way she learned to work the angles and thrive in a tough situation. In a way, Turner did, too. Thrust into a slightly overwhelming situation, she watched and she learned. She learned how to be an actor by observing Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey, she said, especially their naturalism and the way they could enter a room and immediately make it their own. But whatever her self-criticisms, her talent was apparent from the start. Dinklage, who as Tyrion Lannister shared many early scenes with her as well as some of the best moments in the final season, said Turner “has a beautiful stillness to her as an actor that’s incredibly rare.” “From the start as a very young girl she had such discipline,” he wrote in an email. “One minute she could be dancing and singing a musical number and the instant they are camera ready she can flip the switch and dig so deep emotionally. That’s a gift.” Turner brought Kinberg to tears with her audition for 2016’s “X-Men: Apocalypse,” in which Jean Grey was more of a supporting character. But in “Dark Phoenix” she’s the center of the story. The film broadly retraces the contours of 2006’s “X-Men: The Last Stand,” the not-very-good conclusion of the first generation of X-Men films. Kinberg, who also wrote that one, acknowledges now that even though it was technically mostly the story of Jean Grey, then played by Famke Janssen, she spent most of her time “being saved by dudes.” “Dark Phoenix” is different, and is largely about the phenomenally powerful Jean Grey rejecting the corner she’s been put into by Charles Xavier (McAvoy) in favor of embracing her own agency, with the help of a mentoring alien played by Jessica Chastain. If you surmise that this plot would give “Dark Phoenix” a feminist subtext, you’d be wrong — it’s pretty much the entire text. (“We should be called the X-Women,” Lawrence’s character Mystique says at one point.) The real-world parallels are unmissable, within both the larger cultural narrative about women rejecting society’s constraints and Turner’s personal one. Chastain was struck by Turner’s poise when she met her before shooting began. But she also sensed the uncertainty of an actor transitioning into a higher-profile phase of her career. “There was this idea of like, What am I allowed to do? What am I allowed to say? Who am I allowed to be?” Chastain said. “It’s really exciting for me to see Soph understand that everything that’s happening to her is because of her — she created this.” For Turner, her trajectory is not unlike that of any young adult stepping out into the world. “It feels like ‘Game of Thrones’ was secondary school; now ‘X-Men’ is university,” she said. Her “Thrones” pack scattered to the winds, Turner has created a new one with Jonas, whom she married earlier this month in a surprise ceremony in Las Vegas. (They had been engaged since 2017.) An Elvis impersonator presided; Diplo posted video to Instagram. “I take a lot of inspiration from him,” she said of Jonas. “He went through a breakup with his band, who are also his brothers, and that’s got to be really, really difficult. For him to have a wonderful family life and wonderful relationships with his brothers, and still turn out to be a very grounded normal person, is astounding to me.” The band is back on tour this summer, and together the couples form an extraordinarily attractive and talented group of young people doing young people things — hitting the slopes in Switzerland, pouring body shots upon gobsmacked Penn State students. But to Turner, there’s nothing extraordinary about it. “It just feels normal to us,” she said. The paparazzi, she insists, are only there for Jonas. “I’m just like a tag-along,” she said, which is patently ridiculous. But the upshot is that even now, even in New York, she’s still bombarded with her image more than she’d like. “Social media just sucks,” she said. Yes, it’s pretty terrible, I tell her. So how did you and Joe meet, anyway? “Instagram,” she said, and then laughed hard and genuinely at the irony as well as, perhaps, what it suggested about the interwoven nature of young fame and multiplatform consumption. “So it doesn’t suck that much.”",The New York Times

2019,Who Might Replace Theresa May as Britain’s Prime Minister? The Field Grows,"LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has announced that she will step down as the Conservative Party leader on June 7, bringing into the open a party leadership struggle that has been underway on the sidelines for months. But deep divisions within the party and the nation over Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union proved fatal to Mrs. May’s leadership, and it is not clear that a successor would fare any better. The race is already shaping up to be a crowded one, with near daily announcements from Conservative Party lawmakers throwing their hats into the ring. Anyone seeking the job has to be nominated by two members of Parliament. If there is only one candidate, he or she automatically becomes the new leader. If there are more than two, lawmakers vote among themselves to narrow the field to two candidates, who then are put to a vote by the 120,000 mostly white, mostly aging Conservative Party members. The party said it expected to begin the nomination process in the week of June 10, after Mrs. May steps aside, and to complete the process by the end of July. By Wednesday, 11 candidates had declared their intention to run to succeed the prime minister. Others had yet to make a public announcement. Here are the potential successors seen as having the best chance to become head of the Conservative Party and, eventually, prime minister. Mr. Johnson, 54, the former foreign secretary and one of the most outspoken critics of Mrs. May’s Brexit plan, is one of the most polarizing figures in British politics but seen by some hard-line Brexit supporters as a good choice. He was a figurehead in the campaign to leave the European Union, and since the 2016 referendum has pushed for a hard split with the bloc. This stance regularly put him at odds with Mrs. May as she fought for a deal that would, supposedly temporarily, maintain relatively closer ties to Europe, and he regularly undermined her efforts to sell her deal to Parliament. On Friday, that history seemed distant immediately after Mrs. May’s announcement. In a statement posted on Twitter, he thanked Mrs. May for her “stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party” and urged lawmakers to heed her call to deliver Brexit. Mr. Johnson first gained notoriety for his bombastic displays as mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, before returning to Parliament. He was one of the most prominent voices of the Leave campaign that urged Britain to vote for the country’s exit from the European Union, and since the 2016 referendum has advocated a hard split. Mr. Johnson served as foreign secretary in Mrs. May’s cabinet, but resigned in 2018 in protest over her withdrawal strategy. Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Raab has long advocated a sharp severing of ties with Europe. At 45, he is seen by some in the party as a youthful face who could redefine the leadership role, and he announced his intention to run on Sunday. He served for a short time as Brexit secretary. But he resigned unexpectedly in 2018. At the time, he said he was unable to “reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made,” exposing a deep rift within Mrs. May’s cabinet. Ms. Leadsom, 56, has put herself forward for the party leadership before — in May 2016, she went up against Mrs. May after Prime Minister David Cameron stepped down in the wake of the referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union. She unexpectedly dropped out before the issue was put to a vote, after her chances were damaged by comments she made in an interview with The Times of London in which she suggested that she was a better candidate for the premiership because she is a mother, unlike Mrs. May. This week, she resigned as the leader of the House of Commons, seemingly taking steps to distance herself from the failing leadership. She has been a vocal supporter of a clean break with the European Union. Mr. Gove, 51, the environment secretary, formerly served as justice secretary and education secretary, and is seen by some as a front-runner for the leadership role. Before the 2016 referendum, he campaigned for Britain’s exit, and he has largely backed the prime minister’s strategy during her time in office. He was vocal in his support for Mrs. May, and urged others within his party to support her deal in several iterations. Mr. Gove proved an unlikely ally after he lost to Mrs. May in his bid to succeed Mr. Cameron. When Mr. Gove offered himself up as a reluctant candidate in that leadership race, he very clearly acknowledged what he called his “limitations.” “Whatever charisma is, I don’t have it,” Mr. Gove said at the time. “Whatever glamour may be, I don’t think anyone could ever associate me with it.” Mr. Hunt, 52, replaced Mr. Johnson as foreign secretary, having served as health secretary for the previous six years. Like Mrs. May, Mr. Hunt voted for Britain to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum. But in the years since, Mr. Hunt has become a supporter of the decision to leave, citing the “arrogant” and “disappointing” tactics of the bloc’s negotiating team. He was a vocal supporter of Mrs. May’s initial withdrawal deal, though on Thursday he withdrew his support for her “last chance deal” introduced this week. On Friday, he paid tribute to her service, calling her a “true public servant” in a tweet. Mr. Javid, 49, the home secretary, once supported remaining in the European Union but has since thrown his support behind the efforts to leave. On Monday, he announced his intention to run for the head of the party. The son of immigrants from Pakistan, Mr. Javid was a successful banker before turning to politics. Mr. Javid has been positioning himself for a potential leadership role since early this year, making waves with the decision to strip the citizenship of Shamima Begum, the British teenager who traveled to Syria in 2015 to join the Islamic State. But some, including fellow Tory lawmakers, criticized him for the move, calling it opportunistic. Mr. Lidington, 62, supported the campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union, and as Mrs. May’s de facto deputy is seen by some as her natural successor. When speculation arose last year about a possible coup within her cabinet, some tabloids pointed to Mr. Lidington as the most likely next in line. But others believe his prospects are slim. He has long expressed admiration for Mrs. May and worked to rally support for her unpopular Brexit deal, but has said his position has given him a unique view of the difficult nature of the premiership. “One thing that working closely with the prime minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task,” he told The Guardian. Mr. Hancock, 40, the health secretary, supported remaining in the European Union, and he has since been a staunch opponent of a no-deal exit from the bloc. He vowed when he entered the race on Saturday to deliver Brexit should he become the next prime minister, but added that his focus would be not just on Brexit, but also on free enterprise and a free society. A graduate of Oxford, Mr. Hancock worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as chief of staff to the lawmaker who speaks for the opposition on economic and financial matters. He became a member of Parliament himself in 2010. Damian Green, a former secretary of state, said in The Sunday Times that only Mr. Hancock had the common sense to heal Britain’s wounds. Ms. McVey, 51, the former secretary of state for work and pensions, voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, and she has recently come out in support of a no-deal Brexit. “The Withdrawal Agreement ship has sailed and needs to be put out of its misery,” she said in a Twitter post on Sunday. “I will take the bold and positive new approach the country needs: leave the EU on October 31 with a clean break so we can all move on & rebuild a UK that works for everyone.” She also said that she would increase school and police funding, while reducing foreign spending. “I’m standing on a blue-collar Conservative platform,” she said. Ms. McVey has previously come under fire for a controversial speech on the rise of food banks, and for voting against same-sex marriage. Mr. Stewart, the secretary of state for international development, has been gaining ground as a measured, moderate Conservative candidate, especially after a certain declaration on Saturday. “I’m afraid I would not be able to serve in a Boris Johnson cabinet,” he told Sky News, on the basis that Mr. Johnson “will try to crash” Britain out of the European Union. He followed this up with a Twitter post that many saw as a jibe against Mr. Johnson, the front-runner in the race to succeed Mrs. May. Mr. Stewart, 46, was a Labour supporter in his teens, and served as a diplomat in the Middle East before entering Parliament in 2010. He was one of the more vocal supporters of Mrs. May’s compromise Brexit deal. “I just think although people pretend they want a Brexit deal, it turns out that far too many Remainers simply do not want to accept the result of the referendum and far too many Brexiteers have convinced themselves that no deal is the sensible, practicable thing to do and I don’t think it is,” he told the political magazine The Spectator last month. Mr. Cleverly, 49, has been a member of Parliament since 2015, making him a relative newcomer to national politics. He put himself forward for the leadership role on Wednesday with an open letter to voters in his district. “To inspire the British people we need to look different, sound different, and offer something new,” he wrote. “I believe I can do that.” Shortly after announcing his candidacy, Mr. Cleverly told BBC Radio he would prefer to come to an agreement for a deal on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, but that a no-deal Brexit was not out of the question. “Not delivering Brexit would be significantly more damaging” for the Conservative Party and the country at large than leaving without a deal, he asserted. Mr. Malthouse, 52, entered Parliament in 2015. He is the minister of state for housing, and is seen by many as a rising star within the government. He also brokered the “Malthouse compromise” Brexit plan, which attempted to unite Conservative Remainers and Brexiteers behind Mrs. May’s deal by promising to rewrite provisions relating to the Northern Ireland border, a prospect the European Union has repeatedly ruled out. “We have to unify around a Brexit plan that will get us out on Oct. 31,” Mr. Malthouse told the BBC. “I deal with people honestly and fairly.” Mr. Harper, who was first elected as a member of Parliament in 2005, has served in numerous posts in Britain’s cabinet, including government chief whip and minister for disabled people. But he came under fire during his tenure as the immigration minister that lasted from 2012 to 2014 for being behind the government’s controversial “Go Home” campaign buses, which urged undocumented immigrants to leave Britain or face arrest. Mr. Harper was against Britain’s exit from the European Union, but he has since pledged to deliver Brexit and “honor the decision that the British people took in 2016 to leave the EU,” he wrote in his website. “I am not prepared to see our democracy damaged.” Mr. Gyimah entered Parliament for the first time in 2010, and was previously a minister for various fiels, including universities, prisons and child care. He announced his candidacy with a rare pledge for a Conservative: to hold a second referendum. Mr. Gyimah resigned from Mrs. May’s cabinet in November, after he declared he would not back the government’s proposed withdrawal agreement with the European Union. He said he decided to run for party leader and prime minister to broaden the race. “There is a wide range of candidates, but there is a narrow set of views on Brexit being discussed,” he told Sky News on Sunday. “Parliament is deadlocked,” he said. “We want to be able to bring the country together,” adding that the people’s final say on the Brexit deal would unite Britain.",The New York Times
2019,Who Might Replace Theresa May as Britain’s Prime Minister? The Field Grows,"LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has announced that she will step down as the Conservative Party leader on June 7, bringing into the open a party leadership struggle that has been underway on the sidelines for months. But deep divisions within the party and the nation over Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union proved fatal to Mrs. May’s leadership, and it is not clear that a successor would fare any better. The race is already shaping up to be a crowded one, with near daily announcements from Conservative Party lawmakers throwing their hats into the ring. Anyone seeking the job has to be nominated by two members of Parliament. If there is only one candidate, he or she automatically becomes the new leader. If there are more than two, lawmakers vote among themselves to narrow the field to two candidates, who then are put to a vote by the 120,000 mostly white, mostly aging Conservative Party members. The party said it expected to begin the nomination process in the week of June 10, after Mrs. May steps aside, and to complete the process by the end of July. By Wednesday, 11 candidates had declared their intention to run to succeed the prime minister. Others had yet to make a public announcement. Here are the potential successors seen as having the best chance to become head of the Conservative Party and, eventually, prime minister. Mr. Johnson, 54, the former foreign secretary and one of the most outspoken critics of Mrs. May’s Brexit plan, is one of the most polarizing figures in British politics but seen by some hard-line Brexit supporters as a good choice. He was a figurehead in the campaign to leave the European Union, and since the 2016 referendum has pushed for a hard split with the bloc. This stance regularly put him at odds with Mrs. May as she fought for a deal that would, supposedly temporarily, maintain relatively closer ties to Europe, and he regularly undermined her efforts to sell her deal to Parliament. On Friday, that history seemed distant immediately after Mrs. May’s announcement. In a statement posted on Twitter, he thanked Mrs. May for her “stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party” and urged lawmakers to heed her call to deliver Brexit. Mr. Johnson first gained notoriety for his bombastic displays as mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, before returning to Parliament. He was one of the most prominent voices of the Leave campaign that urged Britain to vote for the country’s exit from the European Union, and since the 2016 referendum has advocated a hard split. Mr. Johnson served as foreign secretary in Mrs. May’s cabinet, but resigned in 2018 in protest over her withdrawal strategy. Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Raab has long advocated a sharp severing of ties with Europe. At 45, he is seen by some in the party as a youthful face who could redefine the leadership role, and he announced his intention to run on Sunday. He served for a short time as Brexit secretary. But he resigned unexpectedly in 2018. At the time, he said he was unable to “reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made,” exposing a deep rift within Mrs. May’s cabinet. Ms. Leadsom, 56, has put herself forward for the party leadership before — in May 2016, she went up against Mrs. May after Prime Minister David Cameron stepped down in the wake of the referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union. She unexpectedly dropped out before the issue was put to a vote, after her chances were damaged by comments she made in an interview with The Times of London in which she suggested that she was a better candidate for the premiership because she is a mother, unlike Mrs. May. This week, she resigned as the leader of the House of Commons, seemingly taking steps to distance herself from the failing leadership. She has been a vocal supporter of a clean break with the European Union. Mr. Gove, 51, the environment secretary, formerly served as justice secretary and education secretary, and is seen by some as a front-runner for the leadership role. Before the 2016 referendum, he campaigned for Britain’s exit, and he has largely backed the prime minister’s strategy during her time in office. He was vocal in his support for Mrs. May, and urged others within his party to support her deal in several iterations. Mr. Gove proved an unlikely ally after he lost to Mrs. May in his bid to succeed Mr. Cameron. When Mr. Gove offered himself up as a reluctant candidate in that leadership race, he very clearly acknowledged what he called his “limitations.” “Whatever charisma is, I don’t have it,” Mr. Gove said at the time. “Whatever glamour may be, I don’t think anyone could ever associate me with it.” Mr. Hunt, 52, replaced Mr. Johnson as foreign secretary, having served as health secretary for the previous six years. Like Mrs. May, Mr. Hunt voted for Britain to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum. But in the years since, Mr. Hunt has become a supporter of the decision to leave, citing the “arrogant” and “disappointing” tactics of the bloc’s negotiating team. He was a vocal supporter of Mrs. May’s initial withdrawal deal, though on Thursday he withdrew his support for her “last chance deal” introduced this week. On Friday, he paid tribute to her service, calling her a “true public servant” in a tweet. Mr. Javid, 49, the home secretary, once supported remaining in the European Union but has since thrown his support behind the efforts to leave. On Monday, he announced his intention to run for the head of the party. The son of immigrants from Pakistan, Mr. Javid was a successful banker before turning to politics. Mr. Javid has been positioning himself for a potential leadership role since early this year, making waves with the decision to strip the citizenship of Shamima Begum, the British teenager who traveled to Syria in 2015 to join the Islamic State. But some, including fellow Tory lawmakers, criticized him for the move, calling it opportunistic. Mr. Lidington, 62, supported the campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union, and as Mrs. May’s de facto deputy is seen by some as her natural successor. When speculation arose last year about a possible coup within her cabinet, some tabloids pointed to Mr. Lidington as the most likely next in line. But others believe his prospects are slim. He has long expressed admiration for Mrs. May and worked to rally support for her unpopular Brexit deal, but has said his position has given him a unique view of the difficult nature of the premiership. “One thing that working closely with the prime minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task,” he told The Guardian. Mr. Hancock, 40, the health secretary, supported remaining in the European Union, and he has since been a staunch opponent of a no-deal exit from the bloc. He vowed when he entered the race on Saturday to deliver Brexit should he become the next prime minister, but added that his focus would be not just on Brexit, but also on free enterprise and a free society. A graduate of Oxford, Mr. Hancock worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as chief of staff to the lawmaker who speaks for the opposition on economic and financial matters. He became a member of Parliament himself in 2010. Damian Green, a former secretary of state, said in The Sunday Times that only Mr. Hancock had the common sense to heal Britain’s wounds. Ms. McVey, 51, the former secretary of state for work and pensions, voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, and she has recently come out in support of a no-deal Brexit. “The Withdrawal Agreement ship has sailed and needs to be put out of its misery,” she said in a Twitter post on Sunday. “I will take the bold and positive new approach the country needs: leave the EU on October 31 with a clean break so we can all move on & rebuild a UK that works for everyone.” She also said that she would increase school and police funding, while reducing foreign spending. “I’m standing on a blue-collar Conservative platform,” she said. Ms. McVey has previously come under fire for a controversial speech on the rise of food banks, and for voting against same-sex marriage. Mr. Stewart, the secretary of state for international development, has been gaining ground as a measured, moderate Conservative candidate, especially after a certain declaration on Saturday. “I’m afraid I would not be able to serve in a Boris Johnson cabinet,” he told Sky News, on the basis that Mr. Johnson “will try to crash” Britain out of the European Union. He followed this up with a Twitter post that many saw as a jibe against Mr. Johnson, the front-runner in the race to succeed Mrs. May. Mr. Stewart, 46, was a Labour supporter in his teens, and served as a diplomat in the Middle East before entering Parliament in 2010. He was one of the more vocal supporters of Mrs. May’s compromise Brexit deal. “I just think although people pretend they want a Brexit deal, it turns out that far too many Remainers simply do not want to accept the result of the referendum and far too many Brexiteers have convinced themselves that no deal is the sensible, practicable thing to do and I don’t think it is,” he told the political magazine The Spectator last month. Mr. Cleverly, 49, has been a member of Parliament since 2015, making him a relative newcomer to national politics. He put himself forward for the leadership role on Wednesday with an open letter to voters in his district. “To inspire the British people we need to look different, sound different, and offer something new,” he wrote. “I believe I can do that.” Shortly after announcing his candidacy, Mr. Cleverly told BBC Radio he would prefer to come to an agreement for a deal on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, but that a no-deal Brexit was not out of the question. “Not delivering Brexit would be significantly more damaging” for the Conservative Party and the country at large than leaving without a deal, he asserted. Mr. Malthouse, 52, entered Parliament in 2015. He is the minister of state for housing, and is seen by many as a rising star within the government. He also brokered the “Malthouse compromise” Brexit plan, which attempted to unite Conservative Remainers and Brexiteers behind Mrs. May’s deal by promising to rewrite provisions relating to the Northern Ireland border, a prospect the European Union has repeatedly ruled out. “We have to unify around a Brexit plan that will get us out on Oct. 31,” Mr. Malthouse told the BBC. “I deal with people honestly and fairly.” Mr. Harper, who was first elected as a member of Parliament in 2005, has served in numerous posts in Britain’s cabinet, including government chief whip and minister for disabled people. But he came under fire during his tenure as the immigration minister that lasted from 2012 to 2014 for being behind the government’s controversial “Go Home” campaign buses, which urged undocumented immigrants to leave Britain or face arrest. Mr. Harper was against Britain’s exit from the European Union, but he has since pledged to deliver Brexit and “honor the decision that the British people took in 2016 to leave the EU,” he wrote in his website. “I am not prepared to see our democracy damaged.” Mr. Gyimah entered Parliament for the first time in 2010, and was previously a minister for various fiels, including universities, prisons and child care. He announced his candidacy with a rare pledge for a Conservative: to hold a second referendum. Mr. Gyimah resigned from Mrs. May’s cabinet in November, after he declared he would not back the government’s proposed withdrawal agreement with the European Union. He said he decided to run for party leader and prime minister to broaden the race. “There is a wide range of candidates, but there is a narrow set of views on Brexit being discussed,” he told Sky News on Sunday. “Parliament is deadlocked,” he said. “We want to be able to bring the country together,” adding that the people’s final say on the Brexit deal would unite Britain.",The New York Times
2019,Who Runs New York When the Mayor Campaigns for President?,"Now that Bill de Blasio has announced he’s running for president, what happens when he leaves to campaign? [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Mayor Bill de Blasio has not always had the best luck with his travels out of town. There was the trip to Germany in July 2017, when the mayor joined protest events around the Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg. The trip’s timing — a day after the ambush killing of a city police officer in the Bronx — brought him heavy criticism. In February, Mr. de Blasio had to cancel a trip to New Hampshire, an early primary state, when a New York Police Department detective was killed in the line of duty. And in 2015, Mr. de Blasio was just returning from a trip to the Vatican when the city reversed itself on a highly watched decision to place a cap on the number of for-hire vehicles. The move was seen by some as a cave-in to Uber, which had launched an aggressive campaign targeting the mayor. With the mayor still in transit, Anthony Shorris, then Mr. de Blasio’s first deputy mayor, was quoted in news accounts about the incident. Mr. de Blasio, who on Thursday announced his entry in the 2020 presidential race, is hardly the first mayor in New York with his sights trained outside the city. John V. Lindsay, like Mr. de Blasio, sought the Democratic nomination for president. Michael R. Bloomberg was known for taking regular jaunts to his estate in Bermuda, including one trip that backfired when a particularly bad snowstorm hit New York. Mr. Bloomberg had to fly his private plane back to the city. For any major public official, leaving town always carries the risk that something eventful might happen during the absence. Now, as Mr. de Blasio runs for president, that risk is about to be magnified — along with the question of who is in charge while the mayor is away. According to the City Charter, the mayor can designate a deputy mayor to officially be in charge when he is out of town. “There’s a hierarchy. It’s first deputy mayor, of course, first, and then it goes through other deputy mayors,” Mr. de Blasio said in a recent interview. “There’s usually a stipulated order and the chief of staff as well. So, there’s always one of the deputy mayors in charge.” Dean Fuleihan is Mr. de Blasio’s first deputy mayor. When the mayor is out of town, Mr. Fuleihan is assigned his own security detail and becomes the de facto mayor. If there is an incident that called for the mayor to show up to in person, Mr. Fuleihan would go. Mr. Fuleihan, whom the de Blasio administration declined to make available for an interview, also consults with Mr. de Blasio’s chief of staff, Emma Wolfe, but city officials insisted that Mr. de Blasio essentially remained in charge. “He is on his phone and email, regularly connecting with deputy mayors and commissioners, ensuring the work of the administration continues,” Freddi Goldstein, Mr. de Blasio’s press secretary, said of the mayor. But when Mr. de Blasio took a family vacation to Italy in 2014 that was almost 10 days long, his ability to keep tabs on the city was questioned by one of his predecessors, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. “It isn’t true that you can run the city from far away,” Mr. Giuliani said. When Mr. de Blasio went to Italy with his family, his vacation spanned parts of 10 days. But the mayor’s staff pointed out that Mr. de Blasio would be out of the city just shy of nine days. Why does that matter? According to the City Charter, if a mayor is absent or unable to perform his duties for nine consecutive days, the public advocate assumes the duties of mayor. In 2014, Letitia James, then the public advocate, had lawyers on her staff research the executive powers she would have while Mr. de Blasio was away. The current public advocate, Jumaane D. Williams, has said he’s not interested in running for mayor in 2021, when Mr. de Blasio’s second and last term expires, but he remains ready to fill in if necessary. “I ran to be public advocate because that’s the job I want,” Mr. Williams said in a statement. “As I said on the campaign trail, I’m ready to fulfill the charter mandate if and when necessary.” Mr. Lindsay was campaigning in Miami Beach in 1972 when a plane flew overhead with a banner that read: “LINDSAY SPELLS TSOURIS,” using a Yiddish word for trouble. The banner, purchased by Robert B. Blaikie, a well-known gadfly who was unhappy with the mayor, was a visible example of how New York-style disgruntlement can follow an unfavorite son. Sid Davidoff, who was Mr. Lindsay's deputy campaign manager and is a supporter of Mr. de Blasio's, said Mr. Lindsay chose to focus on Florida because there were a lot of former New Yorkers there who knew him. The banner, he said, was a reminder that “you also had people who were in Florida because they didn't like Lindsay.” “You can talk about your accomplishments, but you also take your negatives on the road,” Mr. Davidoff added. As Mr. de Blasio visited ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Thursday to discuss his presidential campaign launch, labor unions and other protesters waited outside, holding signs criticizing Mr. de Blasio on everything from labor practices to his housing policies. “When you are the mayor of New York City you bring media celebrity, but also those who don’t like you,” said Bruce Gyory, an adjunct professor of political science at the University at Albany. “New Yorkers don’t tend to be quiet or shy, and they can play to the New York media and the national media.” In December 2017, Mr. de Blasio got an early taste of what may lie ahead. He traveled to Iowa to speak at a Democratic fund-raiser, shortly after acknowledging his intention to create a federal political action committee that he has since used for his travels. A gaggle of police officers, sent by their union, was there to greet him, waving signs in protest. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch was visiting Ireland in 1988 when a call came in from New York. Mr. Koch had told reporters that he didn’t see British troops in Ireland as an “occupying force.” Even then, in the days before the internet and social media, the news still spread rapidly across the Atlantic. “The Irish there and here went crazy,” said George Arzt, Mr. Koch’s press secretary, who immediately began sending surrogates out to speak with members of the city’s Irish community, and arranging meetings for Mr. Koch upon his return. The episode, Mr. Artz said, illustrated the perils of what can happen when the mayor of the largest city in the country leaves town. “Don’t think you are immune to trouble in the city from being out of the city,” Mr. Arzt said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Who Speaks for the Mountain West?,"The Rust Belt gets the attention. But the center of American politics might soon be shifting west. Ms. Mair is a Republican strategist. The political media has been consumed with former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign kickoff, but something else has been going on in presidential politics largely unnoticed. The Mountain West, long a second (or third) thought to the favorite-son, vote-rich Rust Belt states, is stepping, however lightly, into the limelight. Several Mountain West Democrats have jumped into the presidential race (from Colorado, former Gov. John Hickenlooper and Senator Michael Bennet) or are readying themselves to do so (Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, and perhaps others). The Democratic Party has hopes that Arizona, which as John McCain used to observe is about the only state where mothers cannot in good faith tell their kids they can grow up to be president, will move into the Democratic column next year. Not ceding any ground, President Trump’s re-election campaign has decreed that a trio of Mountain West blue states — Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico — are “flippable” in 2020. It’s happy news for the region, which has become tired of being an afterthought for presidential campaigns thanks to its lower population levels and voters who seem to have a natural aversion to the way the rest of the country thinks. But it’s not clear that either party is naturally well placed to appeal to voters in the area, even if it’s nice that they purport to care. In its current Trumpy iteration, the Republican Party is strongly geared toward the interests of the stereotypical Rust Belt swing voter: anti-free trade, very focused on boosting the manufacturing sector at any cost, skeptical of immigration (particularly Hispanic immigration) and spending-happy. It is also concerned about the social safety net most likely because of the number of older voters who vote for the party as well as because of the slow disintegration, visible from the 1980s and compounded by the housing bubble burst in the 2000s, of in-person, human social networks that used to be more robust across the region. Those hallmarks of Trumpism make the re-election campaign’s Mountain West claims seem rather delusional. Still, it’s hardly different for Democrats. Overall, the party is strongly geared toward the interests of stereotypical coastal city dwellers: prioritizing environmental concerns, social justice matters and “wokeness,” and policies aimed at helping people cope with the challenges of booming, pricey-to-live-in cities where “new economy” industries dominate. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is the biggest rock star in the party; Elizabeth Warren is driving a lot of the 2020 field on policy. To the extent Democrats show any interest in moving in a less “coastal elite” direction, their party is also focused on those Rust Belt voters, hence the appeal of Joe Biden (all Pennsylvania, all the time) or, for some, Bernie Sanders. Who speaks for voters living in and around the Rockies — or those of us who think like them? We’re the ones who didn’t get Mr. Trump’s State of the Union line about fences and love (maybe we all grew up hearing our parents or grandparents singing the old cowboy song “Don’t Fence Me In” too much). Even if we’re liberal, we tend to be less averse to gun rights than the big stars of the Democratic Party. We’re generally not brash like Mr. Trump and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, and more quiet-spoken (consider the stereotype of the soft-spoken cowboy). We tend to be more concerned about civil liberties and freedoms and skeptical of government, even if we know it needs to exist and do things. We or our families are people who ditched the rest of the country for the West, so we tend to be a little more sympathetic to immigrants (and hey, a lot of us are immigrants or descended from recent immigrants). We also tend to be a little disdainful of other parts of America with their pet regional concerns that didn’t and don’t translate perfectly for us. We ourselves are, or are often descended from, pioneers. So we don’t like restrictions on trade or mobility and are simultaneously concerned about preservation of wilderness and the ability to use land to generate income. We are a little more libertarianish than voters in the rest of the country. Everyone who has worked in the region knows this — even if it’s hard to demonstrate with raw data. The fact is, we’re going to be hard to firmly sell on either party as currently constructed. And substantive change isn’t coming quite yet, even if hints of it are on display. It won’t matter too much next year; the 2020 census needs to happen before Electoral College votes shift and the Mountain West gain some political dominance. However, that move is coming — and that’s probably the real reason behind the parties’ showing more interest in the area in their different ways, one candidate-driven, one (most likely) purely rhetorical. According to Census Bureau data from July 2017 to July 2018, many of the fastest-growing United States counties are in Nevada, Colorado, Utah and Arizona. Among those losing population are in Appalachia, the Rust Belt region as well as some Mississippi River-bordering and Great Plains areas. Per Pew Trusts, of the 10 states gaining population the fastest, five are in the Mountain West. The fastest-growing state is Utah, but also among the top 10 are Colorado, Nevada, Idaho and Arizona. West Virginia and Illinois are losing population, while other Rust Belt and Northeastern states are growing comparatively slowly. Among the 10 states with the most declining, or slowest-growing, populations are Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Connecticut as well as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Even a recent United Van Lines survey shows the same general trend. The Mountain West — marked by its different philosophical outlook — seems to be a hot ticket. This presidential election will give the parties a chance to figure out how to appeal to the area’s voters instead of just being the less bad option for them in that particular cycle. When the Trump campaign talks about flipping Mountain West states, it’s predicated on the notion that a Democrat as unsalable as Mr. Sanders gets the nod; it’s not because Mr. Trump is morphing into a figure somewhere further along the Bill Richardson-Jon Huntsman-Ken Buck spectrum. If Mr. Trump gets re-elected in 2020, 2024 could get very interesting, though, should a figure like Kyrsten Sinema, a first-term Democratic senator from Arizona, perform well in office and decide to step up. Her former communications director just got hired by Governor Bullock to work Iowa, so she’ll have experienced talent to tap should she so desire. Maybe in the next campaign, Mr. McCain’s old Arizona joke will finally be put to bed by Ms. Sinema, who switched a red state to blue in a year when most Democrats in tight Senate races tanked.

2019,Who Threw the First Brick at Stonewall? Let’s Argue About It,"I’ve been a student of L.G.B.T.Q. history for more than two decades. O.K., “Student of L.G.B.T.Q. history” is kind of a fancy term for a closeted 14-year-old furtively reading about leather bar etiquette and hanky codes (colored hankies were once used by some gay men to signal sexual interests) on GeoCities websites, but along the way I did manage to absorb a decent understanding of gay history in the United States. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, I made a video, “Who Threw the First Brick at Stonewall?” Spoiler alert: No one knows for sure who threw it, or even if a literal brick was thrown. But I wanted to try to find out why the first brick had remained such a popular myth. [The New York Times wants to capture the ever-evolving ways in which we describe ourselves. Tell us who you are.] Those of you who don’t spend hours online gossiping and arguing over RuPaul’s Drag Race contestants might not know how pervasive first brick memes have become in certain queer internet communities. They fall into three categories: earnest attempts to honor giants in the L.G.B.T.Q. movement (“Marsha P. Johnson threw the first brick at Stonewall”), tongue-in-cheek diva worship (“Madonna threw the first brick at Stonewall”) and satirical takedowns of straight celebrities who overplay their hand trying to be queer allies (“Nick Jonas threw the first brick at Stonewall”). I love the silly first brick memes — my favorite to date being that Mario Kart Toadette threw the first brick — but the sincere ones that credited Sylvia Rivera or Marsha P. Johnson with inciting the Stonewall uprising gave me pause. The impact of Ms. Rivera and Ms. Johnson on the trans and gay movements can’t be overstated, but it doesn’t take much digging to learn that they didn’t start the Stonewall rebellion. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the internet can spread misinformation, but why had this particular fantasy of Stonewall taken on such importance in the queer imagination? To find out, I interviewed people who participated in the Stonewall uprising, historians who had devoted years to studying L.G.B.T.Q. history and contemporary queer writers. It turns out that it wasn’t just the question of who threw the first brick: Apparently no one can agree on almost anything about Stonewall. Was a brick thrown, or a cobblestone, or rocks? Was the atmosphere on the street fun and festive, or grave and violent? Were patrons of Stonewall that night grieving Judy Garland’s death? No one could come to consensus on these or many other questions. In a sense, I was comforted by the disagreements of past generations of L.G.B.T.Q. people. While shooting the video, more than once I found myself thinking, “See? Millennials didn’t invent queer infighting!” But I also began to see these disagreements as fundamental to my history. When I interviewed Mark Segal, who was present for several nights of the protests at Stonewall and who was an early member of the Gay Liberation Front, he described the G.L.F. as both “the most dysfunctional organization that has ever existed in the L.G.B.T. community” and “literally why we have everything that we have today.” Indeed, the G.L.F., which was the first queer activist organization formed after Stonewall, argued about everything — its structure, its purpose, its leadership, its mission, and on and on. My favorite anecdote was a disagreement about whether men’s beards posed a masculine insult to women. But the G.L.F. also set the stage for one of the most successful civil rights movements in the United States. Within a year of Stonewall, the G.L.F. organized three simultaneous gay pride marches in three cities — before the concept of a “gay pride parade” even existed. Then they went on to create the first L.G.B.T.Q. community center and the first organization for gay youth and, from what I was told, they never once stopped arguing. And that was a revelation to me — disagreement was not tantamount to ineffectiveness. There is much hand-wringing about disagreements in my community. I hear things like “we can’t get anything done because all we do is argue” or “we’re eating our own instead of banding together.” Producing this video and conducting these interviews reminded me that separating disagreement from effectiveness is a false binary. Granted, the arguments at the G.L.F. were happening face to face, and the disagreements in my community are largely mitigated by algorithms and social media platforms — and therefore ultimately controlled by money and capital. But after talking with many L.G.B.T.Q. elders, I’m more wary of the medium of social media than I am of the disagreements themselves. Fifty years after Stonewall, we’re still arguing about what happened on that night. And that’s kind of the point: Stonewall was, at its core, about people reclaiming their narratives from a society that told them they were sick or pitiful or didn’t even exist. Getting to tell your own story is a gift, but it means that you have to contend with other people’s stories, and I guess that can mean arguing, maybe for 50 years straight. And that’s O.K.",The New York Times
2019,Who Was Most Opposed to Freeing 2 Reporters in Myanmar? Aung San Suu Kyi,"BANGKOK — The biggest obstacle to releasing two imprisoned Reuters reporters in Myanmar was not the country’s military, diplomats and others say, but its de facto civilian leader: Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate and former political prisoner herself who once declared, “Please use your liberty to promote ours.” Her seemingly incongruous opposition to freeing the two reporters, U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo, who were let go this week after more than a year in detention, was well known among the diplomatic emissaries who repeatedly had urged her to release them. At times, she became angry when foreigners raised the case of the two men, who were imprisoned in connection with their coverage of the country’s crackdown on the Rohingya minority. In an interview on Japanese television, she declared that they broke the law even before a court had delivered a verdict. After their conviction, she insisted that their legal appeals must be completed before she would intervene, despite clear evidence that the police entrapped them. She defied a relentless if quiet campaign by the Reuters news service, the United States government and other Western nations to free the pair. But the international pressure appeared to have an effect in recent weeks, at least among Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s top aides. In late April, after Myanmar’s Supreme Court upheld the reporters’ conviction, her spokesman, U Zaw Htay, quietly advised an intermediary that their families should stop filing legal appeals, clearing the way for a presidential pardon, according to three people in the chain of communications. After the families received his back-channel message, they dropped plans for further appeals and quickly drafted a new pardon request, said Pan Ei Mon, Mr. Wa Lone’s wife. Mr. Zaw Htay declined to comment on his role in communicating with the families or on Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s opposition to the reporters’ release until now. The release of the Reuters journalists is a rare concession by the Myanmar authorities in the face of intense global pressure but it is unlikely to shift attention away from the hundreds of people still imprisoned or facing charges for speaking out. The two journalists were arrested in December 2017 after they uncovered a mass grave in Rakhine State, where the military is accused by the United Nations of committing genocide against Rohingya Muslims, killing and raping thousands and forcing more than 700,000 to flee the country. The two reporters, who were awarded the Pulitzer Prize while they were behind bars, left prison on Tuesday after more than 16 months, ending a case that had brought global condemnation of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and disrepute to her country. The civilian leader has been conspicuously silent about their release, possibly suggesting she remains embittered. “Because of her stubbornness and her state of denial over the abuses in Rakhine and the international criticism she received, she became the main obstacle in resolving the case,” said David S. Mathieson, an independent analyst of Myanmar’s politics. “It became a very personal case for her, publicly and privately.” As the reporters remained in prison, they became a symbol of the government’s attempts to suppress free speech and to minimize or deny the atrocities in Rakhine. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, share power with the military in a contentious arrangement enshrined in the military-drafted Constitution of 2008. The daughter of the country’s founding general, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 while under house arrest, and became a symbol of resistance to tyranny. Many of her supporters expected her to expand protections for human rights and free expression after her party swept parliamentary elections in 2015. Instead, crackdowns on free speech have persisted during her tenure and hundreds of people are now in prison or face charges for speaking out. Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, who had been investigating the massacre of 10 villagers in Rakhine State, were arrested as they left a meeting with the police. One officer handed them rolled up papers, which were later said to contain state secrets. At trial, a police captain testified that the two had been entrapped. He was later convicted of having violated the police disciplinary code and was sentenced to a year in prison. Other prosecution witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the arrest and contradicted the police claim that information in the papers was secret. Nevertheless, the court found the pair guilty in September of having violated the colonial-era Official Secrets Act and sentenced them to seven years in prison. Within Myanmar, the prevailing view was that the two men were guilty and traitorous for having exposed the massacre, complicating any possible pardon. But the barrage of international criticism and quiet pressure from diplomats and others seeking their release prompted members of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s government to seek a solution. The simplest answer, it seemed, was for the government to free them as part of an annual general amnesty, in which thousands of prisoners are released in mid-April. But time was running short. The Supreme Court released its decision upholding the pair’s conviction on April 23. Barely a week later, the office of the president, U Win Myint, had the families’ new pardon petition in hand. With the legal process complete, they were pardoned in time for a third and final wave of prisoner amnesties on Tuesday. Among those who pushed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to free the reporters was Bill Richardson, an American statesman and former United Nations ambassador. When he raised the issue with her early last year, she “exploded,” he said. “Her face was quivering, and if she had been a little closer to me, she might have hit me, she was so furious,” he recounted. Mr. Richardson, who had long considered Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi a friend, resigned from a Myanmar advisory board on the Rohingya crisis because, he said, it was being used as “a cheerleading squad for the government.” Another source of pressure on Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi came from the Trump administration, which some free-press advocates considered a surprise because of its attacks on the news media. Vice President Mike Pence took the lead in seeking the Reuters reporters’ freedom. In November, Mr. Pence confronted Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi about the case at a regional forum in Singapore. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi responded that the legal appeals process would have to conclude before any chance of presidential pardons. During the trial, the United States ambassador to Myanmar, Scot Marciel, attended court hearings along with diplomats from other nations. Administration officials said that after the conviction, people around Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi sought to push her toward a position of leniency. On Tuesday, Mr. Pence, speaking at a conference on Latin American issues at the State Department, opened his speech by praising the release of the reporters and saying he hoped it “signals a positive and permanent respect for a free and independent press.” As part of the strategy to free the reporters, their supporters in Myanmar organized a 28-member legal team that included a retired judge, a former member of Parliament and legal experts from a wide range of nongovernmental organizations. In December, the team issued a statement calling the conviction flawed and an obvious case of entrapment. Thar Lon Zaung Htet, founder of the Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists and a secretary of the Myanmar Press Council, helped the families communicate with top officials over the months, including Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, and with arguably the country’s most powerful figure, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. “When I met Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing, I asked him to help in the Reuters reporters’ case,” Mr. Thar Lon Zaung Htet said. “He replied to me that he would help if he could. When I asked Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, she did not answer.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Who’s Afraid of China’s Internet Vigilantes?,"It isn’t just government censorship that is restricting free expression in China. It’s also the “human flesh searches.” Ms. Li is a freelance journalist. When social media emerged in my country almost 10 years ago, my peers and I were excited. Here was a space where Chinese people like us could share everything, we thought, from bits of daily life to our unvarnished views on public affairs. We were naïvely optimistic back then about the prospect, as a famous phrase at the time put it, of “onlookers changing China.” Things did not turn out that way. Nearly a decade later, the growing silence on social media when it comes to sensitive public issues is deafening. Most of us now refrain from posting things that are potentially controversial. That’s in part because of tightened censorship. But it’s also because of a phenomenon called “renrou sousuo,” or “human flesh search” — the deliberate marshaling of the forces of the internet against those deemed harmful to the public good. This, in its own way, has been just as responsible for the chilling effect. The term sounds creepy — and it is. “Human flesh searches” are all about punishing people whom the cyberspace masses decide are deserving of public attention and scorn. It’s effectively an effort to use crowdsourcing to reveal and broadcast the real-life identities of those who had been essentially anonymous online — call it doxxing with Chinese characteristics. Such searches can delve into territory like people’s whereabouts, their relationships and even details about their relatives and close friends. People’s lives and careers can be ruined, even their safety jeopardized, once they’ve been targeted by such a hunt. When the phenomenon arose in China in the late 2000s, its targets were typically morally unambiguous. One of the earliest cases involved a woman who posted acts of animal abuse online — one example included stomping a kitten to death with stilettos — and stirred up anger across the nation. The practice was soon picked up by people seeking to expose the extravagance of allegedly corrupt, or at least not public-minded, local officials. In 2012, for instance, a man who appeared to be a party cadre was captured on video grinning at the scene of a bus crash that had killed 36 passengers in Shaanxi Province. The internet was furious. Soon this person’s name and position were unearthed, along with his expensive tastes: designer watches, belts and eyeglasses that were incompatible with his supposedly meager government pay. Social media users labeled him Watch Uncle and he was eventually dismissed from his post. At the time, some believed that in a society where justice through the judicial system remains elusive, this kind of citizen-driven hunt had a role to play as a sort of ad hoc, ground-up form of the rule of law. It was also perhaps the only way for ordinary Chinese citizens to offer some sort of check on the excesses of government officials. But these sort of quasi-juridical activities quickly subsided. Potential targets learned their lessons and started keeping lower profiles. The government began pushing its own anti-corruption campaign later that year, which meant that officials became much more cautious about anything that might hint at a luxurious lifestyle and also that spontaneous exposure of official wrongdoing outside state-run media would no longer be tolerated. And so in recent years, more often than not, human flesh searches have been associated with rising ultranationalism in China. Vigilantes today dig through people’s comments online for any sign of unpatriotic sins. Today, in addition to renrou sousuo, we have another creepy term for these activities: “ba pi,” which literally means “to skin,” that is, to expose. [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.] One of the most high-profile cases of this unfolded in the summer of 2017, when Yang Shuping, a University of Maryland student from China, delivered a graduation speech in which she drew a parallel between China’s air pollution and its restrictions on free speech. She was immediately a target of renrou sousuo: The state-owned media depicted her as an unpatriotic traitor belittling the homeland, while angry netizens spread everything they could find out about her, including the address of her family back in China. Death threats were made on social media, and there were rumors, difficult to confirm, that some social media users even paid a visit to her parents’ home. Ms. Yang eventually apologized and deleted all her posts on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. More recently, a victim of the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March, a young Chinese woman, unexpectedly became a target. The animosity toward her after her tragic death appears to have been prompted by a combination of nationalism and class resentment: Photos she’d posted showed that she was probably from a well-to-do family, and there were rumors that she’d had a foreign boyfriend. Social media users dug up her Weibo account, worked out what school she’d attended and spread around old pictures. “When I see you staying in a hotel that costs thousands of yuan a night, eating fancy food, and that you can afford to fly to Kenya when you want to see giraffes, even though I won’t say I’m happy for your demise, I definitely do not have sympathy for you,” one commenter wrote. Another said, “Our country isn’t vast enough for you to spend vacation time in?” I am not arguing that all those targeted have been innocent. There have been occasions during which the tens of thousands of internet users who have mobilized to “right wrongs” were fueled by legitimate motives. Yet whether the questionable behavior concerns fortune flaunting, supposedly unpatriotic political views or expensive vacations, society needs to consider how much public harassment or privacy invasion, if any, is justified. As a formerly outspoken social media user who once had a big following, I have experienced my own share of online abuse. I’ve been inundated with personal attacks and photos intended to intimidate, though nothing as horrifying as a human flesh search. That I have since opted to lay low and stay relatively silent on social media is not a coincidence. It isn’t just me: Fear of zealous vigilantes on the internet has led more and more people to restrict unorthodox political views or anecdotes of their private lives to family and close friends. Human flesh searches had remained generally unfettered by regulations until 2017, when the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate announced that depending on the severity of the invasion and dispersion of personal information, a perpetrator could get jail time. It remains to be seen, however, whether this regulation will simply be applied selectively to punish those the authorities dislike, as has happened in the case of restrictions on “rumor spreading.” We cannot count on vigilantism to change Chinese society for the better. It ought to be an independent legal system — the sort that we lack — rather than outbursts of internet fury, public humiliation, mass intimidation and populist vengeance that are responsible for upholding justice. Nor can cyberbullying ever lead to real patriotism. And everyone is entitled to privacy protection, even those whose morals might seem dubious, because privacy and freedom of speech are like two sides of a coin: Each is required for the other to thrive. And the last thing a country desperate for freer expression needs is a self-righteous crowd doing the authorities’ work for them. Audrey Jiajia Li is a nonfiction writer and broadcast journalist.

2019,Why 1999 Was Hollywood’s Greatest Year,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. BEST. MOVIE. YEAR. EVER. How 1999 Blew Up the Big Screen By Brian Raftery Cinema’s best year ever? For decades, Old Hollywood purists have argued for 1939, which brought us “Gone With the Wind,” “Stagecoach,” “The Women,” “The Wizard of Oz,” “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” “Dark Victory,” “Intermezzo” and many more. Others plant the flag for 19-seventy-9; lately, the writer Rich Cohen has been churning out essays on Medium in praise of that year’s bounty: “Apocalypse Now,” “Mad Max,” “Being There,” “Alien,” “All That Jazz” and comedies such as “The Jerk,” “The In-Laws,” “Life of Brian” and “Real Life.” Now comes the culture critic Brian Raftery with “Best. Movie. Year. Ever.: How 1999 Blew Up the Big Screen.” He focuses on a bumper crop of breakthrough, subversive, auteur-driven movies — virtually all of which were released theatrically in 1999 — quoting the actor Edward Norton (of 1999’s “Fight Club”), who is hard pressed to name any other 12-month span “that had more really original young filmmakers tapping into the zeitgeist.” Raftery makes a persuasive, entertaining case for the enduring impact of a passel of classics, from “American Beauty” to “American Movie” to “American Pie.” Among them: “The Matrix,” “The Sixth Sense,” “Boys Don’t Cry,” “Three Kings,” “Being John Malkovich,” “The Best Man,” “The Insider,” “The Virgin Suicides,” “Magnolia” and “Election.” He weaves together film history and cheeky anecdotes from Hollywood insiders, recounting a midnight rave here, a nude ski run there. His tone, like the period’s, is jaunty but jaundiced. When “The Matrix” was conceived, he observes, “the mainstream web was still in its modem-wheezing early days.” “Fight Club,” he contends, had “the proper alchemy of madcap and menace.” Raftery’s voice and thesis suit today’s craving for Nineties Nostalgia. In what the author describes as a cinematic counterinsurgency, many Class of ’99 filmmakers — weaned on TV remotes, joysticks, music videos and the web — dispensed with linear narratives and incorporated the “A.D.D.-addled storytelling of modern nonfiction television.” Chronology was crunched in the ecstasy-laced “Go,” the micro-budgeted “Following” and “Run Lola Run,” which played out like a video game. Lana and Lilly Wachowski’s “The Matrix,” as Raftery sees it, tapped into the idea that “online, reality was becoming bendable,” a concept encapsulated in a revolutionary CGI sequence in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) miraculously evades a hurtling bullet. “‘The Matrix,’” Raftery writes, “nudged viewers to develop their own slowed-down, omniscient, bullet-time view of the world around them: Who controls my life?” Indeed, the themes of “The Matrix,” including our quest to decipher hidden, alternative realities, still bewitch us. (A few months ago, in fact, New York magazine published “19 Things ‘The Matrix’ Predicted About Life in 2019.”) These maverick directors borrowed from hacker and web culture, their films foreshadowing social media’s dark descent. The internet colors Spike Jonze’s “Being John Malkovich,” in which sojourners adopt the actor John Malkovich’s body as their avatar. According to Malkovich himself, Charlie Kaufman’s script addressed the media-fueled “need we have … to lead sort of virtual lives.” This compulsion to recast one’s identity was also at the twisted core of 1999’s “The Talented Mr. Ripley” as well as “Man on the Moon,” in which Jim Carrey essentially transformed himself (on set and off) into the gonzo performance artist-comedian Andy Kaufman. Without the web, there would have been no “Blair Witch Project,” the homemade sham-snuff horror movie that became a case study in online promotion. The indie film’s faux vérité shared the fraudulent authenticity of a new genre, reality TV. And once “Blair Witch” went viral, as Raftery puts it, it helped “fringe fears go mainstream,” a fright-wig stepchild of Oliver Stone movies and “The X-Files.” Many of the movies, Raftery points out, came with a fin de siècle edge: a pervading apocalyptic angst. The story lines, with their aggrieved outsiders and collapsing families, prophesied our current condition, post-9/11 — plagued as we are by forever wars, increasing wealth disparity and the oppressive rise of the autocrat, the bigot, the corporate state. Frogs rain from the sky in “Magnolia.” The Burnham household implodes in “American Beauty.” Sexual obsession and decadence envelop “Eyes Wide Shut.” Angry young white guys rage against the machine in “Fight Club,” whose release was postponed in the wake of the killings at Columbine. “Boys Don’t Cry,” which recounts the murder of Brandon Teena, a transgender man, was filmed, Raftery says, just as “Matthew Shepard was kidnapped, pistol-whipped and tied to a fence in … Wyoming.” For all this, the book has its hiccups. Raftery, despite a nice shout-out to John Hughes, favors ’90s kids-in-crisis films over “crummier Reagan-era teen movies.” There’s no mention of “Quiet: We Live in Public,” the dystopian social experiment webcammed 24/7 on the eve of the new millennium — until the cops shut it down. That said, Raftery dares to think bigger than the big screen. He explains that once HBO rolled out “The Sopranos” in January 1999, its influence would prove seismic: Thereafter, a generation’s most engaging onscreen stories would be serials, viewed in our homes or on our phones. He notes, as well, that in 1999, when AOL began its $165 billion play for the Time Warner colossus, the deal presaged the current Digital Ice Age, in which tech (Netflix, Amazon et al.) is slowly slaying the Hollywood dinosaur. Raftery’s right. Nineteen-ninety-nine did rewire how we tell stories in moving pictures. Morpheus, we’re not in Kansas anymore. Then again, “Best. Movie. Year. Ever.” may also be biased, inflating the significance of the cultural touchstones of its author’s youth. In that regard, I’d like to speak up for 1968, which turned out “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Rosemary’s Baby,” “Yellow Submarine,” “The Producers,” “Bullitt,” “The Lion in Winter,” “Night of the Living Dead,” …",The New York Times
2019,Why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Endorsed a Little-Known Public Defender in Queens,"Big City This week, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made the second political endorsement of her brief career in Congress, bringing her firepower to an ideological soul mate, a 31-year-old lawyer named Tiffany Cabán, who is among seven Democratic candidates running for district attorney in Queens. The position is not insignificant. A county of 2.3 million people, Queens is the size of Houston. Richard A. Brown, who died earlier this month, served as district attorney for the past 28 years and ran the office aggressively, as if the days of “Mean Streets’’ were still with us. On the left there is a certain enthusiasm for a new approach. Brown’s views were locked into place during his earlier years in law enforcement; on his first day on the job as a Manhattan criminal court judge in 1973, a defendant opened fire in his courtroom, causing him to hide under a bench. “Richard Brown was shaped by the era of broken windows, stop-and-frisk and other policies that led to mass incarceration,’’ Bill Lipton, an early and ardent supporter of Ms. Cabán’s and a founder of the Working Families Party, told me. “Tiffany is the future.’’ Nearly every other candidate in the race, including Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president who has been the front-runner thus far, could lay claim to that designation as well. All are running as progressives committed to undoing the damages wrought by so many years of needlessly sending young black and Latino men to prison. Ms. Cabán distinguishes herself by way of biography. For the past seven years, she has been a public defender in Manhattan, where she has witnessed benighted prosecutorial styles pushing defendants further and further away from the chance of ever gaining their equilibrium. She has seen violent felony charges attached to people who simply stole luggage or Amazon packages from the lobbies of apartment buildings. She watched individuals being sent back to prison over and over because they weren’t getting the help they needed. “Rikers is the biggest mental-health hospital in the city,’’ Ms. Cabán said, talking about the city’s largest and most infamous jail. Once she had a client who kept getting locked up for short stretches — 30 days here, 60 days there — all for misdemeanors. He had been physically abused as a child and was prone to getting into fistfights. At a certain point when he landed back in court, a prosecutor demanded that he be sent away for nine months so that he would finally learn his lesson. “I said, ‘Do you really think the problem is that he doesn’t know that what he is doing is wrong?’” Ms. Cabán recalled. She grew angrier at the myopia she saw around her, at the failure of so many prosecutors to understand that trauma is often passed down generationally among people living in poverty. Then, two years ago, Larry Krasner ran for district attorney in Philadelphia. Ms. Cabán became obsessed with the race and what it promised, namely a way to abandon fossilized, tough-on-crime rhetoric in favor of calls to upend the system so that harsh consequence and arbitrary punishment were no longer default goals. Mr. Krasner had practiced both criminal defense and civil rights law; he, too, had been a public defender. In his first year as Philadelphia’s district attorney, city prosecutors opened 6,500 fewer cases than they had the previous year, crucially reducing the number of misdemeanor cases filed and making Mr. Krasner a kind of messiah to advocates for criminal-justice reform. Other public defenders have since seen the wisdom of switching sides, so to speak. Last year Geneviéve Jones-Wright ran for district attorney in San Diego, arguing that too few of her clients had received recommendations for diversion programs from the district attorney’s office that would keep them out of the courts. She lost to a prosecutor but received the support of George Soros. Currently, Chesa Boudin, San Francisco’s deputy public defender, is running for district attorney there. Mr. Boudin is the son of Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, members of the Weather Underground who were sent to prison in conjunction with the 1981 Brink’s robbery. He is campaigning in part on the promise that he will reduce high rates of recidivism and help those arrested find jobs and pursue their education. In addition to the backing from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Cabán has the advantage of going up against a chief rival who has been a career politician, with all the fustiness that that implies. Ms. Katz has neither been a defense lawyer nor a prosecutor; as a member of the New York State Assembly in the 1990s she voted to reinstate the death penalty, a position she now disavows. Should Ms. Cabán win the Democratic primary next month, she would presumably serve as a role model for other young progressives to effect change from the inside. The problem, though, is that vision will get you only so far. The position of district attorney requires running a huge office, staffed with people who have grown set in their ways, often over decades. Mr. Krasner, who is in his 50s, came to the Philadelphia district attorney’s office and quickly fired people. He goes around the country as an evangelist for reform-minded prosecutorial work, often trying to talk aspiring public defenders to embark on his line of work instead. (This has angered some in public-defender circles.) Ms. Cabán is young — she has never had a supervisory role in her defense work. She, or anyone coming in with a like-minded agenda, would need deputies who commanded the respect of whatever lawyers remained among the old guard. If you believe, as many legal scholars do, that the future of criminal-justice reform really lies with prosecutors, then the success of the movement depends on the election of district attorneys who posses a skill, native or acquired, for the comparatively dull business of management. Who is best suited to change institutional culture? Sometimes it is the person who has sat furthest away from it. An earlier version of this article misstated where Tiffany Cabán serves as a public defender. For the past seven years, she has done so in Manhattan, not Queens.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Annuities Are Popular,"letter The Alliance for Lifetime Income says the guaranteed retirement income they provide is a vital safety net. To the Editor: Re “The Way to Stop Predatory Lending” (editorial, May 23): We take issue with your criticism of fixed indexed annuities.

Sales of annuities are also growing for other important reasons, including rising market volatility and higher interest rates. The annuities industry — like every industry — faces rare, unacceptable sales practices. Yet annuities are popular because they provide retirement security in a volatile financial world.

2019,"Why Apollo 10 Stopped Just 47,000 Feet From the Moon","Essay In a year when we’ll celebrate Apollo 11’s 50th anniversary, it’s worth remembering the pathfinders who completed the same mission with one critical order: don’t actually land on the moon. The command service module, dubbed “Charlie Brown” for the Apollo 10 mission to the moon, viewed from the lunar module “Snoopy” in 1969.CreditCreditJSC/NASA Soon we will recognize the 50th anniversary of the first humans to walk on the moon. We remember and celebrate the heroism of the Apollo 11 crew: the humility of Neil Armstrong making those first bootprints; the cool bravado of Buzz Aldrin during the critical moments of the Eagle lander’s final descent; and, the lonely vigil of Michael Collins in orbit above his mates, waiting to bring them back home. But we also need to celebrate the many pathfinders who made this historic mission possible. Among the most critical were the crew of Apollo 10, who were asked to perform a full dress-rehearsal of the Apollo 11 mission just two months beforehand. Commander Thomas P. Stafford; John W. Young, the command module pilot; and Eugene A. Cernan, lunar module pilot, did almost everything that Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins did, but they stopped just before landing on the moon. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Imagine if Ferdinand and Isabella had sent a ship to the New World in 1491 and asked its captain and crew to find new lands to the west without getting out of the ship to set foot on them, because the next captain and crew were scheduled to do that in 1492. Or picture President Thomas Jefferson sending a party to scout passage to the Pacific Ocean in 1803, then saying, don’t touch a thing, especially not the ocean — because Lewis and Clark are scheduled to do that the following year. It seems unfathomable, to go all that way, to take all of those risks and then pull back, not grabbing the brass ring and reaping the rewards. In a sense, though, those were the instructions, and that was the burden, borne by the relatively unheralded crew of Apollo 10 fifty years ago this month. Spurred by President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 speech challenging the nation to “commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth,” NASA went on an 8-year lunar sprint. This bold endeavor would employ close to a half million engineers, technicians, scientists and others both in government and industry. It also cost the lives of three heroic astronauts — Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee — who perished in the 1967 Apollo 1 fire. Successive Apollo flights had to become both safer and more daring at the same time to meet Kennedy’s deadline. Delays in the completion of the lunar lander, also known as the Lunar Excursion Module, meant that Apollo 8 would be the first crewed lunar mission to fly the command module only, from which 1968’s famed “Earthrise” photo was taken. It fell to the crew of Apollo 9 in March 1969, to fly the first test mission of the lander into space, spending 10 days in Earth orbit. The stage was set, then for a full dress rehearsal by the next crew to the launchpad. Apollo 10’s officers had all earned astronaut wings during Project Gemini, NASA’s precursor to Apollo. Their mission aboard was simple: Practice and work out the kinks and set the stage for a successful landing on the moon (and safe return to Earth). But there was one critical order: don’t actually land on the moon. It would be the first time the moon lander was flown in the environment for which it was built. All of the risks that they would take to prove out the equipment and procedures — launching; Earth-orbital docking; the three-day Earth to Moon cruise; lunar orbit undocking; descent of the lander nicknamed Snoopy almost to the surface; reascending and re-docking; three more days back to Earth; then a Pacific Ocean splashdown — were the same risks the Apollo 11 crew would have to take, with one distinction. A moon landing was not to be. They executed the rehearsal flawlessly. While Young circled above them in the command and service module nicknamed Charlie Brown, Stafford and Cernan undocked for their descent toward the landing site in the smooth, dark volcanic plains of the Sea of Tranquillity. “You’ll never know how big this thing is when there ain’t nobody in here but one guy,” Young told his departing friends from his lonely outpost. As they began to fall toward the surface, Cernan quipped back, “You’ll never know how small it looks when you’re as far away as we are.” They would eventually guide the lander to within only about 47,000 feet above the surface — close enough to test the landing radar and around the same maximum altitude of commercial aircraft above Earth’s surface. While relaying their reactions and perspective back to Young aboard Charlie Brown, Cernan called out, “Oh Charlie! We just saw Earthrise and it’s got to be magnificent!” The view of the stark lunar landscape below them from that altitude, scarred by billions of years of impact cratering, was just as stunning to the crew. Transcripts of their conversations reveal that they didn’t have much free time to admire it though, given the intense concentration (and occasional computer glitch repair) needed to fly Snoopy. Still, at one point Stafford remarked, “It looks like we’re getting so close all you have to do is put your tail hook down and we’re there.” Cernan was just as excited, exclaiming, “We are close, babe! This is, like, it!” Snapping photos out the window and noting the many boulders that they could clearly see, Stafford proclaimed, “Tell Jack Schmitt,” referring to their geologist-astronaut colleague and future Apollo 17 moon walker, “that there’s enough boulders down here to fill up Galveston Bay too!” What ran through their minds when the command finally came from Houston to fire the ascent engine and head back up? It must have been so tempting to go for a landing. Cernan was wistful: “The spacecraft is looking good and there are no problems, Charlie, except it would be nice to be around here more often …” But Snoopy didn’t have enough fuel to land on the moon and then blast off again. According to Craig Nelson, author of the book “Rocket Men,” Cernan speculated that the lander’s ascent module had been short-fueled on purpose: “A lot of people thought about the kind of people we were: ‘Don’t give those guys an opportunity to land, ‘cause they might!’” Two months later as the entire world looked on, human footsteps were at last emblazoned on the dusty surface of the moon by Neil and Buzz. The willingness of the Apollo 10 crew to serve as something like stand-ins instead of the stars of the show would in time be generously rewarded by NASA. Young descended those final few miles to the moon’s surface as commander of Apollo 16, and later commanded the first flight of the space shuttle. Cernan, too, made it to the surface as the commander of Apollo 17 in 1972, and is still the last person to have walked on the moon. Although Stafford never again returned to the moon, he was the American commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975, docking with Soviet counterparts in Earth orbit in a joint effort to redirect the space race toward an emerging détente between the world’s superpowers. In the annals of history, the mission of Apollo 10 has been overshadowed by later journeys to the lunar surface.

2019,Why Are Milkshakes Being Thrown at Right-Wing Politicians Like Nigel Farage?,"LONDON — Until recently, an egg tended to be the object of choice for protesters hoping to splatter a politician’s clothing with a sticky mess and cause embarrassment without any serious injury. Now, in several protests against rightist politicians in Britain, activists have found a new foodstuff to use as ammunition: milkshakes. On Tuesday, a man was charged with assault and criminal damage after he threw a milkshake at Nigel Farage, one of Britain’s most prominent and divisive Brexit leaders, in the latest in a string of similar episodes. Mr. Farage, a member of the European Parliament who leads the newly founded Brexit Party, had been campaigning on Monday afternoon in Newcastle, a city in northeastern England, when he was targeted. As Mr. Farage walked away from the small crowd he was addressing, Paul Crowther, 32, lifted the lid from his milkshake and doused Mr. Farage with the creamy drink. [5 Takeaways From the European Elections.] The politician’s navy suit, purple tie and light-blue Brexit Party badge were left dripping in banana and salted caramel milkshake, which Mr. Crowther told reporters he had bought at Five Guys, a nearby fast-food outlet. “A complete failure,” Mr. Farage could be heard saying in video of the episode, as members of his security team led him away and others seized Mr. Crowther. “Could have spotted that a mile off.” Mr. Farage seems to have been berating his security detail for not anticipating the action, particularly considering the current climate of “milkshaking,” as the practice has come to be known. Mr. Crowther was charged with common assault and criminal damage, Northumbria Police said in a statement on Tuesday. This month, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, a British far-right activist and former leader of the extremist English Defense League who is also running for the European Parliament, was hit by two milkshakes in one day at the start of the recent spate. Danyaal Mahmud, who first doused Mr. Robinson, told the newspaper The Observer that he had taken the action after becoming offended by what Mr. Robinson had been saying to him. He said he had used a milkshake simply because it had been in his hand at the time. The moment was captured on video and quickly spread on social media. A day later, in a different city in northern England, Mr. Robinson was again splattered with milkshake. Carl Benjamin, a member of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party who is under investigation about a comment he made on Twitter regarding raping a female Labour lawmaker, was later targeted. He has been hit with four separate milkshake attacks so far. Other attacks on the far right have been encouraged on social media with the hashtag #SplashTheFash. The practice has prompted an angry backlash from some rightists. “Just to be clear, anyone that comes at me with a milkshake will need the straw to eat their meals for the next few months,” Mark Meechan, another UKIP candidate, wrote on Twitter this month. The attacks have also caught the eye of the police. In preparation for a weekend rally for Mr. Farage in Edinburgh, officers have asked McDonald’s to briefly stop selling milkshakes on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the fast food chain said. But why milkshakes? Kevin Featherstone, a professor of European politics at the London School of Economics, said in an email that the strong visual impact was important. “The recipient looks ridiculous and it debunks the politician’s aura,” he said. “The attacker is saying, ‘You don’t represent me, with your darker side of politics.’ ” Benjamin Franks, a senior lecturer of social and political philosophy at the university of Glasgow, said in an email that, while he doubted that the original dousing had been planned, the practice had quickly taken off. “I think it latterly caught the imagination of anti-fascist protesters because, as there is an abundance of fast food outlets in U.K. cities, it is easily available and — at least at first — could be carried without raising suspicion,” he said. Milk has been adopted by some white supremacists as a symbol of their movement, but Mr. Franks said that the protesters’ actions had effectively turned that notion on its head. “It turns a symbol used by the alt right — milk — to symbolize ‘whiteness’ and to mock ethnic groups with a greater predisposition to lactose intolerance, into an image of dramatic opposition,” Mr. Franks said. Unlike some of the other politicians targeted, Mr. Farage, who has spent 20 years as a member of the European Parliament, is one of the most recognizable faces in the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. The Brexit Party is currently leading the polls in Britain for the elections to the European Parliament. After he was doused, Mr. Farage blamed “radicalized” Britons who disagreed with Brexit for making normal campaigning impossible. And many have argued that attacking a candidate with food created an atmosphere of aggression and was an inadequate response to the polarizing politics of Mr. Farage. Brendan Cox, the husband of Jo Cox — a member of the British Parliament who was killed in a 2016 attack — said that, while he disagreed with Mr. Farage’s politics and his “willingness to pander to hatred,” throwing milkshakes was not the answer. “I don’t think throwing stuff at politicians you disagree with is a good idea,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that it normalized violence and intimidation.",The New York Times
2019,Why Are We Living in a Golden Age of Historical Fiction?,"Notes on the Culture In tumultuous times, novels tend to look forward to a dystopian future, but authors are increasingly writing about the past. IN A 2013 interview, the author Jonathan Franzen, whose novels have been hailed as a “picture window” on contemporary middle-class American life, articulated the feelings of many readers when he admitted his resistance to historical fiction, explaining that he was drawn to writers who were “engaged in trying to make sense of their lives and of the world in which they find themselves, writers who palpably have skin in the game.” It’s a sentiment that’s hard not to agree with — is it not cheating to use the past as a ready allegory, making of it a handy mirror in which to see ourselves and our futures? But as we near the third decade of the 21st century, the urge to look back feels different: Making sense of our lives and of the unfathomable world in which we find ourselves has necessitated an understanding of what has come before — a clarification of the game and its stakes but also its rules and positions. A new kind of historical fiction has evolved to show us that the past is no longer merely prologue but story itself, shaping our increasingly fractured fairy tales about who we are as a society. The unmooring of time can be found everywhere, in battles for social progress we thought we’d already fought and won. In the media age, history is not simply a chain of facts recorded by scholars but a complex narrative harnessed by political parties and Facebook disinformation campaigns to speak to our sense of identity and belonging. The past we inherit speaks to us individually and collectively, but a common thread, much less a consensus view of reality, feels increasingly hard to come by. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] In times of uncertainty, we expect the shadowy mirror of literature to cast ahead to a dystopian future, predicated on the idea that these visions won’t actually come to pass. But when we begin to recognize ourselves in visions of the future past, it summons a form of déjà vu surely deserving of its own French term, one that conveys the special dread of watching our own cautionary tales become real. It comes as little surprise that Margaret Atwood, the great seer of our decline, is working on a sequel to “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Written during the rise of the religious right in 1984, when “family values” became a euphemism for intolerance, the original novel conjures a misogynist patriarchy that today has been normalized and legislated to a degree that few felt possible then. To read it now feels a lot like putting one’s hand in a drawer and slamming it over and over again. As visions of the future increasingly fail in the face of our present moment, literary authors are increasingly looking back, not to comfort us with a sense of known past, or even an easy allegory of the present, but instead — motivated by a kind of clue-gathering — to seek reasons for why we are the way we are and how we got here, and at what point the train began to derail. Writers, including Colson Whitehead and George Saunders, Anna Burns and Marlon James, Gina Apostol and Yaa Gyasi, to name just a few, have been making clarity of chaos, not to hand us answers but to capture the way history shapes, wounds and implicates us. When the German Romantic Novalis wrote that “novels rise out of the shortcomings of history,” he could not have foreseen the ways in which, centuries later, those shortcomings would come to seem more like outright failings. Too many for too long were left out, the true architectures of power concealed. Theirs are novels that reveal the emptiness of the old stories, destabilizing our ideas of history rather than affirming them — which is, after all, one purpose of literary fiction. In our days of sloganeering and apocryphal tweets, it’s also a form of resistance. HISTORICAL FICTION ARISES out of a desire to see the human project in a continuum, out of the belief that it is possible to tell stories about a vanishing past that bear on the immediate present, forged at the place at which the archives end and the author’s imagination begins. The desire to hit the pause button — to “awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed,” as Walter Benjamin put it in his last completed manuscript, “Theses on the Philosophy of History” (1940) — underwrites Julie Orringer’s new novel, “The Flight Portfolio.” The novel tells the story of Varian Fry, a little-known American journalist who helped smuggle thousands of artists out of Nazi Europe. Among the artists Fry rescued were Marc Chagall and Max Ernst — but also, in a meta-twist, writers who would shape our understanding of the 20th century, including Hannah Arendt and the German novelist and playwright Lion Feuchtwanger. Set in Vichy France, the novel seeks a kind of redress: restoring, to history’s vast panorama, a granular sense of how life on the borderlines of fascism feels. We’re treated to a glimpse of André Breton at a party, fashioning an impromptu brooch from a dead bumblebee, though the novel’s emphasis is not on charming details but the banality of a certain kind of evil made up of bureaucrats, bribery and lines of desperate people waiting for a lifeboat in the form of a visa that will never come, faced with exclusionary American immigration policies not so different than those in place today. As a semi-closeted gay man, Fry finds a nihilistic kind of freedom during his time in Marseille, but his task — based on the notion that some lives are worth more than others — resists heroic gloss. Orringer’s true subject, the moral peril of being alive, is a grandly timeless — and timely — one. If history belongs to the victors, it’s generally fallen to everyone else — the women, the colonized or enslaved, those on the other side of wars and walls — to subvert conventional understanding of it, to make up for the burned or redacted documents, the missing transcripts and the experiences that were never recorded in the first place. In the 20th century, historical fiction acquired its dreaded “genre fiction” status, with its connotations of corsets, unfurling Nazi flags, the fetid smell of Victorian London — the dinner theater of literature, essentially. Notably, novels by women authors often transcended such categorization, including Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” (1987), Shirley Hazzard’s “The Great Fire” (2003), Pat Barker’s “Regeneration” trilogy (1991-95), Mary Renault’s novels set in ancient Greece, Octavia E. Butler’s fiction built on slave accounts and, of course, Penelope Fitzgerald’s strange and wonderful take on Novalis, “The Blue Flower” (1995). While national identity and the historical novel have long been bound up with one another — Sir Walter Scott’s swashbuckling Scottish romances, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s tales of Polish glory written during the country’s long partition, Tolstoy’s Napoleonic Wars-set “War and Peace” — they have also existed alongside a parallel speculative tradition. Even before Scott’s “Waverley,” published in 1814 and credited by the Marxist critic Gyorgy Lukacs as the first and most quintessential modern historical novel, authors — mostly women — were using historic settings, creating a kind of alternative history in which female characters have all the fun. The most remarkable is Sophia Lee’s 1783 novel “The Recess,” told from the perspective of the imagined twin daughters of Mary, Queen of Scots. Predictably, such novels were originally perceived as slight entertainments. Even the best-known work of this subgenre of feminist historical literature, Virginia Woolf’s modernist masterpiece “Orlando” (1928), with its gender-fluid heroine who doesn’t age from the 16th century to the 1920s, was critically dismissed as a lark. Woolf herself described the novel as “fun” and “fantasy,” but its bladed politics gleam all the more brilliantly today: It is a study of gender roles, of power and powerlessness, grounded in a character constrained neither by sex nor mortality — the dream of a life outside history. The publication of Hilary Mantel’s “Wolf Hall” in 2009, followed by its sequel, “Bring Up the Bodies,” in 2012 (Mantel is working on the third and final installment, “The Mirror and the Light”), was hailed as a genre-shattering moment: Here was a thoroughly contemporary and literary novel, with non-archaic dialogue, that happened to be cast with Tudors. Mantel’s genius for a history deeply known and lightly worn made the Tudors unaccountably gripping and proximate. But even before Mantel, cracks were already forming in the delineation between historical and literary novels. By the mid-1990s, authors like A.S. Byatt and Peter Carey, and later Sarah Waters and Ian McEwan, fascinated with the ways we access and reinvent the past, were elevating the genre’s status and making the novel’s trick of empathy all the more magical: How many book-club matrons have found themselves transfixed by Waters’s Victorian-era tales of lesbian love? Surely the most radical thing Mantel did was give a voice to Anne Boleyn, the mother of the Reformation, Elizabeth I and the centuries of English history that followed. In Mantel’s view, Boleyn is clever, lusty, maternal, stylish, prone to moments of temper and highhandedness and — fatally — overconfident in the stability of her position. In an afterword to “Bring Up the Bodies,” Mantel explains just how thin the record is on her. No transcript of her trial survives: Like so much of the female half of history, hers is a story of embarrassed erasure. IF WE’VE LEARNED nothing else from history, it’s that there’s no escaping it, and that moving on from it requires some honesty and truth telling. Suggesting a way forward is one of the more underread books of 2018, Apostol’s “Insurrecto,” a historical novel about the effort to do just that. It begins in the present, when a Filipina writer and translator, Magsalin, agrees to help a stylish, young Sofia Coppola-esque American director, Chiara, who is making a film about a forgotten 1901 atrocity in which American occupiers retaliated against a Filipino uprising. After Magsalin reads Chiara’s script, she writes one of her own, and soon we’re reading two competing versions of historical events — one from the perspective of a white American socialite photographer, the other from the point of view of a Filipina schoolteacher. In the end, both Magsalin and Chiara believe they have failed in telling a true account of the event — but Apostol has not. The United States may have “manufactured how to see the world,” as she puts it, but that’s changing now, as a new generation of writers and filmmakers and artists rewrite the old stories with skin very much in the game: a rebellion against history and memory. The process of remembering is, by definition, an act of imagination and invention, and the hardest stories to tell have become the stories we need most, those in which there is no tweetable takeaway — only the invisible dead, the ghosts who lie in wait.",The New York Times

2019,Why Are We So Freaking Tired?,"Feeling like a spit-up-covered bag of dirty laundry? It might be fragmented sleep. [Click here to get NYT Parenting in your inbox once a week.] When my younger daughter was around 18 months old, I asked my mom when I would stop feeling so tired. Like me, my mother had two kids about three years apart, and when I was born she was a doctor who worked full time, with a doctor husband who also worked full time. Even though my dad did 50 percent of the child care before it was cool, it’s family lore that the biggest fights they ever had were over who got to take the first nap on the weekends. When I asked my mom when I would be less exhausted, she paused, like she was doing complex mental calculations, and as my kids hurtled around my apartment, yelling, said, “Seven years.” Around that time, I went into my yearly medical check-up convinced I was anemic: There had to be some physical explanation for why I felt like a spit-up covered bag of dirty laundry all the time. But, as blood tests soon revealed, I was not anemic. In fact, I was in perfect health. One of our new guides to getting better sleep as a new parent explains why I might have been feeling so broken, despite sleeping seven or eight hours most nights: Apparently “fragmented sleep can leave you as tired as insufficient sleep.” Those early-morning requests for blanket-fixing and glasses of water were really taking their toll. Our experts suggest trying to get four to six hours of uninterrupted rest, because repeatedly waking during a single sleep cycle is bad for learning and memory. If you’ve got a newborn, and especially if you’re nursing, we know that four to six hours is a pipe dream. But sleep is really essential for postpartum mental health. So this is the piece of advice I give to all my friends right before they give birth: If you really feel like you’re on the brink, get an uninterrupted night of sleep by whatever means possible. For some new moms, that means pumping breast milk and actually physically leaving the house, because they know that if they’re at home they will want to tend to the baby. If it’s financially feasible, I even suggest finding a last-minute deal on a hotel room, pumping before you go and then swan diving into a bed that you don’t have to make yourself for one night. Other options include going to a friend or relative’s house and passing out in a guest bedroom, or even barricading yourself in your own bedroom and keeping the baby in the living room for the night with your partner, or a relative or pal. This advice also works for parents of older kids who just won’t go to sleep. We have another new guide this week that focuses on burnout. Before I started researching the topic, I thought burnout was all-encompassing — if you were burned out at home, you’d also be burned out at work outside the home. But parental burnout and work burnout are two separate phenomena with similar symptoms, which include persistent feelings of exhaustion. For the burnout guide, I spoke to Dr. Inger Burnett-Zeigler, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University, who recommends asking yourself this question if you feel like you’re at risk for parental burnout: “Do you actually have to do everything you think you have to do in this moment?” Sometimes taking 20 minutes to do something you find pleasurable, whether it’s watching trash TV, reading or talking to a friend, is a better use of your time than making something elaborate for preschool snack day.

Our friends at Smarter Living have tons of guidance for recognizing the signs of burnout at work and for remedying those issues. Recently, they also made the case for doing nothing, which is advice I can really get behind. A new longitudinal study of more than 4,600 German men and women published in the academic journal Sleep concluded: “In both women and men, sleep satisfaction and duration did not fully recover for up to six years after the birth of their first child.” So my mom’s “seven years” prediction was not that far off! Parenting can be a grind. So let’s celebrate the tiny victories. The baby was finally down, and my husband and I had some time to talk about topics other than sleeping and pooping, but I also needed to shower. Instead of cutting the conversation short, we took the rest of our bottle of wine into the bathroom, where we talked and drank while I showered. —Madeline Scheffler, Brooklyn, N.Y.

2019,Opinion | Why Barr Can’t Whitewash the Mueller Report,"We have a system in place for our government to uncover evidence against a sitting president. And it’s working. Mr. Katyal drafted the special counsel regulations under which Robert Mueller was appointed. Many who watched Attorney General William Barr’s testimony on Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which followed the revelation that the special counsel Robert Mueller had expressed misgivings about Mr. Barr’s characterization of his report, are despairing about the rule of law. I am not among them. I think the system is working, and inching, however slowly, toward justice. When it comes to investigating a president, the special counsel regulations I had the privilege of drafting in 1998-99 say that such inquiries have one ultimate destination: Congress. That is where this process is going, and has to go. We are in the fifth inning, and we should celebrate a system in which our own government can uncover so much evidence against a sitting president. Some commentators have attacked the special counsel regulations as giving the attorney general the power to close a case against the president, as Mr. Barr did with the obstruction of justice investigation into Donald Trump. But the critics’ complaint here is not with the regulations but with the Constitution itself. Article II gives the executive branch control over prosecutions, so there isn’t an easy way to remove the attorney general from the process. Instead, the idea behind the regulations was to say, “We recognize the constitutional reality that the attorney general controls the prosecution power, so what else can we do?” My colleagues and I (a group that included many career officials at the Justice Department as well as bipartisan leaders in the House and Senate) settled on two things. First, provide a mechanism to enable an independent investigation, and thereby generate public confidence in the outcome of that investigation. Second, design that mechanism so that if the attorney general interferes with the special counsel’s inquiry, that interference would be reported to Congress and ultimately become public. The underappreciated story right now is that we’ve not only learned that it was Mr. Barr — and pointedly not Mr. Mueller — who decided to clear President Trump of the obstruction charges, but also discovered the reasoning behind Mr. Barr’s decision. The American public and Congress now have the facts and evidence before them. The sunlight the regulations sought is shining. Mr. Barr tried to spin these facts. He hid Mr. Mueller’s complaints, which were delivered to him in writing more than a month ago, even when Congress asked in a previous hearing about complaints by members of the special counsel's team. And the four-page letter that Mr. Barr issued in March and supposedly described the Mueller report omitted the two key factors driving the special counsel’s decision (which were hard to miss, as they were on the first two pages of the report’s volume about obstruction): First, that he could not indict a sitting president, so it would be unfair to accuse Mr. Trump of crimes even if he were guilty as sin; and second, Mr. Mueller could and would clear a sitting president, but he did not believe the facts cleared the president. These two items came out because the special counsel regulations allowed for public release of this information (and not, as Mr. Barr testified on Wednesday, because he “overrode” the regulations to give the information to the public). The attorney general was misleading through and through, not just about the investigation, but about the special counsel regulations themselves. What’s more, we now know about Mr. Barr’s reasoning to clear the president, which turns out to be painfully thin. When asked on Wednesday why he did so, Mr. Barr said the Department of Justice ordinarily issues “binary” decisions: indict or not indict. But Mr. Barr’s own view is that this case is anything but ordinary, because the president cannot be indicted. If Mr. Trump were an “ordinary” individual, he’d almost surely be looking down the barrel of a federal indictment right now. So how can Mr. Barr now use the “ordinary” rules playbook? This mishmash of legal arguments is absurd. No responsible scholar who thinks a sitting president cannot be indicted also thinks an attorney general can try to truncate a process of oversight — by Congress, for example — by “pre-clearing” the president in advance. The whole idea behind the notion that a sitting president cannot be indicted is that the responsibility lies in Congress. An attorney general shouldn’t put his thumb on the scale one way or the other. That’s why Mr. Mueller’s predecessors, Kenneth Starr and Leon Jaworski, simply served the evidence up to Congress; they didn’t try to exonerate the president in advance of it. And that brings us full circle to the special counsel regulations. We knew when we drafted them that we could have a nefarious attorney general (though, in fairness, we didn’t predict this amount of duplicity). But we also knew that the facts would ultimately be forced out into public view under the regulations. That is why the special counsel isn’t a regular Justice Department employee. The “break glass in case of emergency” option was that if the attorney general was interfering with the work of the special counsel and preventing it from becoming public, the special counsel could leave the department and testify. Mr. Mueller needs to testify and tell us whether he disagrees with Mr. Barr’s analysis and conclusions about obstruction of evidence; what he thinks about the attorney general’s reaching his decision without reviewing any of the underlying evidence; what Mr. Mueller thought of Mr. Barr’s characterization of their reported disagreements; whether there were other disagreements that have not been reported; and whether Mr. Mueller’s knowledge of what Mr. Barr has done leads him to conclude that the attorney general must recuse himself from the continuing Trump investigations. Mr. Barr’s deeply evasive testimony on Wednesday necessitates and tees up a full investigation in Congress. Those who say Congress shouldn’t do so because surveys show that the American public is not in favor of an impeachment inquiry must take into account the fact that the American people have been misled by Attorney General Barr’s characterizations of the report and its conclusions. These surveys are therefore not surprising. But there is no more sacred duty for Congress than getting to the bottom of whether our president has taken care that the laws of this country have been faithfully executed. Neal K.

2019,"Why California Doesn’t Have 40 Million Residents, Yet","California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) In 2018, the Golden State grew by 186,807 people, according to data released by the state last week. That’s about two Los Angeles Memorial Coliseums, or almost 10 Oracle Arenas full of new Californians. Sounds like a lot, right? If you caught this Los Angeles Times headline, you already know the plot twist: That number actually represents the slowest growth in the state’s entire history, a meager 0.47 percent increase over the year before. It brought the state’s total population as of Jan. 1 to 39.9 million, just shy of the 40 million that Tina Daley, who heads demographic research for the state’s department of finance, told me that her office was tentatively predicting earlier this year. The anemic increase isn’t great; economists will tell you that a stagnant or declining work force makes it tough to sustain economic growth. But when I checked in with Ms. Daley again on Thursday, she said it wasn’t surprising. Ms. Daley said declining births and rising numbers of deaths aren’t new, as baby boomers age and young people around the world wait longer or decide not to have children. And the people who are moving to California, from other states and abroad, tend to have higher education levels, which is correlated with fewer births. Also, she said, high costs of living mean California has been losing residents to other states. [Read the full report here.] What was unexpected, Ms. Daley said, was the degree of slowing in migration from other countries. “What we’re seeing is it’s decreasing a little bit more than we had thought it would,” she said. Still, H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the department, emphasized that the slow growth should not be taken as a sign that the state can take its foot off the gas when it comes to housing development. The estimates showed the state netted just 77,000 new units, which falls far short of the 200,000 units the department estimated the state needs to add each year. It is also well below the pace that would be necessary to build the 3.5 million homes Gov. Gavin Newsom has said California needs by 2025. “The affordability issue is pervasive throughout the state, but particularly urban areas,” Mr. Palmer said. “We’ve been historically behind the curve in terms of keeping up with population growth.” And some communities are still growing relatively rapidly. Some of that can be traced to the devastation wrought by wildfires. Chico, for instance, was the state’s fastest-growing city with a population over 30,000 last year. It notched a 20.7 percent jump, largely because of an influx of displaced Paradise residents. But Ms. Daley noted that among the state’s 10 largest cities, the fastest growing were Sacramento, which grew by about 1.5 percent, with 7,400 new residents, and Bakersfield, which added 4,300 people for a 1.1 percent gain. That, she said, lines up with broader shifts in the state away from pricey coastal communities to less expensive inland cities.

2019,Why California’s Water Crisis Is So Difficult to Solve,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today delivered to your inbox.) When I was working for The Bakersfield Californian, I wrote about the woes of a tiny water company whose last well ran dry. Residents of the cluster of mobile homes the company served told me about bathing with baby wipes and being unable to flush the toilet without using up precious reserves. I remember being surprised that even in California, people lived without reliable access to water. That was in 2012. The issues that plagued that community had been building for decades before then, and, as my colleague Jose Del Real reports in a new story, they’ve since become even more urgent. Jose explained why: Nearly one million Californians are exposed to unsafe drinking water each year. And while California’s drinking water problems span the length of the state, about half of California’s failing water systems are concentrated in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley. The Valley’s farms feed the country, but it’s an unsettling reality that the low-income farmworkers who cultivate the crops live in conditions that have been likened to the developing world. A complicated web of factors contribute to the problem in the Central Valley: the heavy use of fertilizer in the area; the high concentration of dairy farms; the ruralness of the region itself, which makes broad infrastructure development difficult to finance; and the isolation of many communities that started as farm labor camps. While water experts and activists have long known about the problems, it has been difficult to garner attention outside of affected communities. “Most of the general public doesn’t really worry about water unless there’s something going on with their own water supply,” said Ellen Hanak, the director of the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California. Our reporting took us to East Orosi, a small unincorporated town of about 500 in Tulare County surrounded by orange fields, where the water that spews from the taps is tainted by fertilizer chemicals. There, Martha Sanchez and her family, who make their living picking oranges and cherries, have received notices not to use the water from the taps. Through a state grant, they received bottled water each month, but the heavy jugs are unwieldy and they always run out. “We complain, but it’s like nobody really cares,” said Ms. Sanchez. “We’re just a little town over here where there’s nothing.” This year there is a renewed sense of urgency among lawmakers in Sacramento to address the problem, but it’s proving difficult. And East Orosi is emblematic of many towns throughout the Central and Salinas Valleys. The town’s struggles with contaminated water are years old. Its neighboring town, Orosi, just one mile away, has clean drinking water, but consolidating water systems has proved difficult because of politics and money. Even if everything goes their way, residents of East Orosi may not have clean water flowing from their taps for years.

Now, scientists have used infrared imaging to learn more about just how precariously flakes are attached. One researcher who climbed El Capitan years ago said the work gave him a new appreciation of the experience. “When you’re standing on them, it’s really quite amazing to think that this is just perched on the side of El Capitan and for some reason it’s still there,” he said.

2019,Why Can’t Men Say ‘I Love You’ to Each Other?,"Modern Love College Essay Contest It doesn’t count if you add “bro” or “man” to the end. I’m having L-word troubles, but my troubles don’t involve a lover. There’s no romance or sex in this. No flowers, candles or dancing. My L-word troubles are with my boy, my best friend, Kichi. I’ve told him I love him probably five or six times now, but he never says it back. When people say, “I love you,” especially for the first time, there are a number of things they may be saying. Maybe it’s, “Do you love me?” (the question smuggled inside the confession), or, more urgently, “Please love me.” With Kichi, it’s not like that. I know he loves me. I feel it all the time. I don’t need to ask for his love. I don’t need to wonder. I tell him I love him for a simple reason: Nothing could be more true. But he doesn’t say it back. Mostly I’ve said it when we’re leaving each other, a couple of times over the phone, once when I was drunk, another time when he was hurt and I was trying to be supportive. There’s always silence for a moment, and then he says something like, “Yeah, bro, I’ll catch you soon.” I don’t need him to say those exact words to me. I wonder, though, about what keeps him from saying them. What keeps nearly all young men from being able to tell their male friends that they love them? When I was 8, I made my first best friend. Pedro was twig-thin, messy-haired and jittery, brimming with the kind of untamed tenderness found only in children. When I moved to Philadelphia, he took me — a nervous new boy at school — in his arms and under his wings. Pedro and I spent our weekends on walks with his mother through the forest trails near their house. He and I walked slowly, holding hands while we stepped, interlocking our fingers. To this day, whenever I participate in the sacred human practice of hand holding, I think of Pedro. On one of our walks, Pedro and I were interrupted by another boy, Pedro’s neighbor, who chopped his hand between ours, startling us. “You two hold hands?” he said. “That’s gay.” I remember not knowing exactly what “gay” meant, but sensing in the way other boys wielded the word that it meant something you didn't want to be. I had a terrible feeling that the outside world had broken into our quiet green place. Pedro and I never held hands again. He and I still cared for each other, but that day we learned our care was something we needed to regulate, subdue, place in a chokehold and never let loose. We learned this at the hands of another boy our age, who probably had learned it at the hands of another boy of whatever age. Pedro and I learned what men in America have learned repeatedly: that tenderness must be tamed in accordance with a set of codes we must become fluent in, as if our survival depends on it. This lesson is learned over many years, passed between generations, and like the best-taught lessons, it claws into you until you can hardly distinguish where the lesson ends and you begin. Somewhere inside each man is a list of all the other men he’s loved without ever finding the words to tell them so. I met Kichi in the middle of my freshman year, when I was once again a nervous new kid, this time throwing a party. I have gone through life with a rotating set of anxious tics. That year, I had become fond of swinging my university lanyard with my key in circles, wrapping and unwrapping it around my finger. When people started flowing into my dorm room, I began my nervous swinging, not noticing what I was doing until I heard a crack and saw that my key had struck a stranger’s iPhone screen, leaving a minor scratch. That stranger was Kichi. My first message to him was an apology, sent the next morning. He was kind and forgiving. We agreed to hang out. Freshman year is an easy time to attach to people. I started hanging out with Kichi more and more, almost every day, then several times a day. When it was time to choose housing for sophomore year, we decided to room together. We fell into each other’s lives quickly because we were both hungry for closeness in a new place. We stayed in each other’s lives because nothing has ever felt more natural. Kichi and I are both mixed race, with white mothers, immigrant fathers and hard-to-pronounce names. We are from cities — him Seattle, me Philadelphia — that we take pride in. But mostly, we are different. He’s calm, cool, rides a skateboard, keeps his clothes neatly folded, writes poems and loves immunology. When he’s sad, he doesn’t stay sad for long. I admire how quietly deliberate Kichi is and the balance he brings to his life. When I go to him with girlfriend problems, writing problems or any other kinds of problems, some little thing he says or notices always stays with me for days. I appreciate his steadiness, and he appreciates how emotional I am, how I’m rarely balanced or collected at all. How I’m messy and clumsy. As we became closer friends, I started taking some of him with me, and he started taking some of me with him. He appreciates the mess of me, which is maybe how I know that he loves me. What else is there to love, anyway? The codes men follow in love are tricky. For example, while saying a straight “I love you” is frowned upon, sometimes saying to another man “Much love” or “I got love for you” is O.K. “I love you” might even be passable if it is quickly followed by “bro” or “man.” These are the linguistic gymnastics masculinity asks us to perform, the negotiations we make through language to keep within the acceptable bounds of manhood. A footnote should be added to the code. Sometimes the most inconvenient or terrible circumstances can occasion an acceptable expression of love, but only at that moment, never to be spoken of again. Two years ago, Kichi and I took semesters off from college and spent that time in Colombia, where my father is from. One day, while in the coastal town of Capurganá, I got so suddenly sick with fever and dizziness that I dropped to my knees while walking on the beach. I was scared to be mysteriously ill in a place where I knew it could be hard to find help. Kichi searched all over town for a doctor. When he couldn’t find one, he decided his pre-med coursework would have to do, and he tended to me. He put his hand on my forehead. He whispered into my ear. He told me over and over that I was going to be O.K. — until I was. This was perhaps our most intimate moment, brought about by my sickness and unthinkable at any other time. This is the code, as intricate as it is far-reaching. Kichi and I do not possess the flagship qualities of masculine college boys. We aren’t in fraternities or on sports teams. We have even talked, more than once, about masculinity and the illogical things it requires of us. But still, we have lived in this world. We grew up as boys in America. We learned this code and we practice it. There’s no immunity. There’s a part of this story I haven’t admitted yet: Each time I say, “I love you” to Kichi, it feels uncomfortable. I feel the weirdness of it in myself. The lesson is burrowed in that deep. I hesitate, flinch. But in my conscious mind, I know it’s what I want to say, so I try to say it. I want to say “I love you” to Kichi and mean just that. I don’t want there to be any desire or questioning or expectation lurking inside my words. I want to love in a way that surpasses the need for affirmation, for return. This is what I have come to know as the purest kind of love: expecting nothing back. I remain hopeful. It’s not that I need to hear those words. I’m just ready to be free from all the forces, voices and gestures that keep us from saying them. Still, I can’t help but wish that one day Kichi will forgo all the masculine clatter, look me in the eyes and simply say “I love you, too.” Ricardo F.

2019,Why Do Israel and Gaza Keep Fighting? Because It’s in Their Leaders’ Interests.,"News Analysis JERUSALEM — More than two dozen people were killed and homes and businesses destroyed in the weekend’s fighting between Israel and Gaza, but on Monday leaders on both sides declared themselves satisfied with the outcome. The cycle of violence-ceasefire-repeat that keeps verging on all-out war may look like pointless destruction to the outside world. But analysts say it is amply serving the interests of the two main antagonists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel gets to batter Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, while bolstering his argument that the Palestinians are not ready for peace and that a two-state solution is impossible. Hamas, which sought and apparently received renewed assurances of a loosening of the Israeli blockade of Gaza, gets to show skeptical, impoverished Gaza residents that its strategy of armed resistance is working. The result is a strange kind of symbiosis. The relationship between Hamas and Israel is adversarial, to be sure: always bumpy, frequently deadly and fraught with risk that it could spiral into a protracted ground conflict, whether from a stray rocket that kills too many innocents or a shift in the political calculus on either side. It may prove an armistice slowly in the making — “a negotiation by fire,” as Ghaith al-Omari, a former Palestinian Authority official, described it. Or perhaps it is a form of détente, Middle East-style. But with each iteration of the cycle that does not lead to a conflagration, Israel and Hamas are serving one another’s purposes, and getting more and more used to doing business this way. The fighting over the weekend, the worst since a 50-day war in 2014, was at least the eighth round of brief fighting between Israel and Gaza over the past year, with battles sometimes lasting little more than a day. Each has ended quickly in a cease-fire, usually brokered by Egypt and seen as evidence that neither side wants a full-fledged war. Hamas has shown an ability to live up to its commitments: An important moment came at the end of March, when on the anniversary of demonstrations along the Gaza-Israel fence, Hamas deployed operatives in brightly colored vests to keep violence to a minimum, showing it could enforce a cease-fire, analysts said. But at other times, it can express its impatience with weapons. The weekend’s violence may have been fueled by a delay in the arrival of millions of dollars in Qatari cash to help pay the salaries of Gaza workers and by a perception that Israel was not following through quickly enough on other promises. Some of the clashes since last summer, meanwhile, have been interpreted as attempts by Hamas leaders to seek a better deal. “They have a tendency to try and stretch the terms and improve what they’re getting by flexing their muscles,” said Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. For Israel’s government, its management of the Hamas relationship is fraught with contradiction and the need for careful balancing. Seeing Hamas as a terrorist organization bent on Israel’s annihilation, the Israeli government has no interest in lending Hamas legitimacy or allowing it to gather strength. But Mr. Netanyahu also has shown little appetite for destroying Hamas — despite the calls of some right-wing politicians to do just that — because of what Aaron David Miller, a veteran Middle East negotiator for the United States, called “the day-after problem”: Israel would have to reoccupy Gaza with its own troops, taking full responsibility for its two million inhabitants. There is also a risk that a group even more radical than Hamas could seize power, like Palestinian Islamic Jihad, already a potent rival of Hamas in Gaza, or perhaps elements of the Islamic State operating in the Sinai Desert. That problem is why Mr. Netanyahu appears to have the support of Israel’s security establishment in his management of Gaza. His political opponents have assailed him for allowing the situation to fall into the current pattern but have not said what they would do differently. And Israelis appear to be showing greater tolerance for casualties than in the past. In Ashkelon on Sunday, survivors of a rocket attack on a factory that killed one of their co-workers expressed unflinching support for Mr. Netanyahu, though they also blamed world opinion for preventing the army from dealing Gaza the blow it deserved. “They should hit hard,” Menashe Babikov, 42, a manager from Ashdod, said of Israel’s armed forces, but they would not “because they are scared of what the world will say.” Hamas also serves another function for the Netanyahu government, analysts say. With the Palestinian Authority governing the West Bank and Hamas in charge of Gaza, there is no easy path to a two-state solution to the conflict, which Mr. Netanyahu is widely believed to oppose. Unifying the two factions — which the United States, Egypt and other international players spent months trying to do before giving up last year — would inevitably revive talk of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Miller said. “As long as you have a three-state reality, you cannot have a two-state solution,” he said. “Hamas is Netanyahu’s insurance policy.” Here, too, Israeli opponents of a two-state solution share common ground with Hamas, which also wants a single state, if not the one those Israelis seek. For Hamas, a brokered, back-channel negotiation over security, economic and humanitarian aid is workable, but abandoning its ideology of armed resistance for peace talks with Israel is a nonstarter. “From a Hamas point of view, it is better to have a government like we have than a more moderate one that aspires to advance the peace process,” said Celine Touboul, a Gaza expert at Israel’s Economic Cooperation Foundation. “Because once you do that, you advance the P.A.,” she said, referring to the Palestinian Authority. “And this is the thing that, deep down, matters the most to Hamas: that in that political competition, they will weaken the P.A. as much as possible.” For Hamas, the longer a Gaza cease-fire the better, said Mr. Yaari, who has reported on the Palestinians for Israeli television for many years. It needs to replenish its rocket and missile arsenal and rebuild or replace the many military and intelligence installations Israel has destroyed. “Every time, it’s costing them,” he said. But Mr. Yaari also said that the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, has wanted to refocus the organization’s energy on improving conditions there in part to buy time, to see what happens with the Palestinian Authority when the Trump administration discloses its vision for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and as the authority’s aged president, Mahmoud Abbas, declines in health. “Sinwar’s approach is to arrest the deterioration in Gaza,” Mr. Yaari said. “The price will be an extended cease-fire, and in two or three years we’ll see what’s next.” Mr. Abbas could be gone by then. Or Israel and the Palestinian Authority could well be on a collision course, he said, especially if Mr. Netanyahu follows through on an election-eve promise to annex some West Bank settlements as part of Israel. Either development, Mr. Yaari said, could create an opening for Hamas to try to gain the upper hand against the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. “Sinwar is saying, ‘My real priority is the West Bank,’” he said. For now, that dynamic makes Hamas a reliable adversary. Oddly enough, Ms. Touboul said, Mr. Netanyahu is “looking to Hamas as a more credible partner than the P.A.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Do We Let Political Parties Act Like Monopolies?,"When I ran against an incumbent senator, I learned the hard way how well insiders stack primaries against challengers. Mr. Dodson ran against Senator John Barrasso in the Republican Senate primary in Wyoming last year. When Senator Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, announced his retirement this month after four terms in the Senate, he set off a wave of political speculation similar to what we might expect from the retirement of a Supreme Court justice. After all — they’re both lifetime appointments. This isn’t literally true, of course, but it might as well be. Protecting incumbents from their voters is one thing the Democrats and Republicans can still agree on. Through a series of anticompetitive tactics, the two political parties have created a hidden monopoly structure that accounts for a Congress with a 77 percent disapproval rating yet a nearly 90 percent re-election rate. Challenging Senator John Barrasso last year in the Republican primary, I saw how this works first hand. When I tried to hire the law firm to which I’d directed millions of dollars in business while I was a chief executive, it turned me away, explaining that it could work only for Democrats. When I contacted a law firm known to serve Republicans, that firm told me it couldn’t work for a candidate running against an incumbent because it would put its entire practice at risk. As I tried to build an organization to run a credible primary challenge, this story repeated itself, whether I was recruiting campaign staff or a marketing firm. Our political parties have a distinct distaste for competition. So it was no surprise to me when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez disclosed an internal memo from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee making it clear the committee would blacklist any companies that do business with candidates challenging incumbents in the 2020 primaries. “Our job is to support incumbents,” the committee chairman wrote. None of this is news to political insiders. In 2013, the National Republican Senatorial Committee openly blacklisted an advertising firm for working with a Republican group that targeted Senator Mitch McConnell in a primary challenge. The committee’s spokesman was admirably direct: “We’re not going to do business with people who profit off attacking Republicans in primaries.” If you make a living serving candidates in elections, you do as they say because you can’t afford to be blackballed. During the 2018 midterms the parties spent nearly $2.5 billion. They even use legislation to ensure their advantage. In 2014 Congress voted to cap individual contributions to a federal PAC at $5,000, but then, in an astonishing act of self-dealing, gave the PACs run by the two political parties — and only those PACs — a $106,500 limit, money they could divvy up however they choose. To the political parties, competition at the polls, where the best person wins, is not part of American democracy — not when they have incumbents to protect. The parties routinely impose restrictions on the consultants, fund-raisers and accounting firms on which challengers like myself depend to mount a realistic campaign. And because this behavior is intended to eliminate competition, in any other industry it would land the political parties in antitrust court. I am hardly alone in my frustration. Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, and his colleague Katherine Gehl, argue that the root cause of our dysfunctional political system is the stifling of competition. In a book to be published this year, “The Politics Industry,” they apply tools for understanding industry competition to politics. “The problem is not the existence of political parties, per se, or that there are two major parties,” Ms. Gehl said. “The real problem is the nature of political competition that the current duopoly has created.” The monopolistic tactics our political parties employ extend well beyond restricting access to their suppliers. Much as monopolists in the private sector check access to customers and capital, the political parties also limit access to voters and funding. For example, in my own campaign, the Republican Party invited all primary candidates to attend a Reagan Day dinner, but then allowed only the incumbent, Mr. Barrasso, to address the audience. When I complained to the party chairman, I was told there was nothing he could do. Not only do challengers like me have no access to that $2.5 billion war chest, but prominent Republican donors explicitly told me they couldn’t contribute to my campaign and risk their donation showing up in public records, for fear of retribution by the party. As Ms. Gehl and Mr. Porter helped me see, the primary system isn’t broken; by restricting access to suppliers, customers and capital, it functions exactly as intended — to protect the monopoly player. The political parties understand that in a political world made up mainly of partisan-drawn districts, where 90 percent of the seats in Congress are not competitive in the general election, controlling the primary process protects incumbents and controls the ultimate outcome. Monopolies don’t restrict competition with noticeable barriers because that’s how they get caught. Instead, they hide 1,000 bear traps in the grass, rendering a successful challenge too unlikely for competitors to bother. With 96 percent of the film market in the mid-1950s, Kodak used its market power to bundle the cost of developing photos into the price of the film, making it more expensive to process the film of a competitor. In the ’90s, Microsoft didn’t make it impossible to use Netscape Navigator; it just made sure you never saw the browser on your PC by installing only Internet Explorer on Windows machines. The average users, newer to computers, never realized they had a choice. Ms. Gehl and Mr. Porter argue that these anti-competitive tactics explain the disconnect between our opinion of Congress and our behavior at the polls. We re-elect incumbents not because we approve of them, but because they have no serious competition. What I learned in grade-school civics is that democracy works when our representatives are accountable to the voters. The insight I gained running for office is that the partisan primary makes them anything but. Political parties have hijacked our elections and our representatives, making representatives accountable not to voters but to the party and its donors. Fortunately, there are three structural solutions that, if voters are prepared to insist on change, will remove the power of those 1,000 hidden bear traps. First, to wrest control from one dominant political party, nonpartisan committees must take control of the taxpayer-financed primary process and run a single primary ballot, forcing incumbents to compete with members of the opposing party as well as of their own party. Second, we should institute federal term limits, which would break incumbents’ stranglehold on office, create more open seats and attract new talent to the political process. Finally, we need a constitutional amendment against partisan gerrymandering so that voters choose their politicians instead of politicians choosing their voters. The lesson I learned from Ms. Gehl and Mr. Porter is that the monopolistic forces I witnessed are not inevitable. The solution is to restore congressional accountability to where it belongs, with voters. Just as our economic engine relies on competition to remain healthy, so does our democracy.

2019,Why Do You Grab Your Bag When Running Off a Burning Plane?,"news analysis As passengers fled a burning plane in Moscow, some stopped to get their luggage. Don’t be too quick to judge. A senior editor on the International desk of The Times. Imagine trying to get out of a plane, but the passenger ahead of you is blocking the aisle as he tries to wrestle his carry-on free. Frustrating, right? And, oh — did we mention that the plane is on fire? After an Aeroflot jetliner burst into flames during an emergency landing in Moscow recently, some passengers who had just escaped were seen walking across the tarmac luggage in hand. It raised a rather basic question about human behavior: Why would anyone evacuating a plane waste precious moments retrieving his Sudoku book and suitcase? The online hate was instant, if based on sketchy information. The carry-on grabbers were accused of having hindered the escape of fellow passengers, dozens of whom died in the flames. No one may ever know how true that is, but the passengers did violate one of the most basic rules of air safety. As a headline in the Travel section of The Times put it after the accident, In the Event of an Emergency, Leave Your Luggage on the Plane. Really. Psychologists caution, though, against being too quick to judge. That guy in front of you who enters the subway — then stops dead and looks at his phone? He probably is a jerk. That passenger reaching for the bag with his favorite sweater or maybe a present for his kid? He’s probably just acting human. Decisions made in moments of intense emotion are often the least rational, said Debra Borys, a forensic and clinical psychologist in Los Angeles. And it surely does not get more intense than it was for the passengers on Aeroflot Flight 1492 last Sunday. “They’re feeling so utterly terrified and powerless,” Dr. Borys said. It may also not be quite accurate, she said, to view the passengers’ actions as a conscious choice. “I don’t think we should think of it as a decision when they grab their stuff,” she said. “I think we should think about it as an impulse.” The goal may not have been safeguarding possessions; they may simply have been seeking a little emotional comfort. A newly minted expert on how people on a burning plane behave made a similar point. “I don’t know how the mind works in these situations,” Mikhail Savchenko, an Aeroflot passenger who took a video after escaping the plane that showed people carrying luggage, wrote on Facebook. “It’s a question for experts. It’s possible that many simply snap, and go on automatic. I don’t know.” Watching from the safety of your phone, as an armchair disaster observer, it’s easy to think you would never act so unwisely, but grabbing for possessions is more common than one might think. Passengers who have just deplaned via an escape slide have often been seen wheeling luggage away from the scene — as if their aircraft had just sidled into the gate and their only concern was finding the nearest Starbucks. “We have in the past publicly commented on the need for passengers to leave carry-on items behind during an emergency,” said Christopher O’Neil, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. “Seconds count during an emergency evacuation. The seconds wasted looking for and carrying items could be the difference between life and death.” In an advisory several years ago, the Federal Aviation Administration put it bluntly: “Passengers are expected to evacuate an airplane within 90 seconds. You do not have time to grab your luggage or personal items.” Unpredictable behavior in traumatic situations is hardly limited to air disasters. Dr. Metin Basoglu, a psychiatrist at the Istanbul Center for Behavior Research and Therapy, has seen it in victims of earthquakes and trauma. One man was so afraid during an interrogation that he did not understand the question when the police asked his name, and so did not answer. That earned him a beating. “Such can be the extent of cognitive disorientation during extreme fear,” Dr. Basoglu said in an email. “I would guess that the people in the airplane who took their bags were simply engaging in automatic or habitual behavior — the only type of behavior available to execute in a state of confusion.” Lee Clarke, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University, said that people often acted irrationally in emergency situations, but that it was the exception. “By and large,” he said, “people do the sensible thing.” And more often than not, he noted, as when earthquakes hit, people put their own safety at risk to help strangers. For his part, Mr. Savchenko declined to condemn his fellow passengers. “God is their judge,” he wrote on Facebook. “But I really don’t want to ask anyone to persecute them. I’m sure that this is very difficult for them now. I don’t think that even one person is burning in hell for taking out a suitcase deliberately, in cold blood.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Opinion | Why Does Apple Control Its Competitors?,"Regulators should take a close look at the iPhone App Store. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Of the 17 most popular screen-time and parental-control apps in the App Store, 11 have been removed or restricted by Apple. The app makers believe they are being punished for competing with Apple’s own screen-time control tools, or worse, for weaning people off Apple devices. Many of the apps had more stringent controls than Apple’s in-house alternatives. Apple says that the applications — specifically, the parental-control apps — were removed because of their use of Mobile Device Management, a technology that gave third parties access to information such as “user location, app use, email accounts, camera permissions and browsing history.” In other words, Apple says it removed the apps to protect the privacy of the children and parents who installed them. The actions by Apple highlight the inherent tension in the company’s fierce control over its mobile operating system: On the one hand, the closed environment is a boon to consumer privacy because the company has the leverage to insist upon it; on the other hand, that environment fosters a kind of monopoly. [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.] This isn’t the first time that the company has cracked down on products sold in its App Store. In January, the company revoked Facebook’s control over an app that collected data on minors, which temporarily resulted in havoc at Facebook headquarters, since the revocation applied to several custom-made apps (like calendars) used internally within the company. Apple’s caution around Mobile Device Management is reasonable — in a post-Cambridge Analytica world, third parties need not have overbroad access to user information. But Apple’s management of the App Store is also dangerously reminiscent of the anti-competitive behavior that triggered United States v. Microsoft, a landmark antitrust case that changed the landscape of the tech industry. In the mid-1990s, Microsoft began to bundle its Internet Explorer browser with Windows, moving to elbow competing browsers — primarily, Netscape — out of the picture. This triggered a lawsuit from the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general in 1998. Microsoft ultimately lost. The lawsuit is credited with opening up the marketplace for upstarts like Google and Facebook. Now, the companies that shot up to the top while Microsoft was busy fending off the Justice Department are engaging in similar anti-competitive tactics. In some ways, Microsoft’s conduct was more egregious than Apple’s appears to be today — internal documents outlined a clear strategy to “leverage” Windows to increase Internet Explorer’s market share and ultimately dominate the browser market. The company also entered into agreements with various service providers to optimize sites for Internet Explorer but not other browsers. Yet Microsoft never banned the installation of other browsers outright — how could it? If a user wanted to, they could still use Netscape. But Apple’s operating system for mobile devices makes it almost impossible to get an app outside of the App Store that will work on an Apple phone. Ultimately, the company controls what a user can or cannot do on their own iPhone. Apple also takes up to a 30 percent cut of in-app revenue, including revenue from “services” fulfilled in-app — like buying a premium subscription or an ebook. Because all apps go through the App Store, this 30 percent cut is nearly unavoidable. Apple doesn’t ban apps like Amazon Kindle or Spotify, which compete with Apple Books and Apple Music, respectively. But the 30 percent fee still stings. That’s the reason you currently can’t buy a Kindle ebook through the Kindle mobile app. Spotify, a much smaller company, now pays Apple between 15 and 30 percent of its in-app revenue in order to serve streaming music to its premium subscribers. Spotify recently filed a complaint with European regulators, accusing Apple of anticompetitive practices. In the United States, an antitrust lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court alleges that the 30 percent cut drives up prices for consumers. Apple isn’t the only company leveraging a mobile operating system for an unfair advantage. Last year, the European Union fined Google $5.1 billion for bundling the Chrome browser and Google Search with other Android apps. Even if we take Apple at its word that it was only protecting the privacy and security of its users by removing screen-time and parental-control apps, the state of the app marketplace is troubling. Why is a company — with no mechanism for democratic oversight — the primary and most zealous guardian of user privacy and security? Why is one company in charge of vetting what users can or cannot do on their phones, especially when that company also makes apps that compete in a marketplace that it controls? Senator Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to bar Apple from competing in its own app marketplace is too drastic, and doesn’t take into consideration how intertwined the physical phone is with Apple’s in-house apps. For example, iMessage competes with Facebook’s WhatsApp and Google Hangouts, but what’s a cellphone without text messages? Still, the status quo is untenable. It’s time for American regulators to take a good hard look at app stores and mobile operating systems. It might be time for another United States v. Microsoft.

2019,Why Does a Bucks Security Guard Look Familiar? He Used to Play for the Team,"MILWAUKEE — Dick Garrett is not the type of person who draws attention to himself. Co-workers at Bucks games have gone entire seasons without realizing his special connection to the team. Even some of the regulars who sit in the section of the arena where he works security are oblivious. So when Peter Feigin became the team president in 2014, he only got to know Garrett in his role as one of the franchise’s more beloved employees, largely because Garrett never talked much about himself. But a few months into Feigin’s tenure, the Bucks organized a dinner for former players, and Garrett showed up. “Dick,” Feigin recalled asking him, “what are you doing here?” At the time, Feigin was embarrassed. Perhaps he should have known that Garrett played for the Bucks the last time they went to the N.B.A. finals, in 1974. Or that he was once named to the N.B.A.’s All-Rookie team with the Los Angeles Lakers. Or that he had an eventful five-year career. But Feigin said he also came to realize that it was entirely in character for Garrett to keep his story quiet. Whenever people ask him about his days in the N.B.A., Garrett usually says something like, “Oh, I used to play some ball.” He is more likely to talk about his family, or his golf game, or the 28 years he spent selling beer for Miller. Garrett, 72, still loves basketball, though, which is why he has kept his part-time gig at home games here — 18 years and counting. “I get the same feeling every time I walk into the gym,” he said, “until my old body says, ‘Oh, wait a minute.’” [Keeping Score: Brook Lopez gets a lot of attention for his 3-pointers. He should get more for his defense.] His job is really a blend — part crowd control, part ambassador, part usher, part fan. It has been an exceptional season for the Bucks, who are set to host the Toronto Raptors on Friday night in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals. Garrett will be there, too, parked in a folding chair in front of section 108, where he will monitor fan behavior, help people find their seats, greet old friends, pose for a picture or two (he does get recognized on occasion) and cheer for the Bucks, who have a 1-0 series lead after winning Wednesday’s opener, 108-100. He always cheers for the Bucks. “Well, we’re not supposed to,” he said. “But there’s no way I’m just going to sit there.” The job gets him out of the house and keeps him connected to the game. He has seen plenty of basketball over the years — some good, some bad. But he has been especially grateful for his front-row seat for the evolution of Giannis Antetokounmpo. Garrett sensed from Antetokounmpo’s early days that he would be a remarkable player; he always arrived hours before games to work on his skills. “And working hard,” Garrett said. Garrett, who has a salt-and-pepper mustache and an easy smile, could have been speaking from experience. He and his wife, Penny, were married his senior year at Southern Illinois, and she was pregnant with their first child when the Lakers selected Garrett in the second round of the 1969 draft. A friend knocked on the door of their mobile home near campus to deliver the news. “Dick was a solid player,” Wayne Embry, the longtime N.B.A. executive, said in a telephone interview. “Nothing flashy. Terrific defender. And he saw the whole court.” A 6-foot-3 combo guard, Garrett crammed a lot of action (and some notable supporting roles) into his N.B.A. career. As a rookie in 1969-70, he averaged 11.6 points a game and started for the Lakers alongside the likes of Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor. The Lakers faced the Knicks in the N.B.A. finals, and Garrett often matched up against Walt Frazier, his former college teammate. Garrett played him tough through the first six games. Then came Game 7 at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks’ injured Willis Reed famously emerged from a courtside tunnel with his right thigh bandaged up. Garrett picked up three early fouls, and Frazier finished with 36 points and 19 assists as the Knicks won their first championship. “He just kind of went a little wild on me,” Garrett said. Garrett spent the next three seasons with the Buffalo Braves, a cellar-dwelling expansion franchise, before joining the Knicks for the start of the 1973-74 season. The Knicks had signed Garrett to help fill in while Earl Monroe was injured, then released him when Monroe returned. Garrett eventually landed with the Bucks, who advanced to the finals behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. The series, though, left Garrett with mixed feelings. He played sparingly as the Bucks lost to the Boston Celtics in seven games. And after a couple of deals fell through for the following season, he took a job in insurance. He had a young family, and playing in the N.B.A. was not yet particularly lucrative. Still, he had to cope with the fact that his pro career was finished — almost overnight. “For a couple of years, I was kind of bitter about it,” he said. “But then I realized, life is too short to be angry and bitter all the time. I told myself, ‘Suck it up, Dick. Go to work, son. Be happy. Life goes on.’ And I know I was fortunate, because I’ve got a lot of friends who never made it as far as I did.” Garrett fed his competitive drive by obliterating opponents in recreational leagues around Milwaukee. He recalled one winter when he played for a team that won about 59 games out of 60. He also made cameos at Bucks practices. Don Nelson, then the team’s coach, summoned Garrett whenever he needed an extra body, and Garrett always felt as if he held his own. Looking back, he said, he should have been more vocal about angling for a comeback. “I should have told Nellie, ‘I’m available!’ ” Garrett said. “But you just don’t know. Plus, I was doing O.K. I was working, and I was happy with my kids.” By then, Garrett was raising four children with his wife and working as an account representative for Miller. He loved dealing with people — still does — and that was a big part of the job. Besides, he says, if you can’t sell Miller products in Milwaukee, where the company was founded, you might as well find a different line of work. Garrett was doing well in sales when one of his bowling buddies asked if he would be interested in moonlighting at Bucks games. Garrett put it off for a couple of years before he reached out. “I said, ‘O.K., I’m ready,’ ” Garrett said. In the nearly two decades since, he has rarely missed a home game. Malcolm Morgan, the event security supervisor for Fiserv Forum, said the job belongs to Garrett for as long as he wants it. “You better believe it,” Morgan said. “The guy is a blessing.” Garrett did get a couple of nights off a few years ago so he could sit in the stands and watch his son Diante play for the Utah Jazz and the Phoenix Suns when they rolled through town. “That was a real thrill,” Garrett said. (Diante now plays pro basketball in Turkey.) Garrett and his wife celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary last September, but they also suffered a loss over the winter when their daughter Jermia died from a severe asthma attack. It has been a difficult time for the family. Coming to the arena, Garrett said, has helped in some small way. “I needed something to keep me busy,” he said, “and basketball was there for me.” So Garrett keeps showing up in his team-issue blazer, relishing his modest role, same as ever. Sometimes, he said, a fan will recognize him from the old days and ask him a question: You played ball, Dick! Why are you down there doing that? “And they must think this is somehow beneath me,” he said. “But I’ve also got 100 people coming up to me: ‘How do I get that job?’ Listen, I’m at an N.B.A. game, on the floor, watching the best players in the world. And getting paid for it!”",The New York Times
2019,Why Does a Student Protest Held a Century Ago Still Matter in China?,"BEIJING — Thousands of Chinese students took to the streets in Beijing 100 years ago Saturday, in a famous uprising against Western colonialism that still resonates today. The protest became known as the May 4 Movement, a pivotal moment in Chinese history that the national leader, Xi Jinping, this week commemorated by praising patriotism and urging Chinese youth to “obey the party and follow the party.” Here is why the movement matters, and why both supporters and critics of the Communist Party claim inspiration from it. [Read about how Mr. Xi hailed the historic revolt but warned students not to get any ideas.] China had sided with the Allies in the First World War, and many Chinese expected that negotiators in the postwar peace talks would agree to hand back colonial territory in Shandong, an eastern Chinese province, that Japan had seized from Germany near the start of the war. Instead, the Western powers let Japan keep the territory. That decision ignited fury among Chinese students, who saw it as a betrayal by Western nations and by China’s leaders, whom they accused of bowing to Japan. Anger spread in universities and colleges across Beijing, and on May 4, 1919, students from 13 campuses in the capital came together in protest. About 3,000 students joined the demonstration near Tiananmen, the “Gate of Heavenly Peace.” The students marched off to present their demands to Western diplomatic legations nearby. Protesters moved on to the home of Cao Rulin, one of the ministers they accused of acceding to Japan’s demands, and some ransacked and burned it. Some protesters were arrested. But the upsurge in nationalism spread to other cities in China, inspiring strikes and boycotts. The unrest forced the government in Beijing to release arrested students, and Chinese negotiators in Paris refused to sign the peace treaty. “May 4” entered history as a watershed for China. China’s ruling Communist Party is usually quick to squelch protests, so it might seem unusual for it to mark the anniversary of a student demonstration. But the 1919 protest is different and distant enough that Chinese leaders have made it part of their cycle of significant anniversaries. The May 4 protest became part of the party’s founding story. After Western powers ignored China’s pleas in 1919, more students and scholars looked to Russia’s Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 as a promising path toward national renewal. Some embraced Marxism and helped to found China’s Communist Party in 1921, and May 4 has entered the party’s iconography, celebrated on the Monument to the People’s Heroes that stands on Tiananmen Square. Since Mr. Xi became chairman of the party in 2012, he has promoted a nationalist vision of making China a more prosperous and powerful country and restoring it to its ancient glory. The party has cast itself as the rightful heir to the patriotic legacy of May 4 as one way to strengthen its legitimacy. There are other ways of remembering May 4 that stray beyond the party’s script. Successive generations of student protesters and dissenting intellectuals have also claimed inspiration from the May 4 era, including the students who occupied Tiananmen Square in June of 1989 to demand cleaner, more accountable government. Back in 1919, commentators linked the protests with the New Culture Movement, the name they gave to a flux of ideas that had spread in Chinese universities, newspapers and literary circles. Such ideas included anarchism, socialism, feminism, artistic experimentation and reforming written Chinese, said Elisabeth Forster, a lecturer in modern Chinese history at the University of Southampton who has written about the May 4 period and its myths. This iconoclastic spirit was summed up at the time in a slogan calling for “Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy.” The idea of science “then stood for ‘modernity’, the ‘West’ and a generally distanced and iconoclastic way of approaching Chinese tradition,” Ms. Forster said. “1919 really was a year that changed China.” So the New Culture and May 4 movements have both been evoked by Chinese scholars and students as lodestars for intellectual independence and enlightenment. “May 4 cannot be put to rest because the question is still screaming out: can you have science, technology and wealth without democracy?” said Vera Schwarcz, a professor of Chinese history at Wesleyan University.",The New York Times
2019,Why Eating Processed Foods Might Make You Fat,"People who followed a diet of ultra-processed foods ate about 500 more calories a day compared to when they ate a whole foods diet. In recent years, many nutrition experts have linked the obesity epidemic to the spread of ultra-processed foods that are engineered to have a long shelf life and irresistible combinations of salt, sugar, fat and other additives. These foods tend to make people overeat because they are full of refined carbohydrates, added sugars and fat that appeal to the human palate, experts say. Most of these foods, however, tend to lack fiber, protein, vitamins and other important nutrients. Now a small but rigorous new study provides strong evidence that not only do these foods tend to make people eat more, but they also may result in dramatic and relatively rapid weight gain and have other detrimental health effects. The research, published Thursday in the journal Cell Metabolism, found that people ate significantly more calories and gained more weight when they were fed a diet that was high in ultra-processed foods like breakfast cereals, muffins, white bread, sugary yogurts, low-fat potato chips, canned foods, processed meats, fruit juices and diet beverages. These foods caused a rise in hunger hormones compared to a diet that contained mostly minimally processed foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, grilled chicken, fish and beef, and whole grains, nuts and seeds. The subjects were recruited by scientists at the National Institutes of Health and assigned to live in a research facility for four weeks. There they were fed both diets — a whole foods diet or an ultra-processed one, along with snacks in each category — for two weeks each and carefully monitored. They were instructed to consume as much or as little as desired. The most striking finding was that the ultra-processed diet led the subjects to consume 500 extra calories a day — the amount in two and a half Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts — which resulted in an average of two pounds of weight gain in two weeks. Almost all of the extra calories they ate were from carbs and fat. “It’s a substantial amount of calories, and it did translate over a relatively short period of time into some substantial weight and body fat changes,” said Kevin Hall, the lead author of the study and an obesity expert at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. “I was surprised by the magnitude of the changes we saw.” Barry Popkin, a global obesity and nutrition expert at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was not involved in the study, called the research impressive and said that the weight gained on the ultra-processed diet in a short period of time was “profound.” He said that the new findings, along with previous studies, raise questions about whether food manufacturers can create healthier processed foods that do not induce people to overeat. “This is a very important study and a major challenge to the global food industry and the food science profession,” Dr. Popkin said. The new study, the first clinical trial to directly compare how ultra-processed foods and unprocessed foods influence health, could have important implications. Ultra-processed foods make up more than half of the calories that Americans consume, and they are becoming increasingly widespread across the globe as multinational food companies push deeper into developing countries. While there are many ways to define ultra-processed foods, they are typically packaged or fast foods that contain many ingredients, such as added sugars, refined carbohydrates, industrial oils, sodium and synthetic flavors and preservatives. Observational studies of thousands of people have found that eating high amounts of these foods is associated with a greater likelihood of early death from heart disease and cancer. But people in lower socioeconomic brackets tend to consume the most ultra-processed foods. They also tend to smoke more, exercise less and engage in other unhealthy behaviors. As a result, large population studies cannot entirely separate the effects of eating ultra-processed foods from other lifestyle factors that influence disease risk. The new study was designed to get around this problem by recruiting healthy adults whose average age was 31 and assigning them to eat both an unprocessed and an ultra-processed diet. The number of people in the study was necessarily small — 20 men and women — because the subjects had to spend four weeks living in a research facility eating only their prescribed diets. The researchers prepared all their meals and snacks, tracked every morsel of food that they ate, and carefully analyzed the effects of those foods on their weight, body fat, hormones and other biomarkers. The researchers wanted to make sure that the processed diet did not contain only obvious junk foods. So they served many highly processed foods that a typical American might eat daily and potentially even consider nutritious, like Cheerios, blueberry muffins and orange juice for breakfast; cheese and turkey sandwiches with baked Lay’s potato chips and diet lemonade for lunch; and steak, canned corn, mashed potatoes from a packet, and a diet beverage at dinner. On the processed diet, the subjects were also offered snacks like low-fat chips, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and other packaged foods typically found in vending machines. The researchers designed the two diets so that they contained roughly equivalent amounts of calories, carbs, fat and sugar. But the subjects were allowed to eat as much as they wanted, and they ended up consuming more calories from the meals when they were given the processed food diet. And the sources of those macronutrients were very different. On the unprocessed diet, the subjects got their fiber, sugar and carbs from fresh produce, beans, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, grains and other whole foods. On the ultra-processed diet they ate mostly refined carbs and added sugars found in bread, bagels, juices, tater tots, sauces, chips, pasta, French fries and canned foods. The subjects were given fiber supplements on the processed diet because those foods are typically low in fiber. The subjects spontaneously ate a lot more calories on the processed diet and, not surprisingly, gained weight. On the unprocessed diet, they consumed far fewer calories and lost weight. An analysis of their hormone levels seemed to indicate why: On the unprocessed diet, their levels of the appetite-suppressing hormone PYY increased while levels of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates hunger, fell. Dr. Hall and his colleagues are planning follow-up studies to examine why the ultra-processed foods had this effect. He pointed out that one thing many popular diets have in common, whether the diet is low-carb, plant-based, vegan, Paleo or high-protein, is that people who follow them often cut back on ultra-processed foods. However, Dr. Hall cautioned against demonizing processed foods, because many Americans depend on them: Ultra-processed foods are cheap, convenient and long lasting. The unprocessed diet used in the study, for example, cost 40 percent more than the ultra-processed diet. “We’re talking about foods that make up more than 50 percent of people’s diets, and they can be very attractive to people who have limited time, money, skills and access to ingredients that they can use to make meals from scratch,” he said. “For people who are working two jobs just to make ends meet and have a family to feed, a frozen pizza looks very good at the end of the day.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Fiction Trumps Truth,"The big ideas: What Is Power? We humans know more truths than any species on earth. Yet we also believe the most falsehoods. Mr. Harari is a historian. Many people believe that truth conveys power. If some leaders, religions or ideologies misrepresent reality, they will eventually lose to more clearsighted rivals. Hence sticking with the truth is the best strategy for gaining power. Unfortunately, this is just a comforting myth. In fact, truth and power have a far more complicated relationship, because in human society, power means two very different things. On the one hand, power means having the ability to manipulate objective realities: to hunt animals, to construct bridges, to cure diseases, to build atom bombs. This kind of power is closely tied to truth. If you believe a false physical theory, you won’t be able to build an atom bomb. On the other hand, power also means having the ability to manipulate human beliefs, thereby getting lots of people to cooperate effectively. Building atom bombs requires not just a good understanding of physics, but also the coordinated labor of millions of humans. Planet Earth was conquered by Homo sapiens rather than by chimpanzees or elephants, because we are the only mammals that can cooperate in very large numbers. And large-scale cooperation depends on believing common stories. But these stories need not be true. You can unite millions of people by making them believe in completely fictional stories about God, about race or about economics. The dual nature of power and truth results in the curious fact that we humans know many more truths than any other animal, but we also believe in much more nonsense. We are both the smartest and the most gullible inhabitants of planet Earth. Rabbits don’t know that E=MC² , that the universe is about 13.8 billion years old and that DNA is made of cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine. On the other hand, rabbits don’t believe in the mythological fantasies and ideological absurdities that have mesmerized countless humans for thousands of years. No rabbit would have been willing to crash an airplane into the World Trade Center in the hope of being rewarded with 72 virgin rabbits in the afterlife. When it comes to uniting people around a common story, fiction actually enjoys three inherent advantages over the truth. First, whereas the truth is universal, fictions tend to be local. Consequently if we want to distinguish our tribe from foreigners, a fictional story will serve as a far better identity marker than a true story. Suppose we teach our tribal members to believe that “the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.” That makes for a very poor tribal myth. For if I encounter somebody in the jungle and that person tells me that the sun rises in the east, it might indicate that she is a loyal member of our tribe, but it might just as well indicate that she is an intelligent foreigner who reached the same conclusion independently of our tribe. It is therefore better to teach tribe members that “the sun is the eye of a giant frog that each day leaps across the sky,” since few foreigners — however intelligent — are likely to hit upon this particular idea independently. The second huge advantage of fiction over truth has to do with the handicap principle, which says that reliable signals must be costly to the signaler. Otherwise, they can easily be faked by cheaters. For example, male peacocks signal their fitness to female peahens by sporting an enormous colorful tail. This is a reliable signal of fitness, because the tail is heavy, cumbersome and attracts predators. Only a truly fit peacock can survive despite this handicap. Something similar happens with stories. If political loyalty is signaled by believing a true story, anyone can fake it. But believing ridiculous and outlandish stories exacts greater cost, and is therefore a better signal of loyalty. If you believe your leader only when he or she tells the truth, what does that prove? In contrast, if you believe your leader even when he or she builds castles in the air, that’s loyalty! Shrewd leaders might sometimes deliberately say nonsensical things as a way to distinguish reliable devotees from fair-weather supporters. Third, and most important, the truth is often painful and disturbing. Hence if you stick to unalloyed reality, few people will follow you. An American presidential candidate who tells the American public the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about American history has a 100 percent guarantee of losing the elections. The same goes for candidates in all other countries. How many Israelis, Italians or Indians can stomach the unblemished truth about their nations? An uncompromising adherence to the truth is an admirable spiritual practice, but it is not a winning political strategy. Some might argue that the long-term costs of believing fictional stories outweigh any short-term advantages in social cohesion. Once people get in the habit of believing absurd fictions and convenient falsehoods, this habit would spill into more and more areas, and they would consequently make bad economic decisions, adopt counterproductive military strategies and fail to develop effective technologies. While this occasionally happens, it is far from being a universal rule. Even the most extreme zealots and fanatics can often compartmentalize their irrationality so that they believe nonsense in some fields, while being eminently rational in others. Think, for example, about the Nazis. Nazi racial theory was a bogus pseudoscience. Though they tried to buttress it with scientific evidence, the Nazis nevertheless had to silence their rational faculties in order to develop a belief strong enough to justify murdering millions of people. Yet when it came time to design gas chambers and prepare timetables for the Auschwitz trains, Nazi rationality emerged from its hiding place intact. What’s true of the Nazis is true of many other fanatical groups in history. It is sobering to realize that the Scientific Revolution began in the most fanatical culture in the world. Europe in the days of Columbus, Copernicus and Newton had one of the highest concentrations of religious extremists in history, and the lowest level of tolerance. Newton himself apparently spent more time looking for secret messages in the Bible than deciphering the laws of physics. The luminaries of the Scientific Revolution lived in a society that expelled Jews and Muslims, burned heretics wholesale, saw a witch in every cat-loving elderly lady and started a new religious war every full moon. If you had traveled to Cairo or Istanbul around 400 years ago, you would have found a multicultural and tolerant metropolis where Sunnis, Shiites, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Armenians, Copts, Jews and even the occasional Hindu lived side by side in relative harmony. Though they had their share of disagreements and riots — and though the Ottoman Empire routinely discriminated against people on religious grounds — it was a liberal paradise compared with Western Europe. If you had then sailed on to contemporary Paris or London, you would have found cities awash with religious bigotry, in which only those belonging to the dominant sect could live. In London they killed Catholics; in Paris they killed Protestants; the Jews had long been driven out; and nobody even entertained the thought of letting any Muslims in. And yet the Scientific Revolution began in London and Paris rather than in Cairo or Istanbul. The ability to compartmentalize rationality probably has a lot to do with the structure of our brain. Different parts of the brain are responsible for different modes of thinking. Humans can subconsciously deactivate and reactivate those parts of the brain that are crucial for skeptical thinking. Thus Adolf Eichmann could have shut down his prefrontal cortex while listening to Hitler give an impassioned speech, and then reboot it while poring over the Auschwitz train schedule. Even if we need to pay some price for deactivating our rational faculties, the advantages of increased social cohesion are often so big that fictional stories routinely triumph over the truth in human history. Scholars have known this for thousands of years, which is why scholars often had to decide whether they served the truth or social harmony. Should they aim to unite people by making sure everyone believes in the same fiction, or should they let people know the truth even at the price of disunity? Socrates chose the truth and was executed. The most powerful scholarly establishments in history — whether of Christian priests, Confucian mandarins or Communist ideologues — placed unity above truth. That’s why they were so powerful.

2019,Why Giant Pipes (Intentionally) Spewed Water and Sand Onto Rockaway Beach,"With new hordes flocking to the Rockaways, some important local elements keep leaving — the sands. Who you calling Sisyphus? A pleasant British tourist, who declined to give his name, said that he had heard about Rockaway Beach from a friend’s mum, so there he was, in the extravagant sunshine of last Sunday afternoon, with two friends, one of whom went in the water. Cold, was the report. Since the beaches of Rockaway Beach are constantly drifting away, requiring fresh sands to take their place, it makes sense that new life-forms find their way there, including pleasant British tourists — softish shoulders, neatish beard — steered by their friends’ mums. Human crop rotation, maybe. This one did not know how much toil and federal and city loot went into the sand under his feet. You see all these pipes and heavy machinery here ? Just weeks ago they were working 24/7 to rebuild this stretch of Rockaway Beach between Beach 92nd Street and Beach 105th Street, which last year had become so narrow that the city suddenly closed most of it for the season just days before Memorial Day, a move that made beachside business owners feel insufficiently blessed. That was last year. Tides roll in, tides roll out, and what do you know, this year $13.4 million washed up on the shore, in the currency of sand — 348,000 cubic yards of it, pumped onto the beach from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ dredging mission in East Rockaway Inlet. The strip of beach reopens for swimming this weekend. “We’re beyond stoked,” said Michael Perzy Powers, a co-owner of the Low Tide Bar and High 97 concessions at Beach 97th Street, eyeing a genial midafternoon crowd. Summer frenzy had not yet arrived. But at least this year, Mr. Powers felt confident that it will. “Last year was a struggle,” he said. A commander from the Corps of Engineers said that if you piled that much sand onto a football field the heap would be 20 stories high. That’s in addition to nearly 3 million cubic yards of sand that was already added to a two-mile stretch of the beach in 2014, a project that cost $28 million in federal emergency relief funds available after Hurricane Sandy. Ever since Rockaway Taco opened nearby in 2007, drawing other foodie-friendly vendors to the area, this stretch of the barrier island has been a magnet for off-islanders, including busloads from Williamsburg in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side of Manhattan. (The taco shack closed in 2015, replaced by Tacoway Beach.) Mr. Powers had a thought about that. In the past, he said, the beach stayed open with even more erosion than last year. But that was before the fashionable crowds came. “Now it gets more attention,” he said, and left it at that. No point in spoiling a beautiful day. But in fact, Rockaway Beach has always gotten a lot of attention — almost $270 million in restoration efforts since 1930 (in today’s dollars), as of the latest tabulation by the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. That’s more than any other beach in the country. The federal government has replenished the sand at least 37 times. Andy Coburn, associate director of the program, said that what we call beach erosion might more accurately be called shoreline migration, the island’s natural response to changing currents and “human interactions.” The Rockaways want to move westward, but we won’t let them. Thus the unceasing need for more sand. As a character says in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel “The Leopard,” “For everything to stay the same, everything must change.” Or, as Hector Mosley, a spokesman for the Corps, put it, “In the past, Rockaway was a much shorter place.” He called the island “a sacrificial barrier to large storm waves.” With tacos and a decent surf scene. Valerie Costa, who was relaxing on the boardwalk with her boyfriend and his young daughter, called the new sand a “Band-Aid on a broken leg,” but she said she was glad to see the beach open, however long this fix lasts. A lifelong Rockaway Beach resident, she was still smarting from a 2010 New York Times article about Rockaway Beach that called her father “amusing, almost.” Tides roll in. Condescension now tends to target the outsiders rather than the natives. The arc of the moral universe bends slowly, etc. But no matter. When the beach was closed last year, Ms. Costa said, these same outsiders wandered confused into her neighborhood farther west, around Beach 107th Street. “We felt the ripple effect from everyone coming up,” she said. “If putting in sand opens the beaches and restores balance, I’m happy with that.” The Corps’ next plan, starting in 2020, is to build jetties and groins to slow the erosion. On a sand bank below the boardwalk, Wanda Osorio pulled a towel over herself to protect her from the cool wind. She has lived in the Rockaways for 47 of her 65 years — maybe enough, she said. But where would she find a beach like this? Still, rising sea levels might take some of the fun out of life on a sacrificial barrier, she said. “That’s predicted,” she said. “The water’s gonna take over New York. I think that’s the last days.” Perhaps. In the meantime, surf’s up! But step lively, friends. Hurricane season begins June 1.",The New York Times
2019,Why Giving Up Is Sometimes the Best Way to Solve a Problem,"Why are you trying to solve that problem, anyway? Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter! Every Monday, Tim Herrera emails readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. One of my proudest professional accomplishments is a weird one: I convinced a handful of colleagues to just give up. We were in a brainstorming session trying to solve a problem that had been giving us trouble for some time. We must have run through a half-dozen solutions, each more convoluted than the last, essentially trying to figure out how to fit a square peg into a round hole. The real problem, we finally realized, wasn’t the one we were trying to solve. It was that we were so focused on finding a solution that we never stopped to question whether we should even be doing the thing causing us problems in the first place. The solution we were too tunnel-visioned to see turned out to be the simplest: Just stop doing that thing. Duh. Learning to fail the right way is something we’ve covered often in Smarter Living before. But reaching for the insight to see beyond the problem at hand is a different way of looking at problem solving. Rather than fighting tooth and nail to find the “correct” solution to the problem in front of you, sometimes it’s worth the risk of looking foolish to ask: Why are we even trying to solve this problem, anyway? Stepping outside of one’s thought processes is what researchers call metacognition, or the conscious thinking about thinking. To oversimplify, we could call this a trait of self-awareness. The problem is that humans are pretty bad at being self-aware and thinking about the thought processes behind our decisions. One study from 2014 found that while some 95 percent of people think they’re self-aware, “self-awareness is a truly rare quality: We estimate that only 10 percent to 15 percent of the people we studied actually fit the criteria.” [Like what you’re reading? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.] Compounding the problem is that we sometimes force ourselves to stick with failing endeavors — even if we’re fully aware they’re failing — because we’ve already invested so much time in them. In one study that examined this phenomenon (known as the sunk cost fallacy), researchers argued that “this paradoxical state of affairs is due to humans’ overgeneralization of the ‘Don’t waste’ rule.” In other words: Sometimes our past investments of time, resources or energy make our future decisions almost predetermined, and we’re so bad at metacognition that we may not even realize it. So how can we better solve problems we’re already invested in while our dumb brains, yet again, are working against us? Two things: Consider that just giving up is as valid a solution to a given problem as anything else, and think about problems from a wholly different perspective. “It definitely is kind of an issue of ego or self-esteem because we believe that we want to be a success, and in our eyes, quitting is a type of failure,” Dr. Kristin Neff, an associate professor at the University of Texas, told The Times last year in a story about strategic quitting. And Seth Godin, author of “The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick),” said to think about sunk cost as a gift from a totally different person: your other, previous self. “Once you realize that whatever you’re quitting is a gift from your former self, you don’t have to accept,” he said.

Sometimes You Have to Quit to Get Ahead Winners are just people who know when to quit — and do it often. This week I’ve invited Danielle Campoamor, a senior editor at Romper and a columnist at Bustle, to tell us how to be motivated by watching our friends succeed. It’s a common, arguably unavoidable situation: a friend is advancing in his or her career or personal life while you’re stuck in what feels like an endless loop of 9-to-5 roadblocks and relationship dead ends. While it’s easy — and normal! — to grow jealous, you can harness that green-eyed monster to propel you toward your elusive goal. “If you and your friend are doing very similar things, then your friend’s success could be a motivating factor,” the psychologist Venus Mahmoodi said. The key is to realize you’re jealous, be happy for your friend, and then “sit down and think about the things you like about your life and the things you could change.” A 2006 study published in the Academy of Management Journal found that the juxtaposing feelings of happiness and jealousy can help you better organize your life and fuel your creativity. If your friend is on a different path but inciting envy nonetheless, those feelings of resentment can still work to your advantage. “You need to ask yourself if being similar to your friend is the best route,” Dr. Mahmoodi said. “Or is it possible to find your own way and become successful in what you’re doing.” Your jealousy can help you get over any anxieties you have over making a necessary change, or help you better manage your expectations and set realistic, personalized goals. So the next time a friend’s promotion or engagement sends you down a jealous rabbit hole of self-loathing, use those feelings as a blueprint for your next success.",The New York Times
2019,Why Gulping Down a Cold Drink Feels So Rewarding,"Trilobites In a study of mice, researchers found no links between the neural systems related to reward and monitoring water intake. After a long hike on a hot day, few things are more rewarding than a tall, frosty glass of water. The rush of pleasure that comes with a drink might feel like a sign from your body that you’ve done the right thing, a reward for remedying your dehydration. But that pleasing sensation isn’t actually linked to your real need for a drink. In a study published Wednesday in the journal Neuron, a group of scientists who have studied how thirst works in the bodies of mammals report that the neural systems related to the feeling of reward work independently of those involved in monitoring water intake. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Staying hydrated is high on most organisms’ list of priorities. Mammals have multiple ways of tracking the water they’ve consumed, a subject Yuki Oka, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology, has long studied in mice. The mechanisms in other mammals, including humans, may be similar. One method he and colleagues explored in earlier research involves the gulping motion made by the throat as liquid is swallowed. That gulping sends a message to the brain that water has been consumed, quieting the neurons that generate the urge to drink. But that happens regardless of whether the substance gulped was water or oil, suggesting that the act of gulping only briefly convinces your brain that your thirst is quenched. The body also tracks the presence of water in the gut, and when it becomes clear that water is not arriving, thirst returns. Dr. Oka and colleagues report in their latest study that injecting water directly into the stomachs of mice did quench thirst, albeit after a longer lag. “That gives you a sensation of satiation,” said Dr. Oka. But did satiation come with satisfaction? To test that out, the researchers gave some mice water orally, and put it directly into the stomachs of others. Another batch of mice had their thirst neurons artificially manipulated to generate the sensation of quenching. At the same time, the team watched the activity of certain neurons in the brains of the mice. These neurons’ release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, helps to reward and reinforce the learning of positive behaviors. When mice drank water normally, a flood of dopamine resulted, suggesting the behavior was rewarding. But when the researchers quenched the rodents’ thirst by sending water to their stomachs, or by directly manipulating their thirst neurons, nothing happened. In a way, this parallels the experience of anyone who’s had an IV in a hospital, said Vineet Augustine, a graduate student in Dr. Oka’s lab and a co-author of the paper. “You get water or saline directly infused into your body, so you probably wouldn’t feel thirsty,” he said. All your hydration needs are met. But no pleasure is involved. “Contrast this to drinking water after a hike or something,” he continued. “If you just orally drink water, you would feel very good.” So hydration by itself isn’t rewarding. Still, that blissful feeling that comes with a cold glass of water is very real. “What we think is that maybe dopamine release is coupled with drinking behavior itself,” said Dr. Oka — the behavior, not the results. Maybe it is a learned behavior, he added. Your whole life, you have been drinking water, and that may have been reinforced by the release of dopamine, rather than the hydration itself being rewarding. “Satiation from gulping is a really physical feeling. But we think that probably the pleasure is coming from the realization that you are drinking something,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Harvard Dean and Weinstein Lawyer Don’t Mix,"letter A Harvard student says a lawyer has the right to defend unpopular clients, but not at the same time as being a university dean. To the Editor: Re “Harvard Drops Weinstein Lawyer as a Faculty Dean” (news article, May 12): News outlets have acted as though Harvard undergraduates do not understand basic legal principles. To be clear, Harvard’s undergraduate community understands that even unpopular clients deserve adequate representation. This controversy has never been about that. It has been about the fact that Ronald Sullivan’s position as faculty dean directly conflicted with his position as Harvey Weinstein’s defense lawyer (he withdrew from the defense team on Monday but has said he would be available for consultation). Faculty deans have many jobs, one of which is to act as the point of contact for undergraduate students who want to come forward with reports of sexual abuse, assault or harassment. As a lawyer, Dean Sullivan may defend whomever he chooses. Harvard students were never protesting that fact. However, Dean Sullivan’s attempt to hold two directly conflicting positions was an infringement on students’ safety, as it would have silenced many students who have been sexually abused and decreased their willingness to come forward. We at Harvard College understand that it is a lawyer’s right, and even duty, to protect unpopular clients. However, we also understand that it is our responsibility to hold our college accountable when it allows someone in a position of great power to engage in conflicts of interest at our expense.

2019,"The Global Helium Shortage Is Real, but Don’t Blame Party Balloons","Party City, one of the country’s leading suppliers of colorful balloons, disposable tablecloths and small signs declaring “Oh, Kale Yeah!,” announced recently that it would shutter 45 of its 870 stores in 2019. Across the internet, many said it was because of a shortage of helium. A spokeswoman for Party City said that was a big misunderstanding. Yes, some locations have been struggling to meet helium demand. And yes, the company’s chief executive, James M. Harrison, issued a statement telling shareholders that the company had just signed a deal with a new helium supplier. But Party City closes some locations every year to invest more in its most profitable locations, she emphasized. The fact that it is closing more stores than usual in 2019 has nothing to do with helium, the company says. And yet the question remains: What happened to the helium? It’s supposed to be one of the most prevalent elements in the universe. Calls to Party City stores found that a location in Lee’s Summit, Mo., has been out of helium on and off since October; a store in Overland Park, Kan., has been out of helium for over a week; and a store in San Francisco has been running low for months. What exactly is going on here? Here are some answers: Yes indeed. And it’s much bigger than Party City. This is the third global helium shortage in the past 14 years, said Phil Kornbluth, a consultant who has been working in the helium industry for 36 years. “We started referring to this as helium shortage 3.0,” he said. To work in any business relying on helium requires accepting that sooner or later your supplier will let you down, said Sondra Wilson of Creative Carnivals & Events in Overland Park. She quit working with balloons five years ago. “It was too unreliable,” she said. Of course, giving up helium is not possible for everyone. Because helium gas doesn’t burn, it’s useful for rocket engines. And because liquid helium is so cold, it’s used to cool superconducting magnets used by M.R.I. scanners. Joseph DiVerdi, a chemist at Colorado State University, relies on 60 liters of liquid helium every eight weeks for his work. “My situation is analogous to treading near the edge of a treacherous cliff,” he told Physics Today last month. In 1958, the giant balloons in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade were filled with air instead of helium because of yet another shortage. But while this is not a new problem, helium supplies have grown particularly low lately because existing sources are dwindling and future projects have been delayed, Mr. Kornbluth said. Part of the problem is that as delightful — and essential — as helium may be, it’s an afterthought for many international businesses. Ninety-seven percent of the world’s helium is produced as a “waste product,” collected while processing natural gas or producing liquefied natural gas, Mr. Kornbluth said. Longstanding sources of it in the United States, Qatar and elsewhere are currently running low. New natural gas projects are on the horizon. But these projects are enormous, expensive and affected largely by factors that have little to do with children’s birthday parties or even broader helium needs. Because it’s extraordinarily expensive and difficult to store. It’s the coldest substance on the planet, and a tiny bit of heat turns it to gas. Even when kept in a cryogenic container, the liquid slowly boils off, said Samuel Burton, a field manager at the Bureau of Land Management’s helium storage facility in Amarillo, Tex. Store it as gas and it gradually leaks out of most containers, Mr. Burton said. Yes, Mr. Burton’s employer has. In the Federal Reserve in Amarillo, helium is compressed at the surface and stored in a layer of dolomite rock more than 3,000 feet underground. Above this, a thick layer of salt keeps it in place. “Imagine a huge layer cake with one layer able to absorb helium,” he said. Not everyone can afford such a setup. If by Party City analysts, you mean Phi Phi O’Hara of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” she thinks it’s going to be O.K. (What are her qualifications? A single iconic line, but sometimes that goes far.) There are other places to get balloons and cheap plastic goods, she said in an interview over Instagram messenger. “When there is no Party City to go back to, you create a new home,” she observed. And Party City stores in most of America will not change — aside from being better able to offer helium because of a new contract with a better-positioned helium supplier. If the helium struggles continue, maybe that’s for the best, said Ms. Wilson, the party planner. Balloon releases are horrible for the environment, and parents get overexcited about decorating even though, really, “children just want to play,” she said. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the prevalence of helium. It is one of the most abundant elements in the universe, not on earth.",The New York Times
2019,Why High-Class People Get Away With Incompetence,"In season four of NBC’s “Parks and Recreation,” Paul Rudd plays a wealthy businessman named Bobby Newport who runs for city council because he’s looking for something “easy” to do. He is asked during a debate how he’d fix the town. His answer: “I have no idea.” Still, the audience goes wild, much to the frustration of his rival, Leslie Knope. It’s funny because it’s relatable. Sooner or later, we all may encounter a Bobby Newport. What is it about an elite upbringing that seems to make people feel qualified for tasks where they have little experience? This is one of the questions that inspired a study published Monday in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. The researchers suggest that part of the answer involves what they call “overconfidence.” In several experiments, they found that people who came from a higher social class were more likely to have an inflated sense of their skills — even when tests proved that they were average. This unmerited overconfidence, they found, was interpreted by strangers as competence. The findings highlight yet another way that family wealth and parents’ education — two of a number of factors used to assess social class in the study — affect a person’s experience as they move through the world. “With this research, we now have reason to think that coming from a higher social class confers yet another advantage,” said Jessica A. Kennedy, a professor of management at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study. Studying social class is tricky. First there’s the matter of definitions. “Most people would say they are middle class,” said Peter Belmi, a professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business and a lead author of the study. But how can that be? Even researchers who specialize in social class struggle to agree on the weight to give income, family wealth, professional prestige and other factors. Previous work has found that many people can correctly gauge a stranger’s family income bracket and mother’s education level within 60 seconds. But what exactly they are responding to is not well understood, said Rebecca Carey, who studies social class and identity at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. The study consisted of four experiments. Class was defined multiple ways each time. The first experiment involved about 150,000 small-business owners in Mexico applying for a loan. In addition to providing their income and education level, they were asked to select a rung on a ladder, representing their place relative to others in Mexico. As part of the loan process, they took a memory test. (The real-life task was designed to try to predict whether a person would default on a loan.) For the purposes of the study, participants were also asked to estimate how well they thought they did compared with others. Higher-class people generally performed better than others — but not to the degree they assumed they did, researchers found. The disparity between upper-class people’s estimated performance and actual performance was more dramatic in a later study involving 230 University of Virginia students. This time, social class was measured by students’ assessment of how they saw themselves relative to others in the United States, their parents’ income and their parents’ education. Researchers found that students of higher social classes failed to outperform their peers in a trivia exercise. But once again, most were certain they had. In an attempt to understand the implications of overconfidence, the researchers constructed a mock job interview. The students were asked the same question and videotaped. A group of strangers then watched the videos and rated the candidates. The selection committee generally opted for the same people who’d overestimated their trivia abilities. Overconfidence was misinterpreted as competence. Dr. Carey was unconvinced by how much the faux-job interview experiment demonstrated about real life. She also had some concerns about the findings from the first of the four experiments, which she believed relied too heavily on the participants’ own sense of social class standing. “But what they do very consistently show is that social class is tied to overconfidence,” she said. Other studies have also shown that people who are overconfident are perceived as more competent. Dr. Carey suggested that it could be that “in a lower-class context, the cost is higher if you are wrong when you make a mistake.” And not all class groups value “faking it until you make it,” Dr. Belmi said. “I grew up in the Philippines with the idea that if you have nothing to say, just shut up and listen.” Researchers said they hoped that the takeaway was not to strive to be overconfident. Wars, stock market crashes and many other crises can be blamed on overconfidence, they said. So how do managers, employers, voters and customers avoid overvaluing social class and being duped by incompetent wealthy people? Dr. Kennedy said she had been encouraged to find that if you show people actual facts about a person, the elevated status that comes with overconfidence often fades away. “We may also need to punish overconfident behavior more than we do,” she said.

2019,Opinion | Why I Am Voting for South Africa’s Ramaphosa,"The country’s president needs a strong mandate to execute his reforms and to keep his corrupt colleagues in the African National Congress at bay. Mr. Gevisser is a writer from South Africa. JOHANNESBURG — South Africa goes to the polls on Wednesday in its fifth general election since the advent of democracy in 1994. I will hold my nose and vote for the African National Congress, once the party of Nelson Mandela. I once passionately supported the A.N.C. I abandoned it a decade ago because of its arrogance, its muddle-headed policy and the way it turned my country into a kleptocracy, so soon after it delivered us so stunningly into democracy. In the past three elections I have voted for opposition parties because of the need to break the A.N.C.’s corrupting stranglehold on power. But the situation facing South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has brought me back, at least for now. Mr. Ramaphosa, who heads the A.N.C., needs a strong mandate to execute his reforms and to keep his corrupt comrades at bay. The kleptocrats within the A.N.C. still control the party and thus its list of candidates to Parliament. They will not go quietly into obscurity, or jail, and will be looking for a pretext to fire Mr. Ramaphosa. They may do so anyway after he wins them a victory — he is far more popular than the party. But a weak showing at the polls would only strengthen their hand. Mr. Ramaphosa narrowly won the leadership of the party in December 2017, presenting himself as a clean and technocratic alternative to the systems of patronage that had set in around President Jacob Zuma. A few weeks later, Mr. Ramaphosa led an internal coup against Mr. Zuma, who had been found by the country’s constitutional court to be unfit for office because of misappropriation of state funds to improve his private residence. Mr. Zuma had also all but sold his government to a corrupt cartel led by an Indian business family, the Guptas, in a process that became known in South Africa as “state capture.” Mr. Ramaphosa is a former unionist who was the A.N.C.’s chief negotiator during the talks that led to the end of apartheid in 1994. He was Mr. Mandela’s first choice as successor, but when the party grandees chose Thabo Mbeki instead, he went into business. He leveraged his political connections to become one of South Africa’s richest men; his estimated worth is $550 million. He decided to re-enter politics in 2012, when the party elected him Mr. Zuma’s deputy. He sat quietly by Mr. Zuma’s side as the Deputy President of South Africa as the evidence against his boss accumulated. Many South Africans cannot forgive him for this, but Mr. Ramaphosa plays the long game. He is the first South African leader since Mr. Mandela with broad appeal across this divided country’s races and classes. His famed ability to bring people together is being tested now as he tries to coax international investors with market-friendly incentives while also enacting populist A.N.C. policies, such as changing the Constitution to speed up land reform. The party has resolved to expropriate land from white owners without having to offer them compensation. Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Ramaphosa has an energetic plan to revive South Africa’s stagnant economy — an absolute necessity as unemployment is at 27 percent. In the 15 months he has been in power he has not yet managed to stimulate economic renewal. But he has made significant progress in fighting corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa cannily appointed independent commissions of inquiry and used their findings to fire the leadership at the South African Revenue Service and the National Prosecuting Authority, which were seen as two of the most “captured” critical organs of state. He chose competent technocrats as replacements. Although there is not, yet, much to show for it, their credibility — and Mr. Ramaphosa’s own — rests on their ability to investigate and prosecute Mr. Zuma, his cronies and their enablers. And Mr. Ramaphosa has appointed Raymond Zondo, the deputy chief justice, to head the Commission of Inquiry Into State Capture, Corruption and Fraud. South Africans are transfixed by the proceedings of the commission, which are broadcast live almost every day. The revelations run from tawdry micro-seductions (a Louis Vuitton handbag stuffed with cash) to macro-estimates (the calculation that Mr. Zuma’s 2015 attempt to appoint a lackey as finance minister cost the economy $34 billion). A former deputy finance minister, Mcebesi Jonas, recounted how the Gupta brothers tried to bribe him, but he cautioned the commission not to “over Zuma-nise” its investigations. To do so would be to miss the point, which is that the systems of patronage and corruption exemplified by Mr. Zuma are deeply embedded in government and in the A.N.C. The rot starts at the municipal level, where it seems to have become the norm to obtain state tenders through bribery. In “How to Steal a City,” Crispian Olver, an A.N.C. insider, describes the way competing political factions in the city of Port Elizabeth were criminal cartels vying for government gravy. One of these factions comprises Mr. Ramaphosa’s strongest supporters in the Eastern Cape Province. And the A.N.C.’s own integrity commission has reportedly found fault with 22 of the candidates on the party’s electoral list. This is why I am holding my nose. Others are simply turning away from a contest that offers no attractive alternative to the A.N.C. and Mr. Ramaphosa. His opponent to the right is Mmusi Maimane, a smooth but shallow preacher whose party, the Democratic Alliance, cannot break out of an ethnic ghetto: Its supporters are members of the white, Indian and colored minorities. His opponent to the left is Julius Malema, a gifted populist, who calls for land invasions and the nationalization of the economy. The growing constituency of Mr. Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighters party consists of the marginalized urban poor. Most of those who vote will, still, cast their ballots for the A.N.C. Some will do so because, like me, they wish to give Mr. Ramaphosa a chance. Others will do so for reasons more atavistic (this is the liberation party) or pragmatic (this is the party that runs the show). Polls suggest, however, that the A.N.C. majority will drop down a few points from the 62.2 percent it garnered in 2014. The beneficiary will be Mr. Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighters party. But fewer South Africans will be voting. In 1994, 86 percent of the eligible voters cast their vote. On Wednesday, it will probably be less than 50 percent. Ten million people have not even bothered to register to vote. Most are under 30. More than one in three of these are unemployed. Too many South Africans are becoming alienated politically and disenfranchised economically. I am voting for the A.N.C. in the hope that Cyril Ramaphosa — and the team he will hopefully assemble around him, once he has a popular mandate — can begin to change this devastating course.

2019,Opinion | Why India Needs Modi,"The country’s leader has fulfilled his economic promises. Mr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. Exit polls are predicting a significant win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India when final results are announced on Thursday. That’s not only good news for Mr. Modi; it’s also good news for his country. While his bold economic policies generated a blizzard of controversy, I came away from a recent trip to India more optimistic about the prospects for India and its 1.3 billion people. For that, much credit goes to Mr. Modi. Elected in 2014 on a platform of aggressive change, he has delivered on important reforms to modernize India’s hidebound economy. Perhaps the most important challenge that Mr. Modi had to address was lagging productivity. In part, that’s due to the country’s slowness to urbanize. Mumbai may be wildly overcrowded, but India’s overall urbanization rate is only 34 percent, compared with China’s 59 percent. And it’s also a consequence of poor infrastructure and the estimated 81 percent of Indians who work in the “informal” economy. At first glance, some of Mr. Modi’s reforms may seem small. He replaced a portion of a complex tax system with a kind of national sales tax. The change is forcing businesses operating in the informal sector to regularize and — this is important — begin to pay taxes. (India’s taxes as a share of the size of the economy are among the lowest in the world.) He instituted a new bankruptcy code. That may also appear minor, but providing a mechanism for reorganizing insolvent companies speedily is central to increasing private investment, a critical need for India. The list goes on. To be sure, India’s growth rate, after picking up earlier in Mr. Modi’s tenure, has slowed a bit. But even the International Monetary Fund is optimistic about the prospect of a reacceleration. Other measures also show promise. In the World Bank’s latest Ease of Doing Business Report, India rose to 77, up from 100 a year earlier, a jump that the bank’s president called “historic and unprecedented.” The new approach has come with noneconomic improvements, everything from clean government (at least in proximity to Mr. Modi) to clean(er) cities. Of course, Mr. Modi’s tenure has not been an unvarnished success. Even a sparkling growth rate isn’t enough to lift the standard of living in India close to that of China. Of late, a mini-financial crisis has put a damper on credit growth. For many, the reforms (and in sectors like agriculture, the lack of them) have been tough. Agricultural employment and wages have fallen. The tax reforms and failure to modernize labor markets have brought increased joblessness. And “demonetization” — elimination of old currency, a signature Modi initiative — has brought more dislocation than fiscal progress. When India’s rupee fell last year, the country’s reliance on imported oil meant soaring energy costs. To some degree, Mr. Modi is suffering from a common problem of transformational leaders: unfulfilled lofty expectations. India will not become China, with its vast investment in infrastructure, its world-class technology companies and its inescapable drive to succeed. As recently as 1990, the economies of China and India were roughly the same size. Today, India’s gross domestic product per person ($2,000) is a fraction of China’s ($8,800). Any hope of eclipsing China has vanished. Indeed, a government-sponsored think tank recently acknowledged that India would remain smaller than China even as far out as 2047. But at least for now, India’s rate of expansion is higher than China’s and for that, Mr. Modi deserves much credit. If India is to maintain that superior performance, it should stay the course with him. For his part, Mr. Modi should recognize the importance of a less statist approach and pursue with more vigor important initiatives like deregulation and privatization of state-owned companies. A bit more Thatcherism would serve India well. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

2019,Opinion | Why India Voted for Modi,"letter A young voter from New Delhi tells how the prime minister’s track record was crucial in his victory in the recent election. To the Editor: Re “Envy and Hate Seduced India,” by Pankaj Mishra (Sunday Review, May 26): Rather than being “seduced” by Narendra Modi’s rhetoric, voters, including young ones like me, were persuaded by his vision for India and by his excellent track record as prime minister. In 2014, Mr. Modi inherited a legacy of damage inflicted by previous governments on India’s economy and institutions. He has tackled intractable problems. His policies have included construction of toilets to combat open defecation; loans for small and micro-businesses; a national health care plan; gas connections at subsidized rates and more. India’s electorate has voted for progress and development; to suggest otherwise is plainly wrong. Advaya Hari SinghNew Delhi",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Is Socialism Coming Back in Germany?,"East Germany showed that planned economies fail. Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer. HAMBURG, Germany — Back in the 1980s, a cousin on my father’s side gave me a memorable lesson in socialism. Cousin Werner was an engineer in an East German vehicle factory. Like many others under Communist rule, regardless of their education and skills, he and his wife lived in one of the typically small apartments of a concrete-slab housing complex. These so-called Plattenbauten were praised as a symbol of the East’s allegedly egalitarian society under Erich Honecker. During one of my family’s visits from our home in West Germany, Werner took us to the basement of his building and unlocked the door to a little storage room. In it was a collection of fine tools that amazed even us westerners: hammers and wrenches of all sorts, drilling machines and a turning lathe made for a professional workshop. When we asked him how he had gotten hold of all of this equipment in an economy that was notorious for shortages, Werner shrugged. “Well, Honecker told us to get out of our factories what we can, didn’t he?” he said. Socialism, the idea that workers’ needs are best met by the collectivization of the means of production, didn’t function for Werner. A system in which factories, banks and even housing were nationalized required a planned economy, as a substitute for capitalist competition. Central planning, however, proved unable to meet people’s individual demands, and so rule-breaking and black markets flourished. Werner’s petty theft paled in comparison to the corruption that undermined East Germany from its founding. Eventually, the entire system collapsed; as it did everywhere else, socialism in Germany failed. Which is why it is strange, in 2019, to see socialism coming back into German mainstream politics: Kevin Kühnert, the leader of the Social Democrats’ youth organization and one of his party’s most promising young talents, has made it his calling card. Forget the wannabe socialism of American Democrats like Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The 29-year-old Mr. Kühnert is aiming for the real thing. Socialism, he says, means democratic control over the economy. He wants to replace capitalism as such, not just to recalibrate it. In the United States, policies frequently branded as “socialist” — health care for all, a national minimum wage, and tuition-free universities — have very little to do with actual socialism. Big government, yes — but all of them fit comfortably in a traditional free-market economy. In contrast, German neo-socialism is profoundly different from capitalism. In an interview with my newspaper, Mr. Kühnert took specific aim at the American dream as a model for individual achievement. He said he questioned a system “in which millions start a race, very few make it over the finishing line and then shout back to the others, ‘You could have made it, too!’” Mr. Kühnert’s socialism puts needs before skills and collective well-being before individual reward. Companies like BMW would be collectivized, meaning ownership by the workers. “Without collectivization of one form or another it is unthinkable to overcome capitalism,” he told us. The same principle would be applied to real estate. “I don’t think it is a legitimate business model, to earn a living from the living space of other people,” he said. “Everybody should at most own the living space he himself inhabits.” Everything else would be owned collectively. Why is the idea of socialism, whether the pseudo-socialism of the United States or Mr. Kühnert’s genuine form, flourishing? Above all, it is the seduction of countering one overreaction with its opposite. The first overreaction was the so-called neoliberal era that was ushered in after 1989. The victory over “real existing socialism,” as they called it in East Germany and elsewhere, plus globalization and digitalization, gave the free-market economy an ego boost. But that boost was distorting: Financial gains were increasingly shoveled upward, while the growing list of social risks were shoveled downward. The Sept. 11 attacks were another distortion: Focused on the threat of terrorism, Western nations failed to see a bigger risk. As Kishore Mahbubani argues in his book “Has the West Lost It?” the most decisive event of 2001 was not the attacks, but China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. By essentially giving its imprimatur to Beijing’s unfair trade practices, the West destroyed the economic security that had undergirded its capitalist social contract. Unrestrained capitalism was clearly not what the founders of the West German republic had in mind. “The capitalist economic system did not serve the interests of the German people,” the center-right Christian Democrats declared in 1947. That’s why West Germany was built on the idea of the social market economy — in German, the soziale Marktwirtschaft — in which individual competition was prized, but so was the obligation of the wealthy to help the worse off. Today, though, the wealthiest are often those with the resources and skill to avoid taxes and ship jobs to China. Often they aren’t even German; Warren Buffett is a major investor in Berlin real estate. Seventy years ago, no one imagined such scenarios, and neither of Germany’s major parties has figured out how to adjust the social market economy to those new international realities. As a result, some Germans, like Mr. Kühnert, react not with calls to fix these mistakes, but by condemning capitalism outright. What they fail to see is that socialism will not bring the change they seek. On the contrary, offering failed recipes from the past will only make it easier for the profiteers of unfettered capitalism to denounce them. Cousin Werner would have understood this all too well.

2019,Why Is This Ostrich Wearing an Extra Set of Wings?,"Trilobites Scientists took a creative approach to studying how dinosaurs evolved the flying abilities of modern birds. A young ostrich sprints down a path at a Chinese farm. His neck bobs, his legs pump — and the artificial wings attached to his back flap up and down. Alas, this ostrich will not fly. He’s filling in for another earthbound creature, a dinosaur called Caudipteryx. Some 125 million years ago, this theropod walked on two legs and bore a pair of feathery “proto-wings,” similar to the fake ones worn by the ostrich. Recently, researchers set out to study the long-extinct creature as they took on one of the greatest controversies in paleontology: how avian flight first evolved. In a study published Thursday in PLOS Computational Biology, a team including mechanical engineer Jing-Shan Zhao and several paleontologists used the outfitted ostrich — along with mathematical and robot models — to argue that when Caudipteryx ran, its mini-wings flapped involuntarily. Eventually, the researchers proposed, the dinosaur’s descendants would have harnessed this trait and taken off from the ground for the first time. Other experts are less than convinced, arguing that the study’s analogues don’t do justice to the complexity of the animal it purports to study. But the disagreement itself highlights the unsettled nature of debates over the evolution of flight among the world’s feathered inhabitants. “You’d be hard-pressed to find a paleontologist who doesn’t have an opinion,” said Armita Manafzadeh, a doctoral student at Brown University who was not involved in the study. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Because modern birds evolved from a particular lineage of dinosaurs, the theropods, researchers look to them to figure out how flight began. Some promote a “top-down” theory, contending that winged dinosaurs learned to fly by climbing trees and gliding from the branches, not unlike flying squirrels. Others are on the “ground-up” side, positing that dinosaurs went airborne by running and flapping. Still others question the dichotomy itself, arguing that the two theories are not mutually exclusive. For their entrance into the fray, Dr. Zhao’s group performed three experiments. All focused on Caudipteryx, a useful organism for studying “the evolution from the earliest dinosaur to the modern bird,” said Dr. Zhao, who teaches at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Caudipteryx was discovered in China in the late 1990s, and, in renderings, often resembles an angry, oversized chicken. For the first experiment, the group used fossil analyses to develop a simplified mathematical model of the dinosaur. They then simulated a running motion in the model’s legs, and calculated how other parts of the body responded. They found that at a fast enough clip — between 5.5 and 12.9 miles per hour, a range within Caudipteryx’s estimated capability — the model’s wings flapped. For the second test, they built a robo-Caudipteryx and ran it on a treadmill. Here, too, they observed consistent oscillation, even as they increased and decreased wing length. Then it was time for a live test. Dr. Zhao and his colleagues built a harness with force sensors and a set of wings. They augmented many different birds, including ducks and geese, before settling on the six-month-old ostrich seen in the video. “Its size and weight looked like the real size and weight of Caudipteryx,” said Dr. Zhao. (Because living dinosaurs aren’t available for paleontology studies, their descendants, from baby partridges to chickens with prosthetic tails, often serve as proxies.) As the ostrich ran, flapping was evident, and the sensors measured a small amount of lift: the motion was counteracting some of the bird’s body weight. Dr. Zhao suggests that Caudipteryx might have noticed that the weird thing its wings were doing was actually making it easier to run, and leaned into it. In this way, the passive jostling provided “basic training for later flapping flight,” he said. Is it conclusive proof that flapping came first? Other researchers, though impressed by the study’s three-pronged approach, expressed doubts. Dennis Voeten, who studies flying dinosaurs at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, in France, and Sweden’s Uppsala University, thinks the group’s conclusions went too far. Observing oscillation “does not prove that this dynamic ‘trained’ early feathered dinosaurs in executing a birdlike flapping motion,” he said. Ms. Manafzadeh added that simplifying dinosaur anatomy has its pitfalls, as does using passive, plastic wings to stand in for active limbs. Dr. Zhao responded that the benefits of flapping should have been enough to nudge evolution in that direction, and that the group’s experiments left room for various anatomical considerations. “You can change the mass, or the stiffness of the muscles, anything,” he said. “The flapping motion will not change.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why I’m Now for Impeachment,"letter A reader lays out a possible scenario that changed his view. To the Editor: Re “Impeachment Is a Form of Hope,” by Brenda Wineapple (Op-Ed, May 18): Ms. Wineapple has flipped my position on impeachment. Previously, I (along with Nancy Pelosi) focused on the probability that the Republican Senate would not remove President Trump from office. But now I realize that if the House impeaches him, the Senate must still conduct a trial, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. presiding. Let the senators hear all the evidence presented before a watchful country, and then let them all show the American public where they stand.

2019,Why Markets Aren’t Sweating the U.S.-China Trade War Much: The ‘Trump Put’,"The president has tended to back off whenever markets and the economy have looked soft. The real question is not why the stock market is down this week. It is why it is down so little. After all, the world’s two largest economies have seemed to be hurtling toward a major escalation of their trade war. American officials have complained that Chinese negotiators have been playing a bait-and-switch, backing away from concessions they had agreed to. President Trump said the United States would raise its tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent on Friday, and begin taxing the remaining $325 billion of goods at that rate “shortly.” For a while, it was unclear whether negotiations would resume at all this week. [President Trump taunted China by tweet on Wednesday.] If trade talks did disintegrate, even with the arrival of high-level Chinese officials in Washington, the economy would be in danger of experiencing a meaningful downturn and potentially a recession. Economists at Moody’s Analytics, for example, expect it would subtract 1.8 percentage points from G.D.P. growth and cause unemployment to rise. It would particularly hammer the financial results of some of the prominent American companies that either import Chinese goods or rely on the country as a major export market. Yet the S&P 500 was down only 2.2 percent in the first three trading days of the week. The index has given up only about a month’s worth of gains; markets were lower as recently as early April. The answer to the puzzle lies in a few words: the Trump Put. A “put” is a type of option security that lets people put a floor under their losses. If you buy stock for $50 a share and also a put with a $40 strike price, you are protected from losing more than $10 per share. In his 28 months in office, Mr. Trump has created a sense in markets that he will play that role for the economy as a whole. His administration has followed through on some of his threats — applying tariffs on many steel and aluminum imports, the existing tariffs on Chinese imports that Mr. Trump threatened to expand on Sunday — but has backed off whenever markets and the economy have looked soft. A prime example came late last year, with financial markets falling and the risk of recession rising. The emergence of constructive negotiations between American and Chinese officials — in particular after a Feb. 22 Oval Office meeting — was one factor in a rally that has driven stocks up 15 percent so far in 2019. The Federal Reserve’s decision to back off plans for interest rate increases, as well as successful Chinese efforts to stimulate its economy, were other major factors. If you’re trying to bet on where markets will be six months or a year from now, there are a few things you know. The president of the United States cares a lot about what happens to the stock market, as his tweets make plain. He will be running for re-election in 18 months. He enjoys making big, bold promises, many of which don’t materialize. That adds up to a conviction that nothing really bad will happen — that the administration will strike some kind of deal, even if it does little to address long-term economic tensions between the United States and China. The only problem is that the existence of the Trump Put creates a funny circular system. President Trump is more confident in taking an aggressive negotiating stand because the stock market is up a lot this year and the American economy is looking solid. The perception of a Trump Put means that markets don’t fall very much even with that tougher negotiating stand. But that, in turn, means a weaker signal to the president and his inner circle that there would be negative consequences if they followed through with the president’s Twitter threats to place tariffs on all Chinese imports. With China’s vice premier, Liu He, set to come to Washington for two days of talks, there is plenty of incentive for both sides to reach a deal. But the existence of the Trump Put seems to increase the odds of a miscalculation. The danger would be greater if the relatively muted market response to the threats of escalation caused Trump administration negotiators to believe his line that the United States economy was doing well because of tariffs (as Mr. Trump has tweeted) and not despite them (as almost all mainstream economists believe). If that miscalculation happens and the Trump Put turns out to be less reliable than it appeared, we will most likely find ourselves in a more damaging sort of global trade war than anything we’ve seen up to this point. And that, in turn, could make the turbulence in markets this week seem downright quaint.",The New York Times
2019,Why Not Let Children Choose Their Own Names?,"They’re going to anyway online, you know. When she was pregnant, Satya Twena, a 36-year-old hat maker and fashion designer in Ojai, Calif., was in a yoga class when her daughter’s name came to her in a meditation. The name was Wish. “Wish named herself because she was already active and alive in my wife,” said Jeffrey Zurofsky, 45, who founded ’Wichcraft with Tom Colicchio before moving to California to work as an adviser and consultant. To the dismay of Ms. Twena and Mr. Zurofsky, their second child didn’t appear to choose his own name … initially. So he was without a name after being born at home in January. It didn’t take long, though, for the infant to offer his own signs, Mr. Zurofsky said. The little one opened his eyes when his father placed sage under his nose; the family remembered that the song playing during the birth was all about wisdom and elders; and a post-birth visitor had a 28-year-old son named Sage. So Sage it was. “If I could, I would let them go their entire lives and they could name themselves, but I feel strongly that their names came from them, so I think we did pretty good,” Mr. Zurofsky said about Wish and Sage. “But if Wish changes her mind and wants to be called Jill or Jim, absolutely. If she wants to be called 8,600, that’s fine, too. They are smarter and wiser than we are on their own behalfs.” Many parents have begun to follow their children’s lead when it comes to gender and identity. Now some are allowing their children to choose their own name, or to change their name as soon as they have a real preference. [The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Visit NYT Parenting for everything you need to raise thriving babies and kids.] While some children enjoy having the freedom to choose their own name, it may not be the best way to offer them this independence, said Carole Lieberman, a child psychiatrist in Beverly Hills, Calif. “These parents are rebelling against tradition just for the thrill of it without realizing how much they are harming their kids,” said Dr. Lieberman, who is a parenting expert and the author of “Lions, Tigers and Terrorists, Oh My!” “Children who have a place holder name or no name would feel like they have no identity and would surely suffer psychological problems.” A better option: They could legally change their name when they’re older and more mature, Dr. Lieberman said. J. Martin Griffith, 36, who works for a clean energy company in Philadelphia, had the option to choose his own name from birth and beyond, but he still can’t make that big decision. Mr. Griffith’s mother named him J, which doesn’t officially stand for anything. “My mother always told me growing up that I could choose a new name,” he said. “I batted around 1,000 names but could never settle on any one name.” He tried lots of J names and also considered non-J names, but nothing stuck. When he was growing up, some people called him Martin, while a few called him J or “J-the-letter.” Today, the vast majority call him Marty or Martin, as he still hasn’t settled. Mr. Griffith isn’t the biggest fan of letting children choose their names. “It is hard enough naming someone else, let alone naming yourself, and a name has surprising weight out in the world, I think,” he said. Still, living with a name that you hate until adulthood is tough, said Embe Guadagno, 29, of Downey, Calif., whose original name was Zierah. “I had expressed to my mother my entire life that I hated that no one was able to pronounce it,” Ms. Guadagno said. She gave herself the name Embe in high school, and legally changed it when she was 19 or 20. Today, she has let her 3-year-old daughter, Laila, know that if there’s a name she likes better than her own, she can change it immediately. So far, she has considered her middle name, Jude, along with Daisy. George Vuckovic, 43, a preschool administrator in River Forest, Ill., also doesn’t see the harm in letting children choose their names. He and his partner, Esther Hunt, a massage therapist, 34, nearly named their daughter Athena but switched to Isabelle in the hospital. A month later, they changed their minds again and renamed her Elena. Now Elena, who is 8, has tinkered with changing her name back to Athena or to Iris. “It’s her life, and if she finds meaning in a different name, why not?” Mr. Vuckovic said. “Other than the potential hassles of multiple identity profiles and red flags that could raise.” Tiffany Towers, a clinical psychologist with a private practice in Beverly Hills, said she understands why parents may be agreeable to allowing their children to choose or change their names so readily. It can be either an attempt to empower their children or to avoid the pressure of assigning a name to their offspring, Dr. Towers said. Perhaps the parents don’t want to feel responsible for their child being bullied for having a weird or old-fashioned name. Or maybe they believe that their child’s future will be shaped by this initial identity of a name (a name that the child didn’t request), and they fear that their child will resent them or feel oppressed by their name. But, she said, giving children permission to change or choose a name could be very confusing for the child. “It would cause them to question not only their own identity, but whether they can trust their parents to make other decisions that affect them,” Dr. Towers said. This process is not always so consequential, however. John Duffy, a psychologist and the author of “The Available Parent,” who lives in Chicago, said he noticed a rise in children with “place holder” names. He has worked with children who have been allowed and encouraged to change their names to ones that they feel represent them better. “I think it is an artifact of parents, very consciously, allowing their kids as much control over their identity as possible,” Dr. Duffy said in an email. “Parents have told me that they feel presumptuous naming their child, not knowing for certain what he or she may want; I think it’s a counterreaction to accusations of overparenting or helicopter parenting.” From the children’s perspectives, Dr. Duffy said he has noticed that they feel empowered through choosing or changing their name. Even choosing a middle name is a start. Daniel Block, 51, a geography professor in Oak Park, Ill., said his parents believed that children should be allowed to choose their middle names. He tried several before settling on his current one. First, there was Ernie, when he was in his “Sesame Street” stage. Then, when he was 7, he wanted to be Daniel Kennedy because he thought John F. Kennedy was cool. But Kennedy was a little formal, so he soon switched to Kenneth. From ages 11 to 17, Mr. Block went without a middle name. “Finally, I decided I wanted a middle name to graduate high school with,” Mr. Block said. He was interested in genealogy and history, so he looked at his family tree for inspiration. “I finally chose Ralston,” Mr. Block said of his middle name, which is also his uncle’s middle name. “I think it’s a pretty conservative name choice for someone who was able to choose their own name, but I think it goes back to liking my uncle and being close to that side of the family and connecting with history.” Though he said he feels pretty good about his choice today, Mr. Block said he wishes he was the kind of person who would have chosen something a little more unusual. “But that is not me,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Why Overtime and a Trump Comparison Are Fueling Threats of a Subway Strike,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo accused workers of overtime fraud. The transit union’s leader then likened Mr. Cuomo to President Trump. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The claim was stunning: A single worker on the Long Island Rail Road earned $344,000 in overtime last year. Yes, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority confirmed, the worker managed to log 3,864 hours of overtime, part of a trend in which dozens of transit workers received millions of dollars for working extra hours. High overtime costs have been a longstanding problem at the authority, but the latest figures have sparked an angry standoff between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the transit workers union. Mr. Cuomo accused workers of fraud and called for an investigation. The transit union’s leader, John Samuelsen, likened the governor to President Trump and argued that overtime was necessary to fix the failing system. Mr. Samuelsen even said the growing tension could lead to a subway strike — something New York City has not seen since 2005. A strike is unlikely, but the fact that it was raised shows how acrimonious things have grown between Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the authority, and the Transport Workers Union, an ally of Mr. Cuomo’s as he ran for a third term last year. Here’s what we know about the overtime debate: Yes. His name is Thomas Caputo, and he was the chief measurement operator at the Long Island Rail Road — a job that involves operating a track geometry car that inspects the rails to identify areas that need repairs. The overtime bonanza brought his total pay last year to $461,646, according to a recent report by the Empire Center, a research nonprofit. That is more than the salary of Andy Byford, the subway leader who makes $325,600 a year — or what Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio earn. Mr. Samuelsen defended Mr. Caputo’s pay, saying that he was assigned by management to do the extra work and that he was the only employee with “that particular skill set.” Mr. Caputo, who retired last month, had worked at the authority for 30 years and had seniority to select overtime assignments for other jobs he was qualified for, transit officials said. Another worker, Michael Gundersen, a maintenance supervisor for the subway and bus system, earned more than $271,000 in overtime last year, bringing his total pay to $379,453. The authority’s chairman, Patrick Foye, said five employees at the Long Island Rail Road were being disciplined for overtime abuse. Mr. Foye has also called for an independent investigation of the problem. At an emergency M.T.A. board meeting on Friday, transit officials said much of the overtime costs were for workers making urgent repairs. In 2017, Mr. Cuomo declared the subway to be in a state of emergency and created a “subway action plan” to fix the system. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad have also been plagued by delays. Mr. Samuelsen said the agency needs more workers to implement the subway action plan. “If you don’t want to pay overtime, hire enough staff,” Mr. Samuelsen said. Mr. Cuomo says some transit workers have abused the overtime and attendance system. “This is about stealing, this is about fraud, this is about people saying they worked and charging the taxpayers when they didn’t work, right?” Mr. Cuomo told reporters on Sunday. “That’s stealing. It’s criminal.” The accusations from Mr. Cuomo — and his ally, Lawrence S. Schwartz, on the authority’s board — have angered the transit union, which is negotiating a new labor contract with the authority. The union’s current contract expires on Wednesday, though the terms will continue until a new agreement is reached. Mr. Samuelsen said comments by Mr. Schwartz and the authority’s decision to send police officers to monitor transit workers had heightened the conflict. “This is the type of behavior you’ve engaged in that triggers strikes on the New York City subway system,” Mr. Samuelsen said at the board meeting. “I’m not saying that as a threat. That’s the truth.” On Monday, Mr. Samuelsen compared Mr. Cuomo to Mr. Trump, saying the governor was circulating lies about workers. “There’s no evidence at all of widespread criminality. It’s a big lie,” Mr. Samuelsen said in an interview. “This is what Donald Trump does.” Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said there were two separate issues: the lack of an effective time and attendance system for subway and bus workers, and “alarming reports of potential overtime fraud” at the Long Island Rail Road. A strike would be, to put it simply, unpleasant. A three-day strike on the subway and bus system in 2005 paralyzed the city. But in recent years, the authority has taken a friendlier tone with the union, and its workers have received significant raises. The Transport Workers Union, which represents more than 38,000 subway and bus workers, has also donated more than $275,000 to Mr. Cuomo’s political campaigns through various branches of the organization. Still, Mr. Cuomo said he would not stand for overtime abuse, especially after the authority raised subway and bus fares and Mr. Cuomo approved new revenue streams for the agency. Mr. Cuomo recently persuaded state lawmakers to pass congestion pricing, a plan to toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise money for the subway. “They’re paying higher fares and they’re going to pay higher tolls,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Now do your job, M.T.A. Perform and perform at a higher rate than you’re now performing.”",The New York Times
2019,"Why Play a Music CD? ‘No Ads, No Privacy Terrors, No Algorithms’","Tech We’re Using Streaming services have revolutionized the discovery of songs, but here’s why Ben Sisario, who covers the music industry, still likes to listen to compact discs. How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ben Sisario, a reporter who covers the music industry, discussed the tech he’s using. What are your most important tech tools for doing your reporting? Probably 75 percent of my reporting is done by phone and email, and when I am writing I print out drafts and notes. So that part of it is about as current as 1995. But I also use Signal and ProtonMail for sources who require secure communication. I constantly scan social media — Twitter, mostly — for news, and in breaking news situations I sometimes find sources to quote there. But I am wary of letting social media itself tell the story. You need to actually talk to people, check facts, find contrary viewpoints, weed out nonsense. When it comes to organizing my work, I think cloud computing is the greatest thing since the manila folder. I have 15-plus years of notes instantly searchable through Dropbox and Google Docs. It’s amazing to type in five characters and find that phone number from an obit you wrote a decade ago. And then there are sites like WhoSampled and Discogs, incredible repositories of information that are deeply addictive for music nerds like me. My time there often starts with legitimate research — say, checking the original writing credit on an old single — but then an hour later I’ve spent $50 on vinyl and reminded myself of the slide whistle sample on “Groove Is in the Heart.” What does your music setup look like, and how has it evolved over time? I try to keep an eye on all the major platforms out there, which means regularly poking around on about a dozen apps. My go-to sources are Spotify, SoundCloud, Bandcamp and Mixcloud, which has excellent D.J.-style mixes and to me feels more human than most. At home I have a Sonos Play:5 speaker, which plays streaming music and podcasts, and is a piece of cake to use. I also have Google Chromecast Audio, a little plug-in device (now discontinued) that allows me to send high-fidelity streams to my stereo. It sounds better that way, but it’s not nearly as easy to use as the Sonos. To be honest, my preferred way to listen to music is on CD, as unfashionable as that might be. You push a button, the music plays, and then it’s over — no ads, no privacy terrors, no algorithms! What are the pros and cons of the streaming model for musicians big and small? The big positive is the vast potential exposure. Streaming eliminated the cost barrier to sampling new music, and playlists constantly put new songs in front of people. Theoretically, at least, there are more chances than ever for a song to be a hit. But, as they say, you can die of exposure. Megahits still generate millions of dollars in royalties, and Spotify’s official mission statement is “giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art.” Yet for artists beneath the megahit level — and that is the vast majority of them — the jury is still out. I’ve seen royalty statements for well-known indie acts that suggest they can earn a decent middle-class living from their streams. I’ve also talked to very successful songwriters who say their income has been decimated by streaming and by the new model for pop songwriting, in which five or six — or 30 — people divvy up the same sliver of royalties. In general, though, I’m optimistic about streaming and its potential. It has reinvigorated the music industry and made listening a lot easier, more fun and more dynamic. Apple and Spotify have been fighting publicly over antitrust issues. Where is this fight going, and what impact might it have on streaming music? I tend to think of this as mostly a matter of corporate warfare. These companies are in a race for market dominance around the world, and the gloves are off. For Spotify, anything that hinders Apple, even a little, can provide an advantage. On the other hand, Apple’s gigantic size means it will always be on the defensive against regulation. I don’t see these issues having a big effect on streaming music. Competition in this market has benefited consumers, and as much as Spotify accuses Apple of anticompetitive practices, it has still signed up far more users — both free and paid — than Apple Music. What emerging tech trends might change the way people listen to music? A great deal of attention is being paid to smart speakers like Amazon’s Alexa. This is something that genuinely feels futuristic: walking into a room and saying, “Play relaxation playlist” or “Play NPR news,” and it just happens. I think we’re still in the early stages of this. Video sharing apps like TikTok are also having a palpable effect on music, and I think that will only grow. TikTok makes it easy to generate video memes using music, and these are fast moving and viral by nature. The best example is Lil Nas X’s song “Old Town Road,” which was a TikTok sensation well before it hit the pop charts. Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? Not to be too much of a grouch, but for me it is more about an opposite kind of phenomenon: What formerly hyped, supposedly essential technology has since been exposed for gross privacy violations, or for how easily it has become a tool for predatory disinformation? Way too many of them, of course, but the really dispiriting thing is realizing that it is nearly impossible to disengage. We have become only more conscious of the risks and dangers surrounding us at all times. That said, in my house we are really happy with our Instant Pot Duo, a beeping digital pressure cooker that makes perfect biriyani or chicken soup in like five minutes. I really hope it is not collecting any private data.",The New York Times
2019,Why Politics Should Be Kept Out of Miscarriages,"The New Health Care The possible problems of a new Georgia law, including causing further pain. Georgia’s much-discussed new law on abortion is one of the most restrictive in the nation. Abortion will be banned as early as six weeks into pregnancy — before many women even know they are pregnant. This law goes even further, though: Although the intent of the law is to block abortion, it has opened a vigorous debate about whether women who miscarry could be questioned or even prosecuted. The new law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, gives a 6-week-old fetus the legal status of a human being. One definition of second-degree murder in Georgia includes cruelty to children during which “he or she causes the death of another human being irrespective of malice.” This raises the question of whether a woman who miscarries because of what is perceived to be her conduct could be held liable for that conduct. “This suggests that women who ‘cause the death’ of a fetus, with or without malice, could be charged with second-degree murder,” said Eric Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University, and a supporter of abortion rights. He said the law would most likely be struck down in the lower courts. Even if the Supreme Court reverses course on abortion, law enforcement authorities with scarce resources may not investigate women this way. “One would hope,” he said, “that there would be a political cost if they did.” But, he noted, given the ambiguities in the new law and its complex interactions with other Georgia statutes, prosecutors would have a lot of discretion, and it would be “completely up to” them. Other Georgia criminal statutes may still protect women from prosecution for ending their pregnancies or for miscarrying. Even if that winds up being true, the new law says doctors who perform abortions will be prosecuted, and that could still have an impact on women who miscarry. Staci Fox, president of Planned Parenthood Southeast, told The Washington Post she didn’t think that the Georgia law could be used to successfully prosecute women, but that a woman who miscarried “could be pulled into an investigation looking at whether someone performed an illegal abortion on her.” It would be helpful, of course, if legislators and judges and prosecutors understood the basics of miscarriage. Early pregnancy loss is not uncommon. It occurs in about 10 percent of recognized pregnancies. Four out of five cases occur in the first trimester. Many women miscarry before they know they’re pregnant. About half of miscarriages are because of abnormalities in the fetal chromosomes. These defects are usually incompatible with life, and spontaneous abortions occur. The chance of an early pregnancy loss rises with age. While it is less common in younger women, about 80 percent of pregnancies in 45-year-old women can end this way. Without randomized controlled trials, which really aren’t possible here, we can’t know for sure what is causing many miscarriages not involving chromosomal abnormalities. We have a great deal of information about what is associated with them, but that is not the same. A woman who has health problems in general is more likely to suffer early pregnancy loss than one who does not. Women with high blood pressure, diabetes and thyroid disease are at higher risk. So are those who have hormone problems, immune disorders or infections. Circumstances at work can be associated with miscarriages. A 2013 systematic review found that working nights was a risk factor, as were things like working in a three-shift schedule, working 40 to 52 hours per week, and standing for six to eight hours per day. Smoking has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, according to a meta-analysis that included 98 studies. Obesity has also been linked to recurrent miscarriage. To be clear, there is no evidence that any of the factors I’ve mentioned causes a miscarriage. All of these data arise from observational studies that investigate associations, not causes. It’s easy to make an erroneous leap from one to the other. Smoking, obesity and night-shift work are each associated with being poorer and having fewer resources for health. This probably wouldn’t stop some people from quickly blaming women for their choices rather than considering their socioeconomic status. Ask almost any medical professional what caused a miscarriage, especially one early in pregnancy, and — other than chromosomal abnormalities — they will say that “we do not know.” If medical professionals cannot make that determination, it’s hard to understand how someone in law enforcement might. A bigger concern is that a fear of becoming part of an investigation may cause women to avoid medical care. Women who are bleeding or are heading toward septic shock may not come to the emergency room or doctor’s office. They could die. This would only increase America’s maternal mortality rate, which is already much higher than that of most other advanced nations. John Becker, a state representative in Ohio, recently sponsored a bill that would also change how pregnant women with unsustainable pregnancies are treated. He suggested that ectopic pregnancies, which are not viable, should in part be handled by “removing the embryo from the fallopian tube and then reinserting it in the uterus so that’s defined as not an abortion.” This procedure is not possible. It’s not clear that those who are writing many of these bills understand how pregnancy works. We do know some things about how miscarriage works: It’s a common, natural and unavoidable health outcome for many heartbroken people. Inserting politicians and the criminal justice system into the grieving process seems as if it could only cause further pain.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Privacy Is an Antitrust Issue,"The demise of Facebook’s competition has put our data at risk. Ms. Srinivasan is an antitrust scholar. As Facebook has generated scandal after scandal in recent years, critics have started to wonder how we might use antitrust laws to rein in the company’s power. But many of the most pressing concerns about Facebook are its privacy abuses, which unlike price gouging, price discrimination or exclusive dealing, are not immediately recognized as antitrust violations. Is there an antitrust case to be made against Facebook on privacy grounds? Yes, there is. In March, when Representative David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook’s potential violations of antitrust laws, he cited not only Facebook’s acquisitions (such as Instagram and WhatsApp), but also evidence that Facebook was “using its monopoly power to degrade” the quality of its service “below what a competitive marketplace would allow.” It is this last point, which I made in a law journal article cited by Mr. Cicilline, that promises to change how antitrust law will protect the American public in the era of Big Tech: namely, that consumers can suffer at the hands of monopolies because companies like Facebook lock in users with promises to protect their data and privacy — only to break those promises once competitors in the marketplace have been eliminated. To see what I mean, let’s go back to the mid-2000s, when Facebook was an upstart social media platform. To differentiate itself from the market leader, Myspace, Facebook publicly pledged itself to privacy. Privacy provided its competitive advantage, with the company going so far as to promise users, “We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user.” When Facebook later attempted to change this bargain with users, the threat of losing its customers to its competitors forced the company to reverse course. In 2007, for example, Facebook introduced a program that recorded users’ activity on third-party sites and inserted it into the News Feed. Following public outrage and a class-action lawsuit, Facebook ended the program. “We’ve made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we’ve made even more with how we’ve handled them,” Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a public apology. [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.] This sort of thing happened regularly for years. Facebook would try something sneaky, users would object and Facebook would back off. But then Facebook’s competition began to disappear. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Later in 2014, Google announced that it would fold its social network Orkut. Emboldened by the decline of market threats, Facebook revoked its users’ ability to vote on changes to its privacy policies and then (almost simultaneously with Google’s exit from the social media market) changed its privacy pact with users. This is how Facebook usurped our privacy: with the help of its market dominance. The price of using Facebook has stayed the same over the years (it’s free to join and use), but the cost of using it, calculated in terms of the amount of data that users now must provide, is an order of magnitude above what it was when Facebook faced real competition. It is hard to believe that the Facebook of 2019, which is so consuming of and reckless with our data, was once the privacy-protecting Facebook of 2004. When users today sign up for Facebook, they agree to allow the company to track their activity across more than eight million websites and mobile applications that are connected to the internet. They cannot opt out of this. The ubiquitous tracking of consumers online allows Facebook to collect exponentially more data about them than it originally could, which it can use to its financial advantage. And while users can control some of the ways in which Facebook uses their data by adjusting their privacy settings, if you choose to leave Facebook, the company still subjects you to surveillance — but you no longer have access to the settings. Staying on the platform is the only effective way to manage its harms. Lowering the quality of a company’s services in this manner has always been one way a monopoly can squeeze consumers after it corners a market. If you go all the way back to the landmark “case of monopolies” in 17th-century England, for example, you find a court sanctioning a monopoly for fear that it might control either price or the quality of services. But we must now aggressively enforce this antitrust principle to handle the problems of our modern economy. Our government should undertake the important task of restoring to the American people something they bargained for in the first place — their privacy. Dina Srinivasan is an antitrust scholar.

2019,Why Rewards for Loyal Spenders Are ‘a Honey Pot for Hackers’,"The punch cards stuffed in your wallet know next to nothing about you, except maybe how many frozen yogurts you still need to buy to get a free one. But loyalty programs, as they shift from paper and plastic to apps and websites, are increasingly tracking a currency that can be more valuable than how much you spend: personal data. As a result, the programs know things about you that some of your friends may not, like your favorite flavor (mango), when your cravings strike (early afternoon) and how you pay (with your Visa), in addition to billing details and contact information. Hackers are in close pursuit. One loyalty-fraud prevention group estimates, conservatively, that $1 billion a year is lost to crime related to the programs. As a share of fraud not involving a physical payment card, such schemes more than doubled from 2017 to 2018, according to the Javelin Strategy & Research firm. Some criminals use stolen credentials to impersonate customers, breach loyalty profiles and then tap into separate accounts. Others deplete balances or sell points on dark web marketplaces. One hacked Southwest Airlines rewards account with at least 50,000 miles was advertised for $98.88, according to the cloud security company Armor. In a data breach revealed last year as one of the largest ever, thieves attacked Marriott’s Starwood unit, stealing the personal information — including five million unencrypted passport numbers — of more than 350 million customers and Starwood Preferred Guest members. Data stored in Dunkin’ Donuts’ DD Perks program was also exposed in an attack disclosed last year. This year, several McDonald’s customers in Canada complained that criminals had breached their accounts on the chain’s loyalty app, My McD’s, and placed unauthorized orders, some totaling more than $1,000. A McDonald’s spokesman said that the company was aware of “some isolated incidents” involving fraudulent purchases but was “confident in the security of the app.” Loyalty programs are “almost a honey pot for hackers,” said Kevin Lee, a risk expert for the digital security firm Sift. They tend to be, he said, “the path of least resistance”: easy to sign up for, shielded by flimsy passwords and often neglected by users. The programs, and their appetite for data, have grown, but security has not kept pace. Daniel Najera was hit twice. On April 9, he received a series of emails about his Hilton Honors account. Within an hour, the account had been linked to Amazon and all 80,000 of his Hilton points had been used to make purchases. He said he had not taken those steps, and he feared that his Hilton account information, including his credit card number, might have been stolen. Hilton said it had “the appropriate security and fraud protection measures in place.” The company also said it had reinstated Mr. Najera’s points after he reported the intrusion. Mr. Najera, a chef who lives in Saginaw, Mich., said something similar had happened to his Buffalo Wild Wings loyalty account earlier this year. Signing into the app to participate in a March Madness contest, he saw that all 9,700 of his points had been spent in Fresno, Calif. Alison Glenn, a spokeswoman for the chain, said it was aware of “a small number of robotic attempts to hack passwords” that appeared to have failed. Mr. Najera said the company had replaced his points. “It kind of makes you wonder whether you still want to do this, whether it’s safe,” he said. “These programs try to get you to put all this information in there, and it’s worrisome.” There are at least 3.8 billion rewards memberships in the United States, more than 10 per consumer, according to research from LoyaltyOne, a loyalty advisory company. Companies use the programs to tailor deals and services to faithful patrons willing to divulge birth dates, payment card numbers, location data — even shoe sizes and favorite vacation spots. The information is analyzed for insight into how to appeal to customers individually to encourage even more spending. In the past year, Exxon Mobil, PetSmart, Victoria’s Secret and Uber have started or revamped loyalty programs. Hospitals, utilities, wineries and publishing houses are experimenting. Jaguar Land Rover, in a test, rewards drivers with cryptocurrency if they enable data-transmission technology in their cars. Rewards memberships have become “the single best source of individual customer data relevant to developing personalized marketing,” said Thomas O’Toole, executive director of the Kellogg School of Management’s data analytics program at Northwestern University. “That’s where the ballgame is heading,” he said. It’s not hard to see why, given how lucrative loyalty can be. Before Nordstrom started its Nordy Club last fall, the 10 million members of the program’s previous incarnation outspent nonmembers four to one, the retailer said. The 10-year-old rewards program at Starbucks accounts for 40 percent of purchases at the company’s United States stores, and membership has surged more than 25 percent in the past two years. Last month, Starbucks added tiers of rewards that can be redeemed more quickly than in the past. Members may receive personalized ordering suggestions, like cold brew infused with nitrogen bubbles for customers known to drink the regular version. Some brands have hooked their rewards to other companies. Walgreens offers points to shoppers who connect their accounts to Fitbit fitness trackers. In March, Chipotle briefly promoted a new loyalty program with cash prizes for consumers who also used the social payments app Venmo. Participants submitted the phone number associated with their Venmo accounts on a website created by Chipotle. Companies are collecting so much data that it is often “more than they can actually use,” said Emily Collins, an analyst with Forrester Research. “They’ve got oceans of data and puddles of insight,” she said. As consumers hand over more data, many of them fail to monitor their accounts closely. More than half of the rewards memberships in the United States are inactive, and more than $100 billion a year in rewards points go unredeemed, according to the marketing firm Bond Brand Loyalty. Tate Holcombe, a photographer in Arlington, Va., said he was usually “pretty religious about changing passwords and multiple verifications,” especially for accounts linked to payment data. With rewards programs, he was much more lax. “Of course, that’s the one place I got hacked,” he said. On March 23, Mr. Holcombe woke up at home to a 3 a.m. notification from his Domino’s loyalty account: His pizza was ready for pickup in Santa Clarita, Calif. Someone had hacked his profile and used a coupon for a free pizza, he said. Personal details, like his phone number and address, had been overwritten with gibberish. When he complained, the company replaced his coupon. Jenny Fouracre, a Domino’s spokeswoman, said the chain had “significant controls around the protection of loyalty accounts.” Although recycling a password across multiple accounts makes many customers vulnerable, she said, “information secured by us has never been compromised.” After experiencing repeated attacks, credit card companies and banks “have battened down the hatches” and become harder to breach, said Marti Beller, the president of Kobie Marketing, which designs rewards systems. She said loyalty programs needed to do the same because “they have real currencies with real values.” Some brands are strengthening their defenses with stricter login requirements like two-factor authentication and facial recognition. McDonald’s said its app replaced payment card information with a series of randomly generated numbers that protect accounts from data theft, but not from fraudulent purchases. Many companies are also hiring digital security firms like Sift. About 34,000 websites and apps use the company’s services. Sift has access to troves of data its clients collect on loyalty programs and can track the individual customers’ behavioral patterns across multiple accounts, analyzing them for possible fraud. It is data protection fueled by data. When someone orders a latte from a cafe chain’s app, Sift can tell that the person is in New York using the same iPhone linked to past purchases. If, two minutes later, a clothing store account registered to the same person shows activity from an Android phone in Florida, Sift flags the transaction as suspicious. Sift’s omniscience might feel invasive, as if consumers were pledging loyalty at the expense of privacy. But to security experts like Mr. Lee, the trade-off could be worse. “Fraudsters are collaborating on the dark web about the different ways to exploit loyalty programs,” he said. “We’re leveling the playing field on the other side.” Opinion",The New York Times
2019,Why Robert Mueller Should Testify on TV,"Critic’s Notebook The special counsel really doesn’t want to talk to Congress about his report. That makes him the best person to do it. On Wednesday morning, Robert S. Mueller III made clear that he was done with this. He had spent two years on his investigation. There is a report. You can read it for free. You can download it to your Kindle. You can buy it with an introduction by Alan Dershowitz. Mr. Mueller, his body language practically shouted, did not do this for fun. But he did it. He put everything together. He was not going to come to your house and personally read it to you. Yet the effects of Mr. Mueller’s grudging TV foray, as zesty as a slice of white toast, showed that coming to our houses and personally reading the report to us is precisely what he should do. At least he should do it virtually, by giving televised testimony to Congress. Mr. Mueller’s reservations, such as I can guess at them, are likely well-founded. His testimony would be a circus. It would hurl him into the cable TV blab-o-sphere. His words would be spliced and tweaked and twisted in bad faith and maybe digitally altered on Facebook. But if he honestly believes there was nonpartisan value in investigating the integrity of our elections and of the presidency, then there are good reasons for him to detail out the findings where people will notice them: God bless Mr. Mueller for his quaint faith in his fellow citizens, but let’s be honest. This is America. We wait for the movie, or the TV adaptation. After Mr. Mueller’s appearance, cable news buzzed with a breaking story, long available to anyone with an internet connection, that Mr. Mueller had intimated the possibility that the president had obstructed justice. Democratic candidates — who presumably at least have staff to read reports for them — came out for impeachment proceedings. After Mr. Mueller submitted his report, he made the doomed assumption of many a longform journalist: That people would read his full work and draw conclusions then and only then. That allowed Attorney General William P. Barr to become the editor who writes the clickbait headline for all the browsers who never actually read the piece. You can choose not to tell your story in the format people actually pay attention to. You do not get to choose whether it will be told. If there’s interest enough, as Mr. Mueller has now seen, it will be told for you, incompletely, selectively and to someone else’s tastes. Fine, some Americans do read. Or they read analyses written by people who did do the reading. Yet even for these hardy print types, there’s a power to images and voices on a screen. Look at the landscape of entertainment TV today. “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Catch-22,” “Outlander” — all works based on volumes that are out there for the reading. It’s human nature to want to see and hear a thing and to be moved by its actual appearance. No sooner had Mr. Mueller spoken than journalists (who, presumably, at least knew his report’s conclusions already) began saying how “huge” it was. It’s easy to ding them for marveling over something you’d hope they’d already read. But what was huge was that Mr. Mueller chose to emphasize it on camera. TV events concentrate attention and focus. It’s true of the finale of “Game of Thrones.” And it’s true when the special counsel announces a statement out of the blue. Everything Mr. Mueller said on Wednesday was also true on Tuesday. But it was news on Wednesday. There’s a certain Groucho Marx, “I don’t want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member” catch to how people receive public testimony. If you believe you have witnessed a wrong, the conscientious thing is to tell people about it. But the more eagerly and prolifically you tell, the easier for people to paint you as self-aggrandizing or having an agenda. It’s the James Comey factor. By saying, “I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner,” Mr. Mueller effectively de-Comeyfied himself. It would be hard to cast Mr. Mueller as a camera-thirsty Michael Avenatti type, though surely someone will try. He has a certain Joe Friday, just-the-facts affect that practically doesn’t exist in this TV age, except for comic effect in figures like the stoic Capt. Holt of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” You will not mistake Mr. Mueller for a “Scandal” character. This does not make for great TV in the Hollywood sense. It probably reflects a mind-set that made Mr. Mueller stubborn about, or oblivious to, how a TV culture would hijack his narrative. And that mind-set is likely why he fears that “The Mueller Show,” live before a congressional studio audience, would be a polarizing spectacle. But perversely, that makes him the best person to star in it.",The New York Times
2019,Why Runners Shouldn’t Wear Flip-Flops,"It’s the start of sandal season, but wearing ones without the right support can lead to foot pain. Welcome to the Running newsletter! Every Saturday morning, we email runners with news, advice and some motivation to help you get up and running. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. For Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatrist in Silver Spring, Md., August and September aren’t just the transition from summer into fall. Instead, she calls that time of year “plantar fasciitis season” The culprit? Flip-flops. “Everyone’s been wearing flip-flops all summer,” said Dr. Parthasarathy, a spokeswoman for the American Podiatric Medical Association. “We have so many people come in the door.” I get why people love flip-flops. I went to college in Florida and spent a good chunk of my pre-running, writing years covering the Jersey Shore, and wore them all the time. Flip-flops are easy to take on and off, usually cheap and come in a million patterns and colors. They’re also terrible for your feet — especially if you’re a runner. [Read more about plantar fasciitis. | Try this stretch to help relieve it.] “Flip-flops don’t provide any support. There’s no structure,” Dr. Parthasarathy said. “Your feet have to work much harder to grip the flip-flop.” That means you’re overusing your muscles, especially in the posterior compartment of the leg, where a lot of your running muscles are located, she said. “If your feet are working so hard during the day, then you go for a run, it’s extra stress on all your muscles and ligaments.” That doesn’t mean runners can’t wear any sandals — sometimes it’s a requirement if you smash up your toes, or your feet swell because of a hot run. And if you shower in locker rooms or other places where a lot of other people do, flip-flops can offer some protection against athlete’s foot. Dr. Parthasarathy, who is also a runner, opts for Birkenstocks, which have structure to them (I’m a fan too, preferring the new candy-colored, water-friendly ones, while Dr. Parthasarathy is all about cork). If you don’t want to wear what my mother still calls “hippie shoes,” look for a sandal that you can’t easily bend in half. Also, something with a strap that goes across the back of your foot will mean less stress on your muscles (though she adds something like a Birkenstock has enough structure in the rest of the shoe that it’s not necessary). When I want that kind of strap support, I opt for Chacos (I bought mine for hiking the Narrows at Zion National Park and they scream “I like hiking and the outdoors no matter how weird my sandals look!” but Chacos just released solid color versions that I find very tempting and has customizable options). (No, I’m not being paid to talk about these brands, and these aren’t affiliate links. I just like the shoes.) My go-to post-running shoe is still another pair of running shoes, especially now that I’m running again post-stress fracture. But what open-toed shoes do you wear, runners, if you wear them at all? Let me know — I’m @byjenamiller on Twitter. My mom likes the bumpy Adidas Adissage Slides, which hurt my feet (but this is an opportunity to wish a very happy Mother’s Day to the toughest lady I know — because her feet can stand up to those shoes, and for a lot of other reasons).

2019,Why Shailene Woodley Is Taking Ice Baths in Her Hotel Room,"Skin Deep The actress, who returns next week in “Big Little Lies,” is into natural products but likes her cake, too. Shailene Woodley, who has a full plate of projects, including the “Big Little Lies” Season 2 premiere on June 9 and two movies in the works, is as thoughtful with her beauty choices as she is with her career. Born in California, Ms. Woodley, 27, prefers her beauty products natural, meditates every single day and practices wellness rituals even in her hotel room. Find out what she’s into now. I travel so much that I don’t have a routine that I follow every single day. What I absolutely do every day, though, is shower more than anyone should. When I wake up, I shower. This is even before I run or work out or anything. I shower again after. When it comes to washing my face, I’m not a very fancy person. I keep the Juice Beauty facial wash in the shower. I bought it at a health food store years ago, and my skin seems to love it. But it doesn’t do a great job taking off makeup. For that, I use body wash on my face first, which I’m sure is not dermatologist recommended, and follow up with the Juice Beauty. On my body, I might use the Pure Fiji sugar scrub. I like the pineapple flavor because it reminds me of a man in my life, a delicious man. The scent is delicious, and he’s delicious. Right out of the shower, I use this body lotion called Nucifera. It feels good and smells nice. Then I brush my teeth — I’m a creature of habit and use the Jason Powersmile toothpaste — and put on deodorant. I switch between Agent Nateur and Meow Meow Tweet, which is all natural. It’s very hard to find natural deodorants that work well. But I find that if I rotate between these two, I smell less than with other natural deos. I’m into natural products. I try to be mindful of what I put on my body but also how it impacts the environment. But I have other products. I think it’s like saying you’re into fruit because you eat a lot a fruit, but you enjoy cake, too. If I have time, I have this African mud mask by Nyakio. It can take off a full face of makeup. I was staying at the Bowery Hotel years ago, and I sat down next to this woman at the bar, and we hit it off. We had drinks and everything. This is her line, and she sent me some of her products. I’ve been using them for years. I switch between a few of my products depending on what time of the month it is. Let me tell you, during ovulation and on my cycle, my skin does very different things. Most days I use Skinceuticals C E Ferulic serum. It blasts your skin with antioxidants. And then I put on the Nyakio chamomile sleep mask — day and night, actually. I use this brand Ilia — their True Skin foundation. It’s also the foundation I use on “Big Little Lies,” so you know it can do the job to cover up breakouts. If I want it lighter, I use one of those makeup sponges, and it evens out my skin while letting it breathe. I have a Chanel palette that I absolutely love. That’s what I take with me in my purse when I’m out. It has a highlighter, a blush and a concealer. I’m usually pretty chill when it comes to eye makeup. If I want a little definition, I use a black or brown eye pencil. At the moment I’m using this brand called W3ll People. I really dig the eyeliner because you can blend it easily. I do a chunky line and smudge it all around with my finger. I use mascara by Tarte — it’s the one in the bamboo casing — in black or brown. If I want to use eye shadow, I have a mix. I love the Dior palettes, the ones with five different colors, and Urban Decay. Efficiency is really important to me, so I like that the Dior and Chanel palettes are slim and easy to pack but also have a lot of colors. Right now, I wear Lake & Skye 11 11. I use the roll-on instead of the spray. I also use Santal by Le Labo. I like their candles a lot, and I feel like my clothing takes on the scent. My hair has been bleached, dyed black, bleached and dyed black, probably five times in the last year and a half. Luckily, I found this salon in Paris, David Mallett. He has this amazing treatment — it’s called the Tokyo treatment — that is next-level incredible. Look, I’ve done a lot of treatments, and I have never done anything that actually restored my hair to where it was before I dyed it. Otherwise, I use Kevin.Murphy Hydrate-Me line for my shampoo and conditioner. They leave my hair feeling soft. If I want to style it, I tend not to use any heat. I use Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser’s Invisible Oil Balm-to-Oil Pre-Shampoo Masque. I put it on my hair when it’s dry, and it makes it look wet and oily in a good way. I have very thick hair. When I wear it in a ponytail, it’s the size of a horse’s tail. The masque tames it but also makes it easy to style. I meditate every single day without fail. Sometimes it’s three minutes, sometimes it’s an hour and a half. I can be in the center of the storm and watch everything in the tornado go around me. Another thing I started doing recently has been helpful for my psyche, and that’s cold plunges. If I have bathtub wherever I am, I get a bag of ice and fill it. I sit in the ice bath for two to three minutes or, really, as long as I can stand. I do that three times back and forth between a hot shower. It’s more effective than vitamin C or echinacea for kicking a cold. I studied herbalism for a long time, which led me to studying nutrition. I care deeply about and am intellectually invested in what I consume. It’s not just to protect my own longevity, it’s recognizing that my daily diet decisions have an impact on future generations. I very much eat everything, though. I’m not gluten free or meat free. But I’m very conscious of what I choose. For example, I don’t eat meat every day. If I eat fish, which is rarely, I make sure it’s wild caught. I’m also very routine oriented. My breakfast is porridge, and lunch and dinner is a combination of veggies, carbs and protein. But I try not to take things too seriously. It’s very easy to feel guilty about your choices, and if it brings stress, then bye-bye. I’m really into low-impact fitness. It just feels better for my body. I’m also a big class person because it’s motivating. I’m a Scorpio, so I’ve got a lot of competition in my blood. But for me it’s about feeling good. That and making sure I laugh a lot.",The New York Times
2019,Why The Times Is Taking Down Its Paywall for 3 Days,"As we mark World Press Freedom Day, our international editor asks each of us to imagine what would happen around the world if journalists, and the public, were not watching. Some years back, when I was a correspondent in the Middle East, I had occasion to witness a peaceful uprising in a Persian Gulf nation. It was an exhilarating moment. Tens of thousands of people poured into the street chanting for an end to corruption, their mood buoyant as they expressed the simple wish for a better future. Government forces responded with gunfire. I am now The New York Times’s international editor, overseeing correspondents covering the world. When I was asked to write about World Press Freedom Day — a United Nations invention that once seemed like a nice acknowledgment and now feels more important than ever — my thoughts returned to that afternoon when the gunfire broke out. After the shooting was over, grieving families pulled me into a morgue. They wanted a witness. Three bodies riddled with buckshot were laid out on cold metal tables, and one young man, very much alive, was leaning over his dead brother, gently caressing his face, kissing his cheeks, crying. I will never forget the image of their hands intertwined, one yellow and cold, the other trembling. The government tried to do what governments always try to do: change the narrative. It said its forces had been fighting terrorists. But I was there. I saw the police shooting at peaceful protesters. And I worked for a news organization that had sent me there to report what I saw. We are living at a moment in history when democratic values are under threat by authoritarian leaders. The internet, which holds such promise as a democratizing force, has been co-opted by people peddling divisive, hateful ideologies. Citizens around the world who want to speak out are under siege from their own governments. Imagine if no one were watching. Imagine if The Times were not able to report from Venezuela. The government there has tried to keep us out and has attacked our correspondents for their reporting because there is something it doesn’t want you to know: Infants in Venezuela are dying of malnutrition. Imagine if we were not in Yemen, where a Saudi-led military coalition has prompted the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. Imagine if we were not at the fence between Israel and Gaza as troops faced thousands of protesters hoping to crash through. Imagine if we were not in Mexico to reveal how the previous government used advanced spyware to attack and undermine civil society. Every day, journalists at The Times and other mission-driven, independent news organizations around the world work hard to hold the powerful to account. To celebrate their work and press freedom, The Times is taking down its paywall from May 3 to 5 so everyone who registers can browse as many articles as they like. As you read today’s news, or some of the remarkable stories I mention here, consider: What if no one were watching? Patrick Kingsley, a correspondent based in Berlin, may never have documented how the leader of Hungary is dismantling the democratic state. Declan Walsh and Tyler Hicks may have been unable to make the world pay attention to starvation in Yemen. Michael Schwirtz’s eye-opening story about a Russian assassin and a president who never forgets a grievance may have never seen the light of day. When a dam burst in Brazil and buried more than 150 people in a tsunami of mud, The Times was there to ask who was responsible. When Grenfell Tower burned in London, killing 71 people, we revealed the lack of oversight and failed regulations that left tenants vulnerable. The siding that caused Grenfell to burn like a Roman candle was outlawed soon after our report. When our Southeast Asia bureau chief, Hannah Beech, wrote about an 11-year-old Thai girl married to a Malaysian man 30 years her senior, the outcry led the Thai government to bring her home. Ten days after Norimitsu Onishi and Selam Gebrekidan reported from South Africa that two children had drowned in the rudimentary latrines dug into the ground at their schools, the president announced a program to tackle the issue. We are not patting ourselves on the back. These days, in fact, we may be closer to wringing our hands. These reporters and their colleagues from publications like The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post often take great personal risk to bring you such stories, especially in this age of the strongman. Authoritarian leaders who once feared backlash from Washington if they went after American reporters now seem to be under the impression that they may get only a slap on the wrist — or even a nod and a wink. For decades, The Times made a point of chronicling events big and small. Ships arriving in New York Harbor. Less-than-earthshaking resolutions at the United Nations. We were known, after all, as “the Newspaper of Record.” We do less of that now. History has taken to recording itself. Ship movements, United Nations resolutions and presidential speeches are all available to the curious with just a few keystrokes. So are the deep and passing thoughts of virtually every celebrity, to say nothing of those who aren’t celebrities at all — or weren’t until they blew up on social media. And all that with no need to buy a newspaper. Yet in a world awash in information, bearing personal witness has become even more important. That is why World Press Freedom Day resonates this year, perhaps more than in the past. And that is why we are taking down The Times’s paywall for three days.

2019,Why Trump Can’t Get Enough of the Rose Garden,"WASHINGTON — The natural light is flattering. The entrance from the Oval Office’s French doors, and the ensuing walk down the colonnade, is richly symbolic. And the presidential podium perched on the steps in front of the manicured grass conveys power. The Rose Garden, a 125-foot-long French-style garden, has in recent months become President Trump’s preferred venue for public events at the White House, whether he is hosting athletes and world leaders, or pitching his own defeats as victories. He has insisted on the locale even when it has been uncomfortably cold. Mr. Trump, a showman and former reality show star with a keen interest in production values, has always cared deeply about the image he projects. Now in his third year in office, as Democratic presidential candidates sort through the process of choosing a nominee, Mr. Trump has increasingly embraced the Rose Garden — a literal interpretation of a time-tested strategy for incumbents seeking to harness the power of the presidency to secure their re-elections. President Gerald Ford employed a “Rose Garden strategy” in his 1976 re-election campaign, not leaving the White House for months in what was deemed by one aide to be a “no campaign campaign.” President Jimmy Carter followed his lead four years later, staying in the White House to weather the Iran hostage crisis. President George Bush was criticized for isolating himself from voters by running for re-election from the Oval Office. Mr. Trump appears to be trying a version of the strategy for himself. In the first five months of 2019, Mr. Trump has held at least 11 Rose Garden events — more than double the number of events he staged there during the first five months of 2017. This year Mr. Trump has chosen the Rose Garden to announce he was caving on his demand for a border wall and ending a 35-day government shutdown. He stood outside to declare a national emergency on the border with Mexico, amid opposition from lawmakers in his own party. He has made congressmen who did not wear coats shiver beside him while he bandied for over an hour with journalists. Mr. Trump chose the Rose Garden as the venue for a speech on his plan to overhaul parts of the nation’s immigration system, filling the chairs in front of him with Republican lawmakers who remain skeptical that he will be able to follow through with legislation. He has also used it to welcome the authoritarian president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro. The Rose Garden hosted a Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony, at which Mr. Trump praised the golfer Tiger Woods, his friend and business partner. It was where the president honored the Boston Red Sox, and where he took a rare turn in the audience for the anniversary of Melania Trump’s anti-bullying initiative, Be Best. The Rose Garden has been a key tool for White House communications operations for decades, often used as the backdrop for the signing of major pieces of legislation. “It’s not as formal as a statement from the East Room or behind the desk of the Oval Office,” said Lori Cox Han, a political-science professor at Chapman University, who wrote a paper about how presidents use the Rose Garden and other public activities. “But it’s one of those traditional, very presidential, settings that can work to the president’s advantage. You sign a bill that doesn’t have a lot of support in Congress, and it says, ‘I’m still the president,’ in this iconic setting. The perception is very important.” For Mr. Trump, it has also served as a venue for declaring victory prematurely. After the House voted to repeal most of the Affordable Care Act in May 2017, Mr. Trump staged a Rose Garden celebration with about 100 Republican lawmakers in attendance. The measure failed in the Senate two months later. Since he entered office, Mr. Trump has favored backdrops that portray strength. He pushed for a military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue that was ultimately scratched. More recently, he has explored putting himself at the center of the nationally televised fireworks display on July 4, and addressing the nation from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. That plan, however, is running into resistance from Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington. But the Rose Garden is one of the few outdoor venues he controls unilaterally. “He’s an indoor creature, but he wants to be seen outdoors,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian. “He likes the Oval Office because he could do the big signature and show power. But after a while, it becomes an image of a guy who is locked in a room. This is a deeply image-driven president. In the Rose Garden, he’s able to project that he’s outside and enjoying the compound.” Former aides said Mr. Trump loved how his complexion looked in the Rose Garden’s natural light, as well as its proximity to the Oval Office and that it felt like a “tourist destination” he could show off while hosting an event. Mr. Trump often requests the garden for events, former aides said. The one drawback for the president, according to two former aides, is the wind, which could tousle his hair. Mr. Trump is not atypical in his desire to get outdoors. President Barack Obama staged at least 25 Rose Garden events in his first year in office, according to the public papers of the presidents. “He’s from Hawaii,” said Dan Pfeiffer, who served as Mr. Obama’s communications director. “He liked being outside.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the circumstances that led President Jimmy Carter to stay in the White House during his re-election campaign. It was the Iran hostage crisis, not the Iran-contra affair.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Trump Likes Facebook,"It’s a huge social network, and it tolerates cheating. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. President Trump is making Facebook central to his re-election campaign. Trump’s 2020 campaign has spent around $5 million on Facebook ads this year, which is roughly half as much as the 23 Democratic candidates combined have spent, as The Times’s Thomas Kaplan and Sarah Almukhtar reported yesterday. Trump is relying on Facebook partly for the obvious reasons: It’s the country’s largest social media network and an excellent way to reach voters directly. That’s why Joe Biden has also started spending heavily on Facebook. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] But Facebook has another specific advantage for Trump: The company has been lax about combating disinformation. Despite pledges by top executives to do better than in 2016, the company has repeatedly failed to enforce its own policies this year, allowing the Trump campaign to post false or misleading ads. The Trump campaign likes Facebook in part because it tolerates rule breaking. A big part of the problem is Facebook’s reliance on spotty algorithms — and its refusal to spend the resources needed to regulate ads effectively, as Judd Legum, author of the Popular Information newsletter, has written. Legum’s reporting has exposed multiple recent violations that Facebook has failed to catch, even though he is an independent journalist and Facebook is a multibillion-dollar company. “The Trump campaign appears to be counting on the fact that Facebook does not have actual people reviewing their ads before publication,” Legum wrote recently. “There is nothing to stop them from simply re-running the same false ad.” I don’t expect Facebook to be perfect, but I do expect more competence in this area than the company has shown so far. Related: Writing about the company’s privacy violations, my colleague Kara Swisher recently said that Facebook has earned itself “fines, more investigations, smart laws, programs to help small innovative companies to thrive, whatever it takes.” Irony watch: Even as Trump benefits from Facebook’s sloppiness, he is criticizing Facebook for banning far-right figures, and he’s encouraging conservatives to share stories of being “censored” on social media.

2019,"Why Violence Is Spiking in Pockets of Brooklyn, Even as the City Gets Safer","Six shootings over the Memorial Day weekend reflect gang violence that is fueling a rise in killings this year in northern Brooklyn. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The sun was just setting on Memorial Day when gunshots ripped across St. Andrew’s Playground on Atlantic Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Three teenagers were wounded in the gunfire, the youngest being 16. It was one of six shootings during the holiday weekend that left 10 wounded and one dead in northern Brooklyn, where police have been wrestling to contain a steep rise in murders and shootings. Over all, murders and shootings have dropped in New York City to levels not seen since the 1950s. Murders so far this year are down 11 percent over the same period last year. But the spike in shootings in North Brooklyn over the first three months of the year, peaking at 22 in March, shows that the police have struggled to contain pockets of violence, often driven by gangs. Monday night’s shooting in Bedford-Stuyvesant appears to be part of a wave of tit-for-tat violence in the 79th Precinct between several street gangs, the police said, among them Brisp Nation, Gates Fam, Rich Fam, the Hoolies and the 900 gang. Those rivalries have helped drive up violent crime across northern Brooklyn, and Monday’s shooting has worried officials that the borough could be in for a violent summer. ""One shooting concerns us,"" said Deputy Chief Michael Kemper, the commanding officer of detectives in the precinct known as Brooklyn North, which includes neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and Brownsville. ""But to have six shootings over a holiday weekend is certainly concerning.” Why violence spikes in a place like north Brooklyn is a difficult problem to decipher and solve, and the phenomenon is not unique to New York, criminologists say. Last summer, Chicago wrestled with a rapidly rising murder rate, mostly on its South Side, before the trend leveled off at year’s end. By fall, Philadelphia was the city with a problem. This year, both South Central Los Angeles and northern Brooklyn are fighting to contain violent streaks. In neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights, police said the spike has been driven by violence between competing street crews, whose methods have changed since the 1990s, becoming more driven by social media and less predictable. “They have alliances, and they just don’t like one another,” said Chief Terence A. Monahan, the department’s highest-ranking uniformed officer. Today’s street gangs overwhelmingly consist of young teenagers, with allegiances that are tied to housing developments and individual blocks, rather than to national or regional groups, the police and community groups say. In past decades, feuds arose between gangs over control of drug-selling territory or other illicit businesses. But now beefs often blossom on social media over relatively minor matters — perceived insults or slights, investigators said. That makes the shootings more unpredictable and random and can happen in fast, concentrated bursts, the police said. “It’s not over drugs. It’s not over anything but, ‘You’re on the opposition. I don’t like you,’” said Chief Monahan. “That’s how it starts to spiral out of control.” Calls to action on social media often come with hashtags, as the crews air grievances and organize attacks. Detective George Harvey, who has worked in the 79th precinct, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, for 25 years, said gang members regularly post messages about disputes with other gangs, general activities and their movements. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, the police have linked many of the percolating street feuds to a shooting from July 4 of last year, when a rival gang, believed to be the Hoolies, opened fire at an outdoor party for members of Brisp Nation, Gates Fam and Rich Fam. “Maybe we have a problem,” Deputy Inspector Charlie Minch, the commanding officer of the 79th Precinct, recalled thinking. He was right. The ambush drove violence up that summer, and fueled the spike early this year. From Williamsburg to Brownsville, investigators say feuds between gangs have left a trail of killings and shootings, often foreshadowed digitally on social media. Courtney Tingle, 26, had written openly about his affiliation with the Crips on social media. He was murdered in March, just days after posting a warning that suggested a fellow Crip had made a pass at his girlfriend. Devontee Cameron, 19, often flashed gang signs in photos he posted on Facebook. He was shot and killed in Bushwick in January. And Davion Powell, 18, was shot and killed in broad daylight outside a Crown Heights apartment complex. He had published the name of his crew with a hashtag in posts on Facebook just hours earlier. The most gruesome recent example of gang violence was the March murder of Tyquan Eversley, 21. In security camera videos, Mr. Eversley was seen frantically running through the streets of East New York, pursued by at least seven men. He tripped as he attempted to escape over a fence. His assailants threw a brick at him and shot him to death. Four of those men have since been arrested and charged with murder. Mr. Eversley was targeted by a rival gang, said one law enforcement official, who did not go into further detail. These days, allegiances to national gangs like the Bloods, the Crips or Folk Nation are often trumped by loyalties to local gangs. People often join national gangs in jail for protection, but once they return home, most rejoin the street crews they grew up with. “These are the kids and the grandkids of the crack era,"" said P.I., an outreach worker for Save our Streets Bed-Stuy, a community group that works with local teenagers to stem gun violence. “They like to think they’re gangs. Everybody’s jacking that."" P.I. requested to be referred to only by his street name, to preserve his credibility with the youth in the area. For the past three months, the Police Department has thrown extra resources at north Brooklyn to stem the violence. Additional patrols have been sent to housing projects in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The police have also been meeting regularly with community leaders in Brownsville. Most significantly, in March, the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, and the Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, announced a new push to crack down on gun crimes in the borough. Gun arrests have increased by 10 percent as compared to the same time last year, to 545 from 494, Mr. Gonzalez’s office said. The police believe the approach is working, pointing to the department’s most recent crime statistics. Since peaking in March, shootings in Brooklyn have dropped. Murder numbers are returning to levels similar to the same period last year. Inspector Minch said the department gave his precinct eight additional officers in February and planned to send 17 recent graduates from the police academy to the command. “More than I’ve ever gotten,” he said. “It can help, having a surge in some way where you just have more visibility can displace violence, especially gun violence,” said John Roman, a fellow with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago who focuses on urban crime research. “At the end of the day you’ve got to understand what the disputes are about, and you’ve got to understand the nature of the dispute.” An earlier version of this article misstated John Roman's work affiliation.

2019,Why Violence Is Up in Pockets of Brooklyn,"[Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Thursday. Weather: Expect more of the same. There is a chance of showers, with thunderstorms, in the afternoon and evening. The high should reach the mid-70s. Alternate-side parking: Suspended today for Solemnity of the Ascension. Over the Memorial Day weekend, one person was killed and 10 were wounded in six separate shootings. And that was just in northern Brooklyn. Citywide, violent crimes have dropped to record lows. But in some neighborhoods, crime is stubbornly persistent. My colleague Ali Watkins wrote about shootings in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and other parts of northern Brooklyn, and what the police are doing to stop the violence. How violent are these pockets of crime? In northern Brooklyn, there have been 11 more shootings so far this year than there were a year ago. Over that same period, northern Queens had 10 additional shootings and northern Manhattan had 16 more. What is behind the violence? One answer is access to guns. Though New York City’s gun laws are restrictive, other cities and states have looser regulations. For years, law enforcement officials have complained about how guns illegally flow into New York with disturbing regularity. Another answer is gangs. Not all of the shootings in northern Brooklyn last weekend were gang-related, but at least one was part of what the police said was tit-for-tat retaliatory gang activity. The gangs, according to the police, include the Brisp Nation, Gates Fam, Rich Fam, the Hoolies and the 900 gang. Not familiar with these gang names? The gangs are often tied to housing developments and individual blocks, rather than to national or regional groups, the police and community groups say. What’s behind the violence? “They have alliances, and they just don’t like one another,” Chief Terence A. Monahan, the Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed officer, said about the gangs. “It’s not over drugs. It’s not over anything but: ‘You’re on the opposition. I don’t like you.’” What ignites the violence? A perceived slight, an observed snub, a discerning sense that one’s allies have been disrespected. It can be difficult to unpack the origin story of some feuds. The perpetrators in one story are, in their own telling, the victims in an earlier story. From Williamsburg to Brownsville, investigators say, these feuds have left a trail of killings and shootings that are often foreshadowed on social media. Calls to action on social media often come with hashtags, as the crews air grievances and organize attacks. Detective George Harvey, who has worked in the 79th Precinct, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, for 25 years, said gang members regularly post messages about disputes, their general activities and their movements.

The Times’s theater reporter, Michael Paulson, just wrote about Broadway’s box office boom. Nearly 15 million patrons saw Broadway shows last season, for a total box office gross of $1.8 billion, according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League, the trade association representing producers and theater owners. What’s behind the boom? Having a record number of tourists in the city certainly helps, Mr. Paulson reported. People who live outside the greater New York area make up 63 percent of Broadway attendees, according to an annual study of audience demographics conducted by the Broadway League. This season, there were 72 Broadway shows, including 38 musicals, 29 plays and five special events (including “Springsteen on Broadway,” which brought in $50 million). Whose show was the biggest? “Hamilton” grossed $165 million over the season (the best tickets regularly go for $849 apiece). Next was “The Lion King” with $116 million. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” made $105 million; it was the first nonmusical play to gross more than $100 million in a year. The most-attended show of the season was “Wicked,” which, playing in Broadway’s biggest house, drew 753,146 people. It’s Thursday — make a show of it.

2019,"Why Wages Are Finally Rising, 10 Years After the Recession","For years it was the central question in an otherwise impressive recovery by the American job market: Why aren’t wages rising faster? Unemployment was low. Hiring was strong. Corporate executives were complaining that they could not find people to fill all of the available jobs. Yet workers’ paychecks were growing only sluggishly, barely outpacing inflation. And then wage growth suddenly picked up. Average hourly earnings in April were 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier, the ninth straight month in which growth topped 3 percent, the Labor Department reported Friday. Other measures diverge on the exact timing and rate of increase, but not on the basic trend: Wage growth, long stuck in neutral, has at last found a higher gear. “We’ve spent several years going, ‘Where is the wage growth? Where is the wage growth?’” said Martha Gimbel, an economist for the job-search site Indeed. “And it turns out we just had to wait a few years for the labor market to get tighter.” The recent gains are going to those who need it most. Over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases, a shift from earlier in the recovery, when wage growth was concentrated at the top. The faster growth at the bottom is probably being fueled in part by recent minimum-wage increases in cities and states across the country. Research from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, found that over the past five years, wages for low-wage workers rose 13 percent in states that raised their minimum wages, compared with 8.4 percent in states that did not. But minimum wages are only part of the story. Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI, estimates that the minimum-wage increases account for a quarter to a third of low-wage workers’ gains over the past three years. The rest is most likely a result of a tightening labor market that is forcing employers to raise pay even for workers at the bottom of the earnings ladder. Ms. Gimbel noted that better-paying industries had experienced faster job growth in recent months, while the fastest wage growth had been in lower-paying industries. That could indicate that sectors like health care and manufacturing are snapping up workers, forcing retailers and restaurants to raise pay to compete. Still, not everyone is benefiting equally. African-American workers have seen smaller gains over the course of the recovery, for example. And wage growth remains slow in some parts of the country that were hit especially hard by the recession. [One challenge has been to provide better-paid jobs to workers without a bachelor’s degree. Here’s a look at where to find them.] Many economists were puzzled by the slow pace of pay increases because it looked as if a fundamental relationship had broken down. Decades ago, economists observed that when unemployment falls, wages tend to rise, as companies are forced to offer higher pay to attract workers. Yet even as the unemployment rate fell from 10 percent in 2009 to less than 5 percent in 2016, wages rose slowly. Even now, with the unemployment rate near multidecade lows, wages are not rising as quickly as standard models suggest they should be. Economists proposed all sorts of theories to explain the mystery: Globalization and automation meant that Americans were competing against lower-paid workers overseas and against robots at home. The rising power of the biggest corporations, paired with falling rates of unionization, made it harder for workers to negotiate for higher pay. Sluggish productivity growth meant that companies couldn’t raise pay without eating into profits. The recent uptick in wage growth suggests a simpler explanation: Perhaps the job market wasn’t as good as the unemployment rate made it look. The government’s official definition of unemployment is relatively narrow. It counts only people actively looking for work, which means it leaves out many students, stay-at-home parents or others who might like jobs if they were available. If employers have been tapping into that broader pool of potential labor, it could help explain why they haven’t been forced to raise wages faster. It appears as if that is exactly what is happening. In recent months, more than 70 percent of people getting jobs had not been counted as unemployed the previous month. That is well above historical levels, and a sign that the strong labor market is drawing people off the sidelines. “You look at those people who do not want a job, people who were out of the labor market due to disability, all of those people are coming back in,” said Adam Ozimek, an economist who has studied the issue. Several years ago, Mr. Ozimek discovered that with a broader definition of unemployment — lacking a job, for any reason, while in one’s prime working years — wage growth had been in line with historical expectations throughout the recovery. That relationship has held up as the job market has improved. In other words, he argued, the wage-growth “mystery” wasn’t a mystery at all. Three percent is hardly a breakneck pace for wage growth. In the tight labor market of the late 1990s and early 2000s, wage growth for nonsupervisory workers topped 4 percent for several years without causing runaway inflation. Mr. Ozimek sees no reason that history can’t repeat. Hiring remains strong, suggesting that companies are still able to find the workers they need, even if they have to work a bit harder to get them. Inflation is not just tame; it is actually slowing, meaning Federal Reserve policymakers are unlikely to see faster wage growth as a reason to raise interest rates, at least in the short term. But some economists still see evidence that the economy has shifted in ways that make it harder for workers to win raises. Elise Gould, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said that it took an unusually tight labor market to deliver stronger wage growth, and that even now there has been no significant increase in the share of corporate earnings going to workers. “Why does the unemployment rate have to be at or below 4 percent before you see stronger wage growth?” Ms. Gould asked. “Why do employers have all the leverage? Why do they have all the power? It’s because the labor market dynamics have changed.” There are signs that wage growth has leveled off recently. The employment cost index, a more sophisticated wage measure that accounts for changes among the industries that are hiring, rose a bit more slowly in early 2019 than it did in late 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this week. The most potent threat to wage growth, however, may be an end to the decade-old economic expansion. The 2008-9 recession cut short the last recovery just as wages were beginning to pick up. And while most economists see little risk of a recession today, even a modest slowdown could make companies cautious about handing out raises, said Julia Pollak, an economist for the job site ZipRecruiter. “You need two things” for wage growth, Ms. Pollak said. “You need labor-market tightness and also employer optimism about demand.” If that optimism fades, she said, wage growth could go with it.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why We Should Stop Fetishizing Privacy,"Big tech companies create jobs, encourage innovation and provide valuable services free. Why would we want to break them up? Ms. Messer is a technology investor and entrepreneur. Media coverage of the threat to personal privacy from technology tends to follow a narrative in which privacy is a virtue, Big Tech its evil predator and government the good knight capable of protecting it. But this narrative ignores the realities of modern life and may lead to devastating trade-offs. It fetishizes privacy, demonizes technology and assumes that government is the right institution to protect us. We live in a networked world. The internet is built for sharing things at little to no cost. We forward our emails, capture photos on cellphones and tweet opinions, all activities that leave a trail of data that can be collected without our knowledge. Privacy — the right to be free from unwanted intrusion — no longer exists in an absolute sense. Regulating tech companies could create problems worse than the ones we seek to solve. The biggest companies — led by Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google in the United States, and Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent in China — are data networks, aggregating information to provide valuable services underwritten by advertising, e-commerce or user subscriptions. They have all become both hugely profitable and vital to the global economy. The Department of Labor estimates that employment in the computer and information technology sectors in the United States will grow 12 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. The companies also provide income to millions of non-employees, including Airbnb hosts, Instagram influencers, eBay sellers, and Uber and Lyft drivers. If we constrict their fuel — data — we may hurt not only the quality, cost and speed of their services, but also the drivers of growth for the world’s economy. Innovation will also suffer. Our culture celebrates entrepreneurship and accepts failure as part of the process. As a result, the United States has been the architect of the new economy. But privacy evangelists have made villains of the very companies the world emulates. Rather than debate how to expand this economic opportunity, they call for fettering it. The evangelists assert that regulating access to data or breaking up big companies will put that data back in our control. But this is naïve. We share our photos, emails and other personal data daily. Almost any individual or company, big or small, can collect and misuse it. Size doesn’t make a difference. If safety is the actual goal of protecting privacy, consider this: Large tech companies may be our best line of defense against hackers, state surveillance and terrorists. These companies have the talent and resources to match well-funded and sophisticated adversaries. As the threat of cyberwarfare grows, shouldn’t we consider whether it would be prudent to break up companies that are our best allies against foreign and criminal intrusion? Regulation also assumes that lawmakers understand how the internet operates. But many of the questions asked of the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg at his most recent congressional hearing reflected a staggering display of ignorance about the businesses that have fueled America’s economic growth for over a decade. Consumers, on the other hand, potentially can have more influence over these companies. When those companies violate the public’s trust, the news travels fast — often on the platforms themselves — and people stop visiting the sites, causing them to lose revenue. After a scary internet meme known as Momo spread, millions of parents unplugged their children from YouTube. Consumer uproar over a bug in FaceTime that allowed eavesdropping led to an emergency ad campaign by Apple. Privacy advocates often point to European privacy rules as a model for the United States. Under those rules, the General Data Protection Regulation, companies that operate in Europe or handle European data are required to obtain consent before collecting data. They also must provide users with the “right to be forgotten” — the ability to delete their information upon request. In theory this might sound beneficial. But some services we highly value, such as spam filters, require analyzing emails quickly — and without consent. Allowing everyone “the right to be forgotten” will enable people to erase information about bad actions that society might benefit from seeing. And do we really want to emulate European rules if they undermine competitiveness? With the uncertainty over how to comply with those rules, entrepreneurs have looked to markets on other continents, strengthening big companies that can afford to pay big penalties for their privacy violations. The rules make it more costly to build a data network, which could explain why there are no European rivals to America and China’s big companies. The lack of data networks will make it much more difficult for Europe to compete in building artificial intelligence applications that could allow us to live longer, more fulfilling lives, precisely because they collect and store huge amounts of data, which in turn makes algorithms more accurate. Engineers today are focusing on using artificial intelligence not just to improve shopping and social networks, but also to cure diseases, provide clean energy and better manage food supply and transportation systems. My own company, Collective[i], is a data network that uses machine learning to help companies manage revenue with the goals increasing economic prosperity and reducing layoffs created by uncertainty. [Technology has made our lives easier. But it also means that your data is no longer your own. We’ll examine who is hoarding your information — and give you a guide for what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.] Expecting government to sort this all out reflects a blind trust that defies historical experience. The Fourth Amendment was written to protect against arbitrary searches and seizures of property by the government. Regardless of how you feel about WikiLeaks or Edward Snowden, they revealed that governments are watching us. People forget that Apple has fought to protect the privacy of iPhone users from the F.B.I. And that the Chinese government uses access to data to stifle dissent and profile minority groups. Finally, it is time to stop glorifying anonymity. In the internet underworld known as the dark web, where users go to be anonymous, there are no Facebooks or Googles to set standards for speech, no opt-out provisions for individual users, no trail of data the authorities can use to prevent or prosecute crimes. Young people who have grown up on the internet — so-called digital natives — have a much more nuanced view of privacy. They start with an awareness that their data isn’t private. They aren’t shocked that companies collect it, perhaps because they know that this collection enables them to get valuable services free. They know their texts can be sent all over the internet, that any of their emails can be forwarded to anyone else, that their chat rooms can be infiltrated by strangers — with or without their consent. But if a platform violates their trust, they stop using it. If we untether ourselves from the old paradigms, we can open our minds to real solutions to expand opportunity and innovation while ensuring our safety. Where privacy is actually the issue, our laws should focus on deterring companies, institutions and individuals from misusing data to cause actual harms, such as slander, harassment, human trafficking, discrimination, fraud and corruption. The big tech companies are neither heroes nor villains in this narrative. They create jobs and render certain jobs obsolete. They amplify the best and worst things about us. Simply saying that privacy infringements seem “creepy” or “scary” does not justify regulating all of these corporations. Progress is a messy business. Instead of trying to preserve what was, let’s realistically debate the world we want. Privacy is a relatively modern idea, born of human progress. It should continue to evolve as we continue to progress. Heidi Messer, a technology entrepreneur and investor, is a co-founder of Collective[i].

2019,Why We Spent 7 Years Documenting Syria’s Secret Torture Prisons,"Times Insider Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. Some stories are so big and encompassing, they are like the air: hard to see, taken for granted and somehow all at once too obvious and too hard to grasp and prove. When I started covering Syria’s internal conflict in 2012, as Beirut bureau chief for The Times, President Bashar al-Assad’s sprawling system of torture prisons, though omnipresent, was hidden in the background. Of course, we covered the arrests of protesters and stories of torture. But they weren’t new — they were what everyone knew the government had always done. What was new was the indiscriminate state violence, escalating in plain sight: the first artillery attack, the first airstrike, the first use of chemical weapons. We focused on visible war crimes — ones we witnessed in person or quickly verified through witnesses and videos. We saw a toddler’s skin clinging to a tricycle; puddles of blood in a Damascus University cafeteria; a child’s hand holding a book bag, no longer connected to a body. By contrast, detention, torture and execution were unfolding unseen in secret dungeons, recorded mainly in the minds of survivors. Many were too traumatized or afraid to speak. But as years and detentions piled up, the evidence ripened, like layers of dead leaves transforming into usable soil. It became clear the system had vastly expanded. Talking to hundreds of Syrians, my team and I noticed that nearly every person with the slightest connection to opposition activities — and many with none — had a relative “disappeared” by security forces. We began to hear detailed witness accounts of torture and neglect, so dark and sadistic that they were almost unbelievable — even, sometimes, to the survivors themselves. Bit by bit, I found people willing to trust me completely with their stories. I heard every technical detail of the arrests, beatings, torture methods and forced confessions. There were large courtyards packed with detainees, “as if all of Syria had been arrested,” one survivor told me. Some images kept coming back to me: a prisoner locked up alone with a decaying corpse for so long that he hallucinated that it was talking to him; detainees hung for hours by one arm from a hook in a meat truck as it traveled over bumpy roads; an interrogator pausing while torturing a prisoner to speak tenderly on a cellphone to a young child; a teenager dying slowly, racked by pain and infections, after guards doused his own torso with fuel and set him alight; a lawyer forced to eat his own feces. Seeing the prison system for ourselves was nearly impossible; the government gave only occasional visas for tightly controlled visits. But in 2013, we got a partial glimpse. A businessman close to the Assads took me and my team to a security facility to meet prisoners he said were foreign jihadists who would prove to us that the uprising was driven not by a homegrown protest movement but by extremist Islamist terrorists. It was my most ethically compromising moment as a journalist. A line of prisoners, hunched over and handcuffed to one another, some limping — beating the soles of the feet is a common torture method — were led through a drab courtyard and, one by one, sat across from me in an office. Behind me was a portrait of the former president of Syria, Hafez al-Assad; flanking me were the jailers. My colleague, Hwaida Saad, and I told each prisoner that we were independent journalists, that they could tell us anything they wanted or nothing. But in reality there was no way they could safely speak freely or refuse. The prisoners turned out to be mostly Syrians. Several gave nearly identical, implausible accounts: They had no political views, but had been approached by a religious leader out of the blue, and had been given money and drugs in exchange for engaging in random violence. One of them did not stick to his lines. A walnut seller from a working-class suburb, he had protested, he said, “for, like, freedom.” What did that mean to him? He said he wanted to vote in a meaningful election. I worry to this day about what happened to him afterward. We left feeling physically shaken. Our minders mocked us for “feeling sorry for them.” We redoubled efforts to cover the story, as human rights groups steadily compiled data on dozens of torture facilities, tens of thousands of disappeared Syrians and thousands of executions of civilian oppositionists after sham trials. A defector, who went by the pseudonym Caesar, escaped with photographs of thousands of starved, bruised detainee corpses. But in 2014, the foreign jihadists of the Islamic State seized the spotlight. They enslaved and raped minority Yazidis and executed foreign journalists on camera — actions designed and packaged for public consumption, calculated to terrify. Mr. Assad took the opposite approach, keeping his torture system behind closed doors, insisting he presided over an ordinary, rule-of-law justice system and was a bulwark against Islamic State barbarism. But according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, the number of Syrians documented as disappeared by the Islamic State, based on the terrorist group’s public broadcasts of its atrocities (around 5,000), is dwarfed by the number missing in government detention (127,000), where sexual assault is also rampant. (Both numbers are likely undercounts.) In 2016, I had the chance to ask Mr. Assad directly about prisoners, especially those not accused of any violence. He repeated that anyone in prison had committed a crime, that there was a justice system at work. I asked about specific prisoners who had simply disappeared after being taken by security forces, like Adel Barazi, the brother of an old friend of mine, whose relatives had been asking the authorities about him for four years. Mr. Assad became testy, suggesting that they were lying or that they should simply keep asking — although detainees’ family members have sometimes been arrested just for that. I decided we had to gather more rigorous evidence to move the story beyond Mr. Assad’s “he said, she said” approach. As time passed, more and more detainees disappeared — but at the same time, it became more and more possible to corroborate survivors’ stories. Gradually, more people got their entire families out of Syria, and became willing to go on the record with their full names. The accounts of the survivors of rape and sadistic torture featured in our investigation bolstered dozens of others who had spoken on the record or anonymously. My colleagues and I spent grueling weeks in Turkey, Germany and Lebanon listening to hours of survivors’ detailed recollections and cross-referencing them. One survivor in Düsseldorf, still hollow-eyed and nervous after his ordeal, was so desperate to tell his story to help others that he was still calling out details as our departing train pulled away. I had gained new skills in reporting on survivors of trauma from a fellowship at the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma on how to interview sensitively without sacrificing rigor. Time brought new context and urgency, like the global trend of growing authoritarianism and mass incarceration. Many Syrians who wanted a secular, civil-society state — including those who had earlier risked their lives to document bombings — focused more and more on documenting detention. So Syrian and international organizations began to merge their documentation efforts. One group, the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, sifted through 800,000 Syrian government documents. Among them were memos showing the ordering of mass arrests of protesters, as well as discussions among security officials of deadly torture and neglect inside the system, which I eventually persuaded them to show me. Among my most important finds in their files were documents backing up the account of Mariam Khleif, who told us of being systematically raped by the investigation chief of a detention facility. One government memo mentioned her by name as a detainee; others showed that the man she named was indeed the commander there. A separate witness had told CIJA of similar treatment by the same man in the same facility during the same period. I was one of few journalists to speak directly to Caesar, over Skype, and learned of more memos he had smuggled out, documenting deaths of specific detainees who were later identified in his photos by their families. We chose to feature survivors whose accounts were supported by similar ones from survivors of the same facilities, by documents in their possession and by smuggled Syrian government documents. Their stories are still only the tip of the iceberg. Adel Barazi is still missing. His mother died recently, with no news of him.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why We Still Care About America’s Founders,"Opinion Despite their flaws, their struggle continues to speak to the nation we want to become. In 1770, in what became known as the Boston Massacre, British soldiers opened fire on angry colonists, killing five.CreditCreditStock Montage, via Getty Images Mr. Atkinson is the author of “The British Are Coming: The War for America, Lexington to Princeton, 1775-1777.” There’s a lot to dislike about the founding fathers and the war they and others fought for American independence. The stirring assertion that “all men are created equal” did not, of course, apply to 500,000 black slaves — one in five of all souls occupying the 13 colonies when those words were written in 1776. Nor was it valid for Native Americans, women or indigents. Those who remained loyal to the British crown, and even fence-straddlers skeptical of armed rebellion, were often subjected to dreadful treatment, including public shaming, torture, exile and execution. In a defensive war waged for liberty and to secure basic rights, the Americans invaded Canada in an effort to win by force of arms what could not be won by negotiation and blandishment — a 14th colony. The enduring image of a yeoman farmer leaving his plow in the furrow to grab a musket on behalf of freedom is mostly mythical; during the Revolution, George Washington’s army was rarely larger than 20,000 troops and on occasion dwindled to 3,000, in a country of two and a half million. And yet, the creation story of America’s founding remains valid, vivid and exhilarating. At a time when national unity is elusive, when our partisan rancor seems ever more toxic, when the simple concept of truth is disputed, that story informs who we are, where we came from, what our forebears believed and — perhaps the profoundest question any people can ask themselves — what they were willing to die for. What can we learn from that ancient quarrel? First, that this nation was born bickering; disputation is in the national genome. Second, that there are foundational truths that not only are indeed true, but also, as the Declaration of Independence insists, “self-evident.” Third, that leaders worthy of our enduring admiration rise to the occasion with acumen, grit, wisdom and grace. And fourth, that whatever trials befall us today, we have overcome greater perils. The American Revolution was not a war between regimes or dynasties, fought for territory or the usual commercial advantages. It was an improvised struggle between two peoples of a common heritage who, over decades, had been sundered by divergent values and conflicting visions of the world. The Americans eventually won by embracing fewer strategic misconceptions than the British did. Certainly Yankees could be wrongheaded, in believing they had greater economic leverage over the mother country than they actually possessed, for example, or in caricaturing King George III. The monarch would sit on his throne for 60 years and was shrewder, more complex and more creditable than the overbearing ninny who still dominates our imaginations and who even today minces across the stage in “Hamilton.” But George and his ministers made three critical miscalculations: that most colonists remained loyal to the crown, notwithstanding troublemakers in New England capable of inciting a rabble; that firmness, including military firepower, would intimidate the obstreperous and restore harmony before France and other European powers hostile to Britain could intervene; and that failure to reassert London’s authority in America would eventually unstitch the newly created British Empire, encouraging insurrections in Ireland, Canada, the Caribbean and India — an 18th-century version of the domino theory that started the American adventure in Vietnam two centuries later. Britain also underestimated the difficulty of waging a protracted war across 3,000 miles of open ocean in the age of sail. The British Army in the Revolution, unable to gather food and forage from the American countryside without being ambushed, relied largely on provisions shipped from English and Irish ports. But of 40 transport vessels dispatched across the Atlantic in the winter of 1775-76, only eight reached the king’s forces in occupied Boston directly; the rest were blown by gales back to Britain or to the Caribbean, or were intercepted by rebel marauders. Of 550 Lincolnshire sheep carried aboard those ships that actually made it — that breed was deemed the “fittest to undergo the voyage” — only 40 arrived alive. Of 290 hogs, just 74 survived, and most of the 5,200 barrels of flour in one shipment turned rancid. When Gen. William Howe, the British commander in New York the following summer, requested 950 horses to pull his artillery carriages and supply wagons, 412 died during the trip, and scores more were ruined beyond use. The Americans had only to avoid losing the war, while the British had to win it — an enormous advantage for any force fighting on its own turf. We rightly esteem American endurance, pertinacity and sacrifice, not only by those serving in the ranks but also by others swept up in the fraught events. “Pray come home as soon as possible,” Lois Peters of Connecticut wrote her husband, Capt. Nathan Peters, whom she had not seen in months. “A visit from you at any time would be agreeable.” In the meantime she would harvest the corn, sell their oxen for enough cash to keep the family saddlery solvent, sew him a shirt — and “take great pleasure doing it” — and keep faith with the future. She signed her letter, “Your loving wife until dead.” The sheer drama of the Revolution keeps it compelling and often thrilling, from the bloodletting at Bunker Hill, where one of every eight British officers killed during the long war would die in four hours, to the skin-of-the-teeth escape by Washington and his army in the fog across the East River in August 1776, after a terrible drubbing on Long Island. Beyond the battlefield, the theatrical power and pathos of the conflict surely outruns any dramatist’s imagination: the abrupt arrival of the septuagenarian Benjamin Franklin in Paris to woo the French monarchy into an alliance with radical republicans; the 100,000 smallpox deaths in North America from 1775 to 1782; those white men sitting in Philadelphia in the summer of 1776, lashing at horseflies with their handkerchiefs while carving up Thomas Jefferson’s draft declaration to make it shorter and better; the many American families — Franklin’s among them — ripped apart by irreconcilable political differences. If the central figures in our creation story have frequently been embalmed in reverence, they nonetheless remain beguiling, worthy of perpetual scrutiny and, often, of emulation. Washington is a case in point. Yes, he owned more than 300 slaves at his death in 1799. As a tactical commander he did poorly at Long Island, Fort Washington and other battlefields. The man who proverbially would never tell a lie sure could prevaricate, and Washington’s carping about his troops, his officers and his lot in life — “I distrust everything,” he grumbled in 1776 — transforms the demigod into a sometimes petulant mortal. Yet great responsibility enlarged him: Washington rightly embodies the sacrifice of personal interests to a greater good, as well as other republican virtues — probity, dignity, moral stamina, incorruptibility — that should remain true north for every citizen today. “Affliction is the good man’s shining time,” Abigail Adams said of him. Lesser personalities, largely lost to history, speak to us of constancy and an antique patriotism. “Heaven only knows what may be my fate,” Capt. John Macpherson wrote in a last letter to his father before being killed at Quebec. “I experience no reluctance in this cause, to venture a life which I consider is only lent to be used when my country demands it.” Likewise, Lt. Samuel Cooper wrote his wife, “The dangers we are to encounter I know not, but it shall never be said to my children: Your father was a coward.” He, too, died at Quebec. Even Benedict Arnold, perhaps the finest battle captain on either side early in the war before his subsequent perfidy, wrote after being shot in the leg in Canada, “I am in the way of duty and I know no fear.” The Revolution not only brought forth a nation, afire with a sense of destiny; it also embodied the enduring aspirations of an idealistic people. No wonder the world was agog. “The cause of America,” the essayist Thomas Paine wrote, “is the cause of all mankind.” Even now, the war for independence offers clues to our national temperament; it remains a bright mirror in which we see traits that fashion the American character, from ingenuity and resilience to brutality and pugnacity. We’ve come far in almost two and a half centuries — in power, diversity, tolerance and sheer scale. But in some respects those ancestors remain nearer than we know. Their existential struggle churned up issues that perplex us to this day, including individual liberty versus collective security, the proper limits on executive power, the obligations of citizenship and the elusive quest for a more equitable society. The tacit, primal question of 1776 persists in 2019: Who do we want to be? “Democracy is never a thing done,” wrote Archibald MacLeish, the poet and librarian of Congress. “Democracy is always something that a nation must be doing.” The American Revolution lasted 3,089 days, and the result was epochal and enduring — the creation of the American Republic, among mankind’s most remarkable achievements. Nearly 90,000 more days have elapsed since those horsefly-swatting men asserted a human birthright of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Keeping faith with those who fought, suffered and died for the principles we profess to still cherish requires more than a nodding acquaintance with them, more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their struggles. For better and for worse, their story is our story. Their fight remains our fight.

2019,Why Won’t My Kid Stop Pretending to Be a Lion?,"Extended imaginary play is normal for preschoolers. Here are some tips for corralling your little animals. [Sign up to receive NYT Parenting in your inbox every Wednesday] A lot of parenting questions boil down to: Is this a thing, or is something wrong? We’re doing an occasional series explaining why certain things seem to happen to your kid (or to your body or to your relationships) as your child grows. This week, we’re answering a reader’s question about why her child won’t stop acting like a lion. Read our first column, about preschoolers’ questions about death, here. If you have a question for a future “Is this a thing?” newsletter, email us. Q: My 4-year-old runs around the house on all fours all. of. the. time. She thinks she’s a lion, and if you are talking about something else, doing something else or asking HER to do something else, forget it. She’s a lion and will not answer any questions asked in English. She must roar her every reply. This can be particularly exhausting when it comes to getting her to eat her breakfast (a zebra), or getting her shoes (paws) on, or getting her to school (the savanna) without an extensive round of make-believe before I’ve even had my coffee. Is this a thing? — Kelly Walsh, East Bay, Calif. A: I chose this question because I’m going through a version of it myself. Every time I try to tell my almost 3-year-old something she doesn’t want to hear, she meows at me. It’s adorable and aggravating and, honestly, I’m kind of impressed at the exquisite aggression of it. I wish I could meow at people in meetings sometimes instead of responding pleasantly to unreasonable requests. But let’s back up. There are two separate questions lurking in this letter: Is it normal for kids to engage in extended pretend play? And how do you snap them out of it when you need them to get out the door in the morning? To answer these questions, I interviewed two psychologists, one of whom has done research on imaginary play. Here’s what they said. Why do preschoolers love pretending to be animals? It’s typical behavior for the under-5 set to pretend to be animals (or to role-play adult professions or fantasy characters), said Dr. Tracy Gleason, a professor of psychology at Wellesley College who has studied preschoolers’ imaginary play. “They’re doing a lot of exploring of what it’s like to be someone else, to feel something else, to interact in different ways with other people” at that age, she said. The cognitive developmental task children are working on through this exploration is called “theory of mind,” said Dr. Gleason. It’s the idea that “other people have thoughts, and those thoughts can be different from your thoughts,” she explained. Children may begin grasping the “theory of mind"" concept at around 18 months, but it takes years to fully understand that, as the psychologist Andrew N. Meltzoff put it, other humans are “more than dynamic bags of skin that can be seen, heard and weighed.” By pretending to be other people and beings, and sometimes creating imaginary friends, children may be working on a deeper understanding that other people have thoughts, feelings and beliefs they don’t know about and can’t see on the surface. How do you put boundaries on the animal play? If you can figure out your child’s intentions, said Dr. Yamalis Diaz, a clinical assistant professor of psychology at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone, you can figure out how to address their behavior. In general, there are four common reasons your child might role play as an animal at this age: to avoid something (meowing instead of responding to a question), to get attention (negative attention counts!), to get something they want (asking for milk with a roar) or to communicate something (this is particularly important for kids who don’t yet have strong language skills). Dr. Diaz wanted to make clear, if a kid is being a lion at appropriate times, “we don’t want to squish their imaginations.” Dr. Gleason concurred and added that kids this age often feel powerless, so it’s helpful to be empathetic to their lack of control over their lives and to give them choices when it is reasonable. Those caveats noted, here is advice for how to put healthy boundaries on play that is inconvenient or that is being used as a sneaky delaying tactic. Set a timer. If you don’t have time nor patience for an extended romp on the savanna, let your child know in advance that their play will be limited, and then set a timer (on your phone or elsewhere) for 2 minutes. When the alarm goes off, your child will know lion time is over. Use your words. If the play is coming out at the wrong times (when you’re trying to get your kid dressed, or at your local house of worship, for example), set guidelines for when the play is appropriate using child-friendly language, Dr. Diaz suggested. “Leon the Lion can come out to play after you get dressed,” or during a break at church, or whatever the situation may be. You can also choose to interpret the meows or roars in ways that your preschooler is not excited about, said Dr. Gleason. If your kid keeps meowing at dinner, you can say, “Oh, I guess that meow means you’d like to eat all of your broccoli now.” That should get them using human words pretty quick. Take your attention away. If the meowing is being used to get extra (yet unnecessary) attention, ignore their behavior, said Dr. Diaz, and give attention only to the right behavior. If you ask your child a question and she only meows or roars despite having the language skills to express herself, you can say, “I will keep talking to you as soon as your big girl voice comes back,” and walk away until she’s prepared to talk to you in human words. If the child is the one requesting something, the request should not be granted until she asks as a person, not as a lion. Offer support. If your child is in fact struggling to communicate, give him a language assist. If he’s asking for a crayon by pointing to the object and using a grunt or a roar, for example, point to the crayon and say, “You want the crayon? O.K., I will give you this crayon.” If he’s meowing when he gets upset, try to get him to use those emotion words, too. “You seem sad. Are you sad? Can we take a deep breath and talk about what’s wrong?” P.S. Forward this email to a friend with a meowing preschooler. Follow us on Instagram @NYTParenting. Join us on Facebook.

2019,Why Working Till Whenever Is a Risky Retirement Strategy,"Retiring Cleo Parker had a simple plan before retiring: She would work well into her 60s as a marketing analyst in the automotive business. But recently, she has been searching for a Plan B. In 2006, just as she was about to turn 50, Ms. Parker’s longtime marketing job with a Detroit-area advertising agency was eliminated. For the next decade, she worked a series of short-term-contract and full-time positions — many in the volatile auto industry, which has reduced employment levels drastically since the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Parker’s last full-time job, as a marketing analyst for a pet supply retail chain, evaporated in 2018. Ms. Parker has since interviewed for more than 30 positions. At age 62, she often finds herself chasing jobs for which she is overqualified and that pay far less than what she had been earning. “First, you have to deal with persuading people you are O.K. with a salary level at or below your last position,” she said. Age discrimination also has been a barrier, she suspects: “I feel they often have a vision of an eager person younger than themselves walking into the job, and while I tend to be very enthusiastic, I am not younger than anyone I’ve interviewed with in many years.” Ms. Parker’s story is a cautionary tale for anyone planning to postpone retirement and work indefinitely: It’s a fine aspiration, but it’s best to have a backup plan. Many Americans understand that working longer can be a good way to improve retirement security. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 33 percent of workers expect to retire between the ages of 65 and 69, and 34 percent at 70 or beyond, or not at all. Yet a recent study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found that 37 percent of workers retired earlier than planned — and that the odds of success fell as the goal became more ambitious. In that study, among the 21 percent of workers who said they intended to work to age 66 or later, 55 percent failed to reach that target. The most common causes for unexpected early retirement are health problems and job loss, said Geoff Sanzenbacher, associate director of research at the center. He was quick to note, however, that the study, based on data from the long-running University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study, offers clear reasons for unplanned early retirement only in about one-quarter of cases. Other reasons, Mr. Sanzenbacher suspects, are more difficult to measure. The pull of leisure activities and time with family are factors, he thinks, along with possible age discrimination. But the quality of work also matters. “Do you feel motivated to go to work, and feel like you are accomplishing something?” Mr. Sanzenbacher said. “That can wear on older people nearing retirement faster than they might think.” Labor-force participation rates for workers 62 and older have been rising over the past 25 years, according to research by Richard W. Johnson, director of the program on retirement policy at the Urban Institute. But the increases have occurred mostly among better educated workers. “Participation rates have increased about three times as fast for college grads than high school dropouts,” Mr. Johnson said, “mainly because college grads tend to be healthier, they don’t usually work at physically demanding jobs, and employers value them.” Working longer makes it easier to delay your Social Security benefit claim, increasing monthly benefit amounts through delayed retirement credits. Working longer can also mean more years of saving for retirement and fewer years relying on savings in retirement. But counting on working longer to make a retirement plan work is fraught with risk — even during times when the labor market is healthy. The unemployment rate for workers 55 and older in April was just 2.6 percent, according to the Department of Labor — a full percentage point lower than the overall unemployment rate. But long-term unemployment is higher for older workers: 26.6 percent had been out of work 27 weeks or more last month, compared with 22.2 percent of all workers. “Yes, the unemployment rate is low, but if you get laid off, the chances of ever really recovering are not very good,” said Marc Miller, a career coach in Austin, Tex., who specializes in advising older workers on career shifts. Even those who do find new jobs don’t return to their earlier income levels, Mr. Johnson said. “You’d be lucky to get half as much as you were making — it’s a big hit at any age, but it’s so much worse when you’re older because you have so little time to recoup those losses. There’s not much time to reset your retirement planning before you stop working.” Ms. Parker and her husband, Mike, a technician specializing in small engine repair who also lost his job late last year, had hoped to retire on their retirement account savings and Social Security, but the couple has been forced to tap those savings sooner than expected, along with some money Ms. Parker inherited from her mother. Some of the I.R.A. drawdowns occurred before she turned age 59½, but those came from a Roth account, so she was able to avoid paying early withdrawal penalties. Ms. Parker thinks her savings will last until she turns 80, but isn’t completely sure, she said. “This is a topic that makes me really uncomfortable, so I am not studying when we start circling the drain on a very frequent basis,” she said. At this point, Ms. Parker is seeking full-time work and hoping to postpone filing for Social Security until her full retirement age of 66. She expects the couple’s combined Social Security benefit to provide $4,000 in monthly income. She wants to work as long as possible, partly to support her lifelong passion for dogs — she has four bull terriers and participates in dog shows and other competitive events. “I want to find work I enjoy and that would give me the time to show my dogs,” she said. These days, Ms. Parker is working to develop a new career offering her marketing skills to dog-related businesses. She started a blog about dog marketing and is hoping to make a living working in that business. But she doesn’t expect her income to come close to the six figures she made earlier in her career. Sporadic income can be especially damaging to household finances. Elizabeth White, an international development expert specializing in sub-Saharan Africa, was making $200,000 a year as a consultant when the economic crisis hit in 2008. Her consulting income disappeared, and she turned to a mix of consulting gigs, writing and speaking engagements. “You have these big income gaps in between consulting assignments,” she said. “By the time you get something, you owe everybody and your mother; you’re in the hole again. You get, and you lose.” A 2016 essay that Ms. White wrote for PBS NextAvenue about her employment crisis drew widespread attention on social media, ultimately opening the door to publication of her recent book, “55, Underemployed and Faking Normal.” A TED talk that she gave on the topic in 2017 has been viewed more than 1.5 million times. Now 65, Ms. White has burned through her retirement savings, but owns her home in Washington with a low-rate mortgage that she is close to paying off. She is holding off on filing for Social Security until she reaches the full retirement age of 66 this year. Planning to work longer still makes sense, experts say; if anything, too many workers retire at less-than-optimal ages. Mr. Sanzenbacher’s research found that the most popular planned retirement ages are 62 and 65 — the first years of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare, respectively. “Neither of those ages maximizes an individual’s Social Security benefit, and claiming at 62 is far too early for most people,” he said. At the same time, Mr. Sanzenbacher added, it is crucial to understand the odds of hitting your target date. He urges workers to make an honest assessment of their health and how that might affect the plan. “When you make a plan, think realistically about your health,” he said. “If you are planning to work to 65 and you already have health problems in your late 50s, that plan may not work.” Mr. Miller, the career coach, urges anyone hoping to work into the 60s or 70s to make a realistic assessment of future job risk well ahead of that time. “If you think you are safe, then you are probably smoking something, and you are inhaling,” he said. “If you want to work through your 60s and even into your 70s, you need to do the planning now.” Even that may not be enough protection for your plan, so what about that Plan B? Said Mr. Johnson: “You want to save as much as you can while you’re still working.” An earlier version of this article misstated the source of some retirement funds tapped by Cleo Parker. She drew on a Roth Individual Retirement Account, not a traditional I.R.A., and did not have to pay early withdrawal penalties.",The New York Times
2019,"Why You Need a Network of Low-Stakes, Casual Friendships","Weak ties can offer strong rewards. When I was laid off in 2015, I told people about it the way any good millennial would: By tweeting it. My hope was that someone on the fringes of my social sphere would point me to potential opportunities. To my surprise, the gambit worked. Shortly after my public plea for employment, a friend of a friend sent me a Facebook message alerting me to an opening in her department. Three rounds of interviews later, this acquaintance was my boss. (She’s now one of my closest friends). Think of the parents you see in the drop-off line at school. Your favorite bartender. The other dog owners at the park. The sociologist Mark Granovetter calls these low-stakes relationships “weak ties.” Not only can these connections affect our job prospects, they also can have a positive impact on our well-being by helping us feel more connected to other social groups, according to Dr. Granovetter’s research. Other studies have shown weak ties can offer recommendations (I found my accountant via a weak tie) and empower us to be more empathetic. We’re likely to feel less lonely, too, research shows. A 2014 study found that the more weak ties a person has (neighbors, a barista at the neighborhood coffee shop or fellow members in a spin class), the happier they feel. Maintaining this network of acquaintances also contributes to one’s sense of belonging to a community, researchers found. Instead of considering these minor brushes of socialization throwaway interactions, cultivating low-stakes relationships can pay dividends. Here’s why you should exchange pleasantries the next time you see a friendly face when you’re out and about. The desire to belong and form social attachments is a basic human need, alongside food, sleep and safety. But once we hit 25, the number of friends we have peaks and begins to slowly dwindle over time, according to a 2016 study. As we get older and priorities shift from after-work bowling league to after-school pickup, maintaining a loaded social calendar becomes less essential. Staying socially engaged, then, is integral to personal fulfillment. In her work examining social interactions, Gillian Sandstrom, a senior lecturer of psychology at the University of Essex, found that maintaining a network of low-stakes connections further enmeshes us in our community, especially after a major move away from family and close friends or the loss of a loved one. “A lot of us think it’s not worth our time to have those kinds of interactions, that they can’t possibly provide any meaning,” Dr. Sandstrom said. “We’re focused on whatever is next and we don’t stop and take that second to enjoy the moment.” [Like what you’re reading? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.] Taking a few minutes to engage with people we see regularly or joining a group — such as a religious group, a sports team or a hobby meetup — has been shown to increase our satisfaction with life. Where you convene with acquaintances matters, too. Settings like a bar or a company party encourage mingling with people who may be on the outskirts of our social circles, said Nicholas Epley, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. However, by cultivating low-level friendships at places we frequent, like church or PTA meetings, we’re able to create valuable mini-networks, said Miriam Kirmayer, a therapist and friendship expert. “We can have friends or acquaintances in different contexts who add meaning to our lives in their own way,” she said. “We have an acquaintance at work that we connect and talk about work projects, or dog-walking friends. It helps to have these different kinds of people in our lives to add different kinds of support.” Seeing acquaintances removed from their usual contexts can also help elevate these casual connections into genuine friend territory. A study from 2018 found that people formed a “casual” friendship after spending 30 hours together. While a 20-minute chat with your hairstylist outside the salon is far shy of dozens of hours, the interaction brings you closer to having more common ground. If conversations with our low-stakes friends are meaningful, we can expect to feel a degree of satisfaction similar to if we’d just spoken to a close friend, said Jeffrey Hall, an associate professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas. “Is it the case that people tend to reserve the most meaningful interactions of their day with their closest relational partners? Yes,” Dr. Hall said. “Is it also the case that if people act in meaningful ways that they can build a close relationship with somebody and feel good about that interaction? Yes.” Having at least a few acquaintances can connect us with a larger circle of people, which is fantastic news for job hunters. Even if our friends want to help us find a job, the weak ties are often the ones who widen the job-search playing field, Dr. Sandstrom said. “The people we know that we’re close to tend to know the same things we do and so it doesn’t expand our information,” Dr. Sandstrom said. “The argument is we have more to learn from the people that we don’t already know so well.” Regularly interacting with people who have different experiences than we do allows us to be more mindful of others’ circumstances, according Dr. Epley. This, in turn, builds empathy. As research has shown, more empathetic people are more likely to be sought out by peers for comfort. But we’re not necessarily hard-wired for meaningful casual encounters. In his research, Dr. Epley found that people often enjoyed striking up conversations with strangers on their commutes to work, but were not likely to do so because they believed the ride would be more pleasant in silence or assumed the other person wouldn’t find the dialogue interesting. Still, low-stakes friends have a lot to offer, and uncovering surprising tidbits about the regular players in one’s life — discovering that your neighbor is an accomplished dancer, for instance — can add a bit of texture to your day. “It’s a good thing to spice things up,” Dr. Sandstrom said. Want to relish in a full Rolodex of low-stakes friends? Here’s how you can get the most out of these relationships. Give yourself permission to talk to familiar faces. Dr. Sandstrom tells participants in her studies to speak to one new person a week. “I think people need to feel like it’s O.K.,” she said. “When you give people permission to talk and they take it, they enjoy it.” Shift your attitudes. Since research suggests talking with strangers is a pleasant experience and leaves us feeling fulfilled, there’s no reason to groan when your Uber driver strikes up a conversation. By altering your expectations around the level of enjoyment these conversations provide — both for you and the other person — you’re more likely to engage in the first place. Mirror an expert’s behavior. When she was growing up, Dr. Sandstrom watched her father interact with virtually everyone he encountered. As an adult, she adopted some of his conversational habits when speaking with acquaintances. Do you have friends who seem to strike up a conversation with everyone in the bar? Observe them: How do they initiate the exchange? What questions do they ask? What topics do they avoid? (For more on this, here are some tips on how to have better conversations.) Make the conversations meaningful. If your goal is for these low-stakes friendships to evolve into something more significant, it’s important for these exchanges to be high quality, Dr. Hall said. “When we have that sense of connection with somebody, it accelerates the process by which we try to take action to create a deeper friendship.”",The New York Times
2019,Why You Should Care About the State Democratic Party Convention,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you want to get California Today by email.) Today, the California Democratic Party state convention kicks off in San Francisco. No, it’s not going to determine whom the party is endorsing in the presidential race. And, anyway, the party’s endorsement may not have much sway over California’s newly relevant presidential primary, if its move to back Kevin de León’s unsuccessful bid to oust Senator Dianne Feinstein is any indication. Plus, the party’s leadership is mired in scandal, as a result of sexual harassment allegations that led Eric Bauman to resign his post as chairman late last year. So why should anyone but the most die-hard politicos care? I asked Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at Cal State L.A. He told me that it comes down to a couple of things: First, the convention will be as good as any early poll for observers hoping to get a read on which of the 23 Democratic presidential candidates may be able to make a dent in what is now a very important primary state. “It’s an audition,” Mr. Sonenshein said. “It may do a lot to eliminate some of the more marginal candidates as much as it will help clarify who’s at the top.” According to The Wall Street Journal, 14 of those candidates are set to speak to delegates at the convention, including all the ones considered front-runners, except for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And that, Mr. Sonenshein said, may be a signal in and of itself, that Mr. Biden is focusing more energy on high-dollar California donors and big-ticket endorsements, rather than courting members of the most progressive wing of the state’s multifaceted Democratic contingent. Second, he said, the election of a new chairperson could signal the direction of the state’s Democratic Party more broadly, which will most likely be important. Mr. Sonenshein said the 2016 presidential election opened a deep rift along the fault line of Senator Bernie Sanders vs. Hillary Clinton. The fight extended into 2017 with a bruising battle over Mr. Bauman’s election as chairman. “I think there are still going to be some leftover feelings from the last battle, which was so bitter between Clinton and Sanders forces,” Mr. Sonenshein said. “It really tore the party apart.” This weekend, Mr. Sonenshein said, the process of selecting a new leader could either signal a continuation of that debate, or a more cohesive future. “Donald Trump has turned out to be a tremendous unifier,” he said. (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

[The Salinas Californian] In an era when content is king, it’s rare for a decision not to publish something to capture much interest. Still, when the five student editors-in-chief of The Campanile opted to nix the big map showing where their classmates at Palo Alto High School were headed off to college, they had more than an inkling people would pay attention. They knew other members of their wealthy, traditionally high-achieving community in the heart of Silicon Valley were anticipating the school newspaper’s annual map issue, as The Mercury News reported. They had seen the widespread coverage of the vast college admissions scandal, which had touched both “Paly,” as the school is known, and nearby Stanford University. “This was the right time to take a stand,” said Leyton Ho, one of the student editors. The map, the editors said, celebrates a specific kind of post-high-school path: A super competitive four-year college. But as the admissions scandal laid bare, it’s a myth that with enough hard work, that path is accessible to everyone. And even if it were, it’s a myth that it’s always the best route. Nevertheless, Waverly Long, another editor, said the map loomed over the college application process like a kind of biblical text. And although the competition wasn’t always explicit, she said, it was there. “My friends were even pulling up past versions of the map, looking at where people went to school and talking about where they got in,” she said, recalling one coffee shop session. “Seeing the sort of conversations that the map encourages firsthand definitely had a role in me wanting to get rid of it.” Other Campanile staff members told me that while they understood the reasoning, they were disappointed to hear that they’d miss out on what felt like a rite of passage. Bernie Koen, a senior staff writer, said that not publishing the map was fixing a symptom and not the root causes of the more toxic elements of Paly’s culture. “The pressure of the situation will be there regardless,” he said. Either way, the editors said it’ll be up to their successors to decide whether to bring the map back. California Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

2019,Opinion | Why You Should Root for the Uber I.P.O. to Fail,"The fate of Uber’s stock is a verdict on the winner-take-all venture capital model that dominates Silicon Valley. Mr. Desai, a professor at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School, is the author of “How Finance Works.” Uber’s initial public offering — the biggest in a year of blockbusters — is yet another chance for Uber and its detractors to sell their competing ideas of what this company represents. As it heads toward a valuation of about $90 billion — nearly the combined value of General Motors and FedEx — Uber is packaging its new image as a socially oriented company led by a contrite chief executive facing an enormous potential market that it has only begun to explore. Skeptics see a company with significant legal exposure, a corrupt culture, declining profitability and slowing growth that has forced it to make an awkward pivot to less attractive businesses such as Uber Eats and Uber Freight. This clash of visions is why I.P.O.s are so much fun. But the Uber I.P.O. also signifies something deeper about changes in the entrepreneurial world that fuels the global economy. The most amazing part of Uber is not the magnitude of the losses that it has sustained — more than $10 billion in operating losses over the last three years — but that pre-I. P. O. investors have been willing to fund those losses by pouring in capital on an unprecedented scale, in the hope that they will reap the rewards when the stock enters the public markets. We should all root for a comeuppance for those investors, who have helped to debase the entrepreneurial system that is so important to the global economy. What would that comeuppance look like? It might look something like the performance of Lyft, Uber’s main rival, whose stock price is down 32 percent since it went public on March 29. When Uber’s shares begin trading on Friday, many of the underwriters, institutional investors and other early investors in the company will try to sell their shares. If the price falls immediately after the I.P.O., they will be badly disappointed. Such a “broken” I.P.O. is considered an embarrassment in Silicon Valley, and I.P.O.s are often underpriced to avoid them. The largest of Uber’s major shareholders is SB Cayman 2 Ltd., which holds more than 16 percent of Uber shares. That investment represents the SoftBank Vision Fund, a $100 billion mega-venture capital fund that has fundamentally changed the venture financing world. The fund, whose biggest investors are the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the founder of Japan’s leading internet company, has been writing enormous checks — ranging from $500 million to $5 billion — to start-ups including WeWork, Lemonade, Wirecard and DoorDash. SoftBank’s presence has inflated deal sizes in the venture capital world, where rounds of financing are typically well below $100 million. The underlying philosophy of the SoftBank Vision Fund is to create a “cluster of number one” companies that will enrich one another. The language is mystical and the strategy is vague, but, the “vision” is that the artificial intelligence revolution will offer enormous benefits to leading companies that can share their knowledge across different markets, so these companies can “win all without fighting.” There have been successes for SoftBank, including an investment in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. But the real verdict will be delivered in the next several years as their largest investments will come to fruition. So, why root for a broken I.P.O. for Uber? First, venture capital is supposed to be about finding good investments. SoftBank has made it all about size. The scale of the fund has transfixed the venture capital and investment management industries, as SoftBank makes ever-bigger and more unrealistic promises to sovereign wealth funds hoping for outsized returns. The economics of these very large funds are irresistible. Sovereign wealth funds, like Saudi Arabia’s, are willing to offer enormous incentives to the fund managers, on top of management fees that rise far more quickly with size than their underlying expenses. When writing large checks quickly — the only way to spend $100 billion — becomes more important than finding good investments, we know this will end poorly. This cycle — in which unsustainable start-ups make ever-larger promises to bloated venture capitalists, who promise more than they can deliver to flush sovereign wealth funds, who are too eager to believe them — distorts the allocation of capital and talent. The rush to invest, no matter the underlying economics, diverts entrepreneurial energy toward unviable business models. Consumers are often the beneficiaries: If you have enjoyed Uber’s discounted fares, you can thank the venture capital funds who have been willing to bankroll Uber’s fare subsidies. But when companies like Uber are valued so highly by the capital markets, investors and young people can be led astray. Young people come to view their jobs as lottery tickets that might deliver an enormous payday, rather than as a meaningful way to find their way in the world or as an opportunity to build a sustainable organization. And investors of all kinds, including mutual funds, begin to copy the strategy of these giant funds, dabbling in assets they know little about to chase returns. Finally, the venture capital world will become even more clubby. That clubbiness has its virtues: strong networks of successful investors and entrepreneurs help ensure that the best opportunities are funded. But, with the mega-venture capital model embodied by SoftBank, the advantage of larger players grows even larger. The companies with the largest funders can simply outlast others because they can sustain losses longer. Winning requires one of the deep-pocketed players, so companies are competing on funding rather than through their products. And when a mega-fund controls companies that are potential competitors, it might prefer less competition rather than more. A successful I.P.O. for Uber will validate and perpetuate the mega-venture capital model, and all the distortions that it entails. Rooting for a broken I.P.O. is not easy, and schadenfreude at the expense of the billionaire class is no justification. There are many exciting start-ups and diligent investors trying to figure out which ones to fund. The healthy functioning of that market is vital to our economy. But a broken I.P.O. for Uber might help restore some sanity to the broken venture financing industry. Mihir A.

2019,Opinion | Why You Should Start Binge-Reading Right Now,"Ditch Netflix for a novel. And not just because a novelist is telling you to. Mr. Dolnick is a novelist. One night a couple of summers ago, the power went out and, unable to watch Netflix or engage in my customary internet fugue, I lit a candle and picked up a thriller by Ruth Rendell. For the first time in as long as I could remember, my sole source of entertainment for an evening was going to be a book. And yes, yes, just as you’d expect, it was wonderful, it was cozy, the internet is terrible. But what struck me more than the night’s general delightfulness, was how much my experience of reading the book was influenced by the speed with which I was suddenly moving through it. To that point, I’d been reading the book the way I usually read books, which is to say in five- or 10-minute snatches before bed. And I’d been more or less enjoying it — watching Rendell’s criminal protagonist get out of prison, following along as he searched for his victim — but I’d been enjoying it the way a person enjoys hors d’oeuvres at a cocktail party. Those cheese puffs are delicious; I just wish I could sit down with a plate of them. Now, by reading for an hour or two straight, I’d found my way into the caterer’s tent. I could savor the particular tart flavor of the author’s voice. I could admire the elegance of the trap she was setting for her doomed criminal. Before my storm-induced Rendell marathon, I’d been reading the wrong way. John Gardner, the literary critic, wrote that the job of the novelist is to create a “vivid and continuous dream” for the reader, but I’d somehow developed a case of readerly sleep apnea. I’d gotten into the habit of consuming novels so fitfully that I was all but sealed off from their pleasures. It was as if I’d been watching movies in a special buffering-only mode, or listening to music through the world’s balkiest Bluetooth headphones. This style of reading had, I realized, shunted me into a vicious circle. I was reading less because I was enjoying it less, which made reading even less enjoyable, which inclined me to read even less. In this way, a bookmark lodged at page 128 of “Wolf Hall” began to seem as immovable as a Stonehenge tablet. I had accidentally discovered one of the great disadvantages of books (a medium that is not exactly short on disadvantages at the moment). There is no team of brilliant and vaguely sinister engineers, cooking up ways to get you binge reading. There is no auto-play technology frictionlessly delivering you from one chapter of the novel you’re reading to the next. There is only you, alone in the silence of your room with a chapter break before you and your phone cooing at you from the dresser. No one could blame you for putting “The Count of Monte Cristo” back on the bedside table where it spends its days. Maybe, like a long-forgotten glass of water, it will evaporate of its own accord. But in book after book, if you do push on through one chapter break, and then on through the chapter break after that, something amazing happens. Subplots that would once have been murky to the point of incomprehensibility (what was the deal with that dead sea captain again?) step into the light. Little jokes and echoes, separated by dozens or even hundreds of pages, come rustling out of the text forest. A writer’s voice — Grace Paley at her slangy best, Nicholson Baker at his hypomanic craziest — starts to seep into and color the voice of your innermost thoughts. You will, in other words, find yourself propelled through a book that would once have been a multiseason dead weight in your tote bag. And this will not be the creepy propulsion of the countdown that draws you guiltily into a “White Collar” marathon, but the intimate, happy propulsion that keeps you talking well into the night with a visiting friend. Now this may all seem a bit rich, coming from a fiction writer. You aren’t enjoying reading? Then read longer! Read faster! The problem is you! But the corollary to this way of reading — of taking books down in gulps rather than sips — is that you will discover much more quickly when a book isn’t for you, and you can then set it aside without the nagging suspicion that you might have sabotaged it by your method of ingestion. Fine, you say. If I were Thoreau, with nothing more on my agenda than a pond walk at noon and an apple at 3, it might be nice to read like this. But who has the time? To which I say: Let’s talk again about all those hours of “White Collar."" Because the mind — for all its endless rationalizations and solemn prohibitions — is in fact a ceaseless pleasure hound. Once I’m actually enjoying a book, it really does feel as if the pages are turning themselves; I find myself reading in all the little pockets of time that were once reserved for the serious business of checking to see if my dishwasher pods have shipped. And pleasure is, after all — once I scrape away the layers of self-image and pretentiousness — the reason that I read. When I’ve found the right book, and I’m reading it the right way, reading is fun — head-tingling, goosebump-raising fun. It’s a vivid and continuous dream that is somehow both directed from without and cast from within, and I get to be awake for it. Netflix can wait.

2019,Why You Should Try to Be a Little More Scarce,"Conventional wisdom tells us we should eagerly embrace every opportunity that comes our way, but playing a little hard to get has its advantages. Back in college, I was always the first to raise my hand in class (a behavior that didn’t win me many friends, let me tell you). Now as a freelance writer, I’m no stranger to that same overeagerness when it comes to work — translated in prompt replies and more than the occasional emoji. Emails, tweets, Slack messages — you name it — being affable and amenable is kind of my thing. And while conventional wisdom tells us we should eagerly embrace every opportunity that comes our way, playing a little hard to get has its advantages. Study after study has shown that opportunities are seen to be more valuable as they become less available, meaning that people want more of what they can’t have, according to Robert Cialdini, a leading expert on influence and the author of “Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade.” “What the scarcity principle says is that people are more attracted to those options or opportunities that are rare, unique or dwindling in availability,” Dr. Cialdini said. The reason behind this idea has to do with the psychology of “reactance”: Essentially, when we think something is limited to us, we tend to want it more. Luckily for us, according to experts, it’s possible to harness this concept and increase our appeal in things like negotiations and career advancement. So if you find yourself becoming overzealous over every little opportunity that comes your way, here are a few ways to keep things in balance: Appearing readily available can work against you, according to Jeremy Nicholson, a social psychologist who focuses on decision-making, social influence and relationship dynamics. This comes down to economics — if you’re in low supply and high demand, you’re worth more. Think about it this way: If you’re overly excited about a work opportunity, that might communicate that you are in low demand. All the more reason to play it cool. Making something harder to get, Dr. Nicholson said, “tends to increase at least the perception of the value, if not its actual value.” Part of making this work means keeping your enthusiasm in check. “Overeagerness can be a sign of naïveté or sound like plain desperation,” said John Lees, a Britain-based career strategist and the author of “How to Get a Job You Love.” When it comes to things like compensation negotiations, be clear that you are really interested in finding out more about the opportunity, Mr. Lees suggests, but give a sense that you are aware of your skills and your market value. If you find yourself approached by hiring managers or potential clients, Dr. Nicholson recommends responding in a way that respects their interest without coming across as too eager. In other words, “You’re selective with who you work with, but you would consider working with or for them.” [Want even more great advice? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.] Be confident and assertive, Dr. Nicholson advises, with responses like: “Well, I do have a couple of other projects that I’m working on. However, I could prioritize this for you if you want.” By being selectively interested, you’re not being so hard to get that you insult the person who is seeking a relationship with you, he said, but rather letting them know that you have options. “Plus, you’re prioritizing them because they’re valuable to you as well.” And if you are still nervous about appearing overzealous, give yourself time to recalibrate before answering an email or hopping on the phone. Better yet: Get physical. Taking a moment to go on a walk has been shown to lower stress and boost your well-being. This allows your brain to quiet a little, said Liz Ryan, founder of Human Workplace and the author of “Reinvention Roadmap: Break the Rules to Get the Job You Want and Career You Deserve.” The point here is to decrease your anxiety so you can focus on the negotiation at hand. It’s easy to become excited when an unexpected opportunity presents itself, Ms. Ryan said, but remember that your power in any negotiation is related to your ability to walk away. Once you have interest, channel that into due diligence, Mr. Lees said. “Research the organization as if you were going to invest half your life savings in it,” he said. It’s also important to continually check in with your gut, Ms. Ryan added, and remember: Don’t accept an offer before fully considering the terms. Playing hard to get can feel scary because you may really need the money, “but no one will value you more highly than you value yourself,” she said. Sometimes it’s a matter of giving yourself the space to calm down and evaluate. Ms. Ryan recommends asking a lot of questions, reading up on the organization from third-party perspectives, and checking out job-search websites like glassdoor.com to see what employees and ex-employees say about it. Keep in mind: The goal is to approach any negotiation cautiously and with a clear head. Not only should we do our homework in the moment, Dr. Cialdini said, we should also be continually assessing our market worth, “so that if an unexpected opportunity comes up, you don’t have to rush and do a slack job on this crucial factor.” Keep an updated spreadsheet on hand with a list of your skills and achievements so you can quickly review it when you have an offer. You also have to know how much to charge for your services beforehand. Ms. Ryan suggests using tools like salary.com, paysa.com and payscale.com to figure out what others like you get paid in your ZIP code. The idea is to plan ahead so you’re not scrambling in the moment. Having a firm understanding of how much your skills are worth will allow you to not rush after every opportunity that arises (and yes, this includes hasty email responses). Recognizing that there are unlimited possibilities can give you the security and confidence you need to create successful outcomes. “A lot of people that make decisions based on fear are people that are playing small versus thinking big,” said Caroline Castrillon, a business coach and the founder of Corporate Escape Artist. Negative thoughts can become self-fulfilling prophecies if you say them to yourself enough, she added. Try reappraising negative self-talk by noticing when it leads to thoughts of failure. Do you imagine losing out on future opportunities if you don’t eagerly accept the ones that are in front of you? As a freelance writer, I’ve often fallen into the trap of taking on too many assignments for fear that saying “no” would limit my options later on. But according to Dr. Nicholson, we need to reframe how we use scarcity and abundance in our own head before we can apply it outwardly. When you worry about all the things you’re going to lose out on if you don’t take a particular opportunity, you’re using the scarcity mind-set on yourself rather than as a persuasion strategy, he said. “You’re at a real disadvantage mentally.” Most people tend to tell prospective employers or clients “all the wonderful things they can and are going to do for them,” Dr. Nicholson said, adding, “That’s an abundance mind-set for them,” whereas your own inner dialogue might be full of insecurity. “So it’s about flipping it around,” he said, “and coming at it from the perspective of abundance from inside of one’s self.” Ultimately, appearing less available isn’t about limiting our enthusiasm or being unnecessarily hard on ourselves. It’s about trusting in our own self-worth so we can be proactive, experts say. This means mindfully aligning our excitement into strategy. “Emphasizing the uniqueness of your resources and your collaborative approach can help you more quickly advance your goals,” said Shirli Kopelman, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan and the author of “Negotiating Genuinely: Being Yourself in Business,” who views emotions as a resource in negotiation. Part of training ourselves to think differently, Ms. Castrillon said, is regularly stepping outside our comfort zone (and holding off on sending all those overeager replies). Pushing yourself beyond what you think you can do is a good way to train yourself to see possibilities, she added. “It’s basically a mind-set that if this doesn’t work out,” she said, “there’s something even better right around the corner.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the business school at the University of Michigan. It is the University of Michigan Ross School of Business, not Michigan Ross University.",The New York Times
2019,Why a Hamptons Highway Is a Battleground Over Native American Rights,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. — For the legion of rich and famous in New York, the unofficial start of summer means migrating east by luxury vehicle to the Hamptons, that slice of exclusivity at the end of Long Island. But this Memorial Day weekend they were greeted with a jarring new sight along an otherwise piney, bucolic stretch of Sunrise Highway, the main artery leading to the Hamptons: two six-story illuminated billboards being hastily constructed by a local Native American tribe just in time for the high season. Tall enough to rise above much of the tree line of this state roadway, the twin billboards — with bright electronic display panels operating around the clock — are about as far from the standards of the Hamptons as could be imagined. The billboards are being put up by the Shinnecock Indian Nation, a tribe that for many centuries before this area was settled by Europeans in the 1600s occupied wide expanses of what is now some of the priciest real estate in the world and a summertime playground for the 1 percent. Besides the 1,550-member tribe’s modest reservation nearby, the small parcel spanning the highway at the billboards’ site is nearly the only land the Shinnecock still retain. The tribe is partnering with an outdoor advertising company to run local ads on the billboards, as well as national campaigns for high-end brands like Rolex, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Its members are determined to use the revenue as an economic engine to revitalize the tribe. But the billboards have infuriated much of the Hamptons, where such signs violate government regulations. Stop-work orders have been issued by state and town officials who call them eyesores and distractions to drivers. The tribe had defied a cease-and-desist order from the state Department of Transportation, as well as a stop-work order from the agency delivered by state troopers to the work site, said Bryan Polite, the tribe’s chairman. But on Friday, after state officials initiated legal action against the tribe to halt construction, a state Supreme Court judge issued a temporary restraining order against further work. Still, the sign on the eastbound side of the highway was already completed and remained in operation through the weekend. The signs are “clearly out of character” with the town’s low-rise, low-key style, said Jay Schneiderman, Southampton’s town supervisor. The signs “violate the spirit of our local ordinances meant to protect the rural character of the town” and keep the area an attractive escape for New Yorkers, he said. “The summer crowd comes here to escape the metropolis, only to find this urban element at the gateway to the Hamptons,” he said. But the Shinnecock insist that their sovereign status exempts them from any government rules. For weeks, they ignored government orders and continued to rush the signs up as officials scrambled to see if they could stop them. Tribal leaders say they will meet Tuesday to decide how to respond to Friday’s court order so they can finish erecting the other sign at the site. “We don’t recognize their authority on our sovereign lands,” Mr. Polite said. The ads are targeted at the wealthy summer crowd driving past, often very slowly, in the notoriously congested Hamptons traffic. Tribal members have been standing sentry at the construction site on the grassy shoulder of the highway, creating the possibility of a showdown if the authorities try to halt construction. A message on the signs welcomes drivers not to the Hamptons, but rather to the Shinnecock Nation, whose base is a 980-acre reservation nearby, just outside Southampton, a chic village filled with luxury boutiques and upscale dining spots. The Shinnecocks say that as an indigenous people they have aboriginal title to the parcel, which allows them to build what they want, armed simply with a building permit issued by the tribe’s council of trustees. The roadway is operated by the state, but since it is subject to federal highway regulations and runs through the Town of Southampton, numerous agencies have tried to sort out the jurisdictional questions. Enforcement could involve confronting the tribe and risking an ugly standoff along a stretch where many influential visitors drive past; the Hamptons has no shortage of influence, especially this year with presidential candidates flying in for the kind of campaign fund-raisers that are a staple of any election cycle. One regular is Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, to whom the Department of Transportation answers. Tribal members have been parking along the highway and gathering in lawn chairs, keeping an eye out for state troopers. Last week, several “No Trespassing” signs bearing the Shinnecock seal were posted at the site, and the tribe had several lawyers on rotation at the scene. Mr. Schneiderman said the billboards were more appropriate for Times Square and were safety hazards that would distract drivers, cause rubbernecking and further exacerbate the already maddening traffic. He and roughly 30 local elected officials recently signed a letter urging the tribe to find an economic project other than the signs. Whatever the legality, Mr. Schneiderman said, “I’ve been trying to appeal to their conscience as good neighbors to voluntarily change direction and develop other economic engines.” The tribe long believed its economic problems would be solved by opening a casino, especially after it gained federal recognition in 2010. But that effort has stalled amid internal rifts and legal problems. Tribal officials would not disclose the financial arrangements of the billboard deal, but said that members would hardly get rich from the revenue, which would help fund social programs, maintain the reservation and create a tribal police force. “This is not about driving Maseratis,” Mr. Polite said. “It’s about providing resources to the nation and creating programs so people can work.” About half the families on the reservation live below the federal poverty level. The signs, which the tribe calls “monuments,” are topped with the Shinnecock’s official seal to make a territorial statement. “It’s a marker of who we are, and to show people that this is our land,” Mr. Polite said. “Yes, there are advertisements on them. But for many of our people who feel like they’ve been forgotten, seeing our tribal seal 60 feet in the air, it’s like we’re visible now,” he said. When one of the signs was recently completed, members became “very emotional,” Mr. Polite said. “Some of our elders were crying and there was a big sense of pride and euphoria,” he said. “They felt like our ancestors were smiling down on us for these monuments.” Mr. Schneiderman acknowledged the town’s troubled history with the tribe. “I know the Shinnecocks have been mistreated in the past — their land was stolen, their people were killed and the living conditions on the reservation for many are at poverty level,” he said. “I want to see the Shinnecock Nation thrive and I want to help them.” Regarding the signs’ appropriateness, tribal members pointed out that the town’s zoning has failed to stop plenty of outsize mansions. Lance Gumbs, the tribe’s vice chairman, pointed toward a nearby cellphone tower as an example of the town permitting other tall structures. And new condos were allowed at a location near the Shinnecock Canal, which the tribe had long considered a sacred place because it was a site where their forebears landed tribal canoes. “They routinely desecrate our sacred land,” he said, “and they’re complaining about a sign on a highway?”",The New York Times

But the Shinnecock insist that their sovereign status exempts them from any government rules. For weeks, they ignored government orders and continued to rush the signs up as officials scrambled to see if they could stop them. Tribal leaders say they will meet Tuesday to decide how to respond to Friday’s court order so they can finish erecting the other sign at the site. “We don’t recognize their authority on our sovereign lands,” Mr. Polite said. The ads are targeted at the wealthy summer crowd driving past, often very slowly, in the notoriously congested Hamptons traffic. Tribal members have been standing sentry at the construction site on the grassy shoulder of the highway, creating the possibility of a showdown if the authorities try to halt construction. A message on the signs welcomes drivers not to the Hamptons, but rather to the Shinnecock Nation, whose base is a 980-acre reservation nearby, just outside Southampton, a chic village filled with luxury boutiques and upscale dining spots. The Shinnecocks say that as an indigenous people they have aboriginal title to the parcel, which allows them to build what they want, armed simply with a building permit issued by the tribe’s council of trustees. The roadway is operated by the state, but since it is subject to federal highway regulations and runs through the Town of Southampton, numerous agencies have tried to sort out the jurisdictional questions. Enforcement could involve confronting the tribe and risking an ugly standoff along a stretch where many influential visitors drive past; the Hamptons has no shortage of influence, especially this year with presidential candidates flying in for the kind of campaign fund-raisers that are a staple of any election cycle. One regular is Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, to whom the Department of Transportation answers. Tribal members have been parking along the highway and gathering in lawn chairs, keeping an eye out for state troopers. Last week, several “No Trespassing” signs bearing the Shinnecock seal were posted at the site, and the tribe had several lawyers on rotation at the scene. Mr. Schneiderman said the billboards were more appropriate for Times Square and were safety hazards that would distract drivers, cause rubbernecking and further exacerbate the already maddening traffic. He and roughly 30 local elected officials recently signed a letter urging the tribe to find an economic project other than the signs. Whatever the legality, Mr. Schneiderman said, “I’ve been trying to appeal to their conscience as good neighbors to voluntarily change direction and develop other economic engines.” The tribe long believed its economic problems would be solved by opening a casino, especially after it gained federal recognition in 2010. But that effort has stalled amid internal rifts and legal problems. Tribal officials would not disclose the financial arrangements of the billboard deal, but said that members would hardly get rich from the revenue, which would help fund social programs, maintain the reservation and create a tribal police force. “This is not about driving Maseratis,” Mr. Polite said. “It’s about providing resources to the nation and creating programs so people can work.” About half the families on the reservation live below the federal poverty level. The signs, which the tribe calls “monuments,” are topped with the Shinnecock’s official seal to make a territorial statement. “It’s a marker of who we are, and to show people that this is our land,” Mr. Polite said. “Yes, there are advertisements on them. But for many of our people who feel like they’ve been forgotten, seeing our tribal seal 60 feet in the air, it’s like we’re visible now,” he said. When one of the signs was recently completed, members became “very emotional,” Mr. Polite said. “Some of our elders were crying and there was a big sense of pride and euphoria,” he said. “They felt like our ancestors were smiling down on us for these monuments.” Mr. Schneiderman acknowledged the town’s troubled history with the tribe. “I know the Shinnecocks have been mistreated in the past — their land was stolen, their people were killed and the living conditions on the reservation for many are at poverty level,” he said. “I want to see the Shinnecock Nation thrive and I want to help them.” Regarding the signs’ appropriateness, tribal members pointed out that the town’s zoning has failed to stop plenty of outsize mansions. Lance Gumbs, the tribe’s vice chairman, pointed toward a nearby cellphone tower as an example of the town permitting other tall structures. And new condos were allowed at a location near the Shinnecock Canal, which the tribe had long considered a sacred place because it was a site where their forebears landed tribal canoes. “They routinely desecrate our sacred land,” he said, “and they’re complaining about a sign on a highway?”",The New York Times
2019,Why a Tax the U.S. Hasn’t Embraced Has Found Favor in Much of the World,"Economic View You may not like paying taxes, but your burden will be even higher if others don’t pay their fair share. That, in a nutshell, goes a long way toward explaining why a value-added tax, or VAT, is used by just about every major country in the world except the United States. Although the concept has never caught on in this country, the VAT has been a powerful, well-mannered weapon for progress. That is especially true in less-affluent nations, because it reduces tax evasion in a relatively effective and gentle way, as an emerging body of research shows. Rich countries collect 34 percent of gross domestic product in taxes on average (the United States collects about 27 percent). But most low- and middle-income countries — a range of places, from Mali to Malaysia — collect much less, typically just 10 to 20 percent of G.D.P. The main reason is that it is harder to collect taxes in less-advanced nations, where a larger share of economic activity is informal, making tax evasion easier. Yet tax revenue, which enables governments to provide public goods like roads and schools, is at least as important in poorer countries. Enter the VAT, which taxes personal income indirectly by collecting it from businesses. A value-added tax also has a built-in, self-enforcing feature. Here is how it works. At its most basic, a VAT taxes the value a business adds to a good or service as it is being produced. The added value may be thought of as the price at which the business sells its product minus the cost of producing it. For example, a wholesale bakery earns revenue by selling bread to grocery stores. Subtract from that the bakery’s spending on flour, yeast and other ingredients. The difference is the added value on which the bakery is taxed. In addition, the flour company would pay a VAT on the revenue from its flour minus what it pays for wheat and the like. When you tally the value added at every stop on the supply chain, from wheat farmer to bread eater, you get the retail price of the bread. Thus a VAT is a tax on consumption and it can be easier to administer than a personal income tax. For one thing, the government collects the VAT from businesses (of which there are relatively few) rather than households (of which there are many). For another, especially in less-advanced economies, personal income tax systems are rife with problems because so many people are self-employed, with latitude to fudge their reported income. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service estimates, self-employment and farm income are underreported by over 60 percent. Even so, the personal income tax system in the United States works pretty well because most people have an employer. That’s not the case in many other countries. A VAT resembles a sales tax, with an important difference: It is paid at every stage of production, not just the point of sale. That makes a VAT marvelously self-enforcing, because one firm’s tax deductions are another firm’s tax liability. When the baker buys flour, it is in her financial interest to inform the tax authority about the purchase, so that she can deduct the cost from her tax base. That information alerts the tax authority about the flour producer’s income. These theoretical advantages are well known, but Dina Pomeranz, an economist at the University of Zurich, found a way to test how important they are in practice. In a study published in the American Economic Review in 2015, she collaborated with the tax authority in Chile, using the prospect of audits to uncover where fraud was rampant. The Chilean tax authority sent letters to a randomly selected set of firms, all of which were required to pay a VAT, informing them that they were under special scrutiny. Professor Pomeranz found that after the letters were received, the reporting of business-to-business sales hardly budged, suggesting that income was already being reported accurately. In contrast, businesses like grocery stores that sold to consumers started reporting more income and paying more VAT. Why was there a difference? With a VAT, there is a last-mile problem: A store customer buying bread had no incentive to ask for a receipt, because she couldn’t deduct the cost from her income as businesses could, so many business-to-consumer transactions were underreported. Governments have tried to solve the last-mile problem by adding a reward for customers who ask for a receipt. The state of São Paulo, Brazil, started a program in 2007 that gave customers a rebate of roughly 1 percent on their retail receipts. (To make the program more enticing, some of the rebate is in the form of raffle tickets for prizes worth up to $500,000.) Retailers had to submit the receipts to the tax authority, and consumers in São Paulo could check online whether stores had submitted their receipts and complain to the tax authority if they hadn’t. In essence, shoppers were enlisted as citizen tax auditors. The Brazilian program succeeded in increasing tax collection among retailers 21 percent, according to a research study by Joana Naritomi at the London School of Economics that analyzed the program’s first four years and is scheduled to appear in the American Economic Review. The success of VAT systems in emerging economies is welcome news for the beneficiaries of that tax revenue. It might be useful one day in the United States, too, and for another reason. Because a VAT taxes consumption, rather than income, it tends to encourage saving and investment. It has its problems, too. A big one is that it is regressive. If you have barely enough money to get by, you can’t afford to save: Your entire income is spent on essentials and, thus, taxed. Richer people are taxed on a much smaller share of their income. But a VAT can be paired with progressive tax policies, like a tax credit for low-income people, that counterbalance this deficiency, as argued by William Gale of the Brookings Institution in his book “Fiscal Therapy.” In the end, a VAT’s major advantage is that it can bring in a great deal of revenue with comparatively little administrative cost and without as much need for intrusive enforcement. It could be an appealing option for the United States one day.",The New York Times
2019,Why a Witness to Eric Garner’s Death Is Giving Up on ‘Justice’,"About New York The only public hearing into what happened to Mr. Garner — who exclaimed “I can’t breathe” as he died from a police chokehold — takes a microscopic view of a galvanizing event, our columnist writes. Over the last two weeks, a Staten Island man named James received an unexpected FedEx delivery. Then a certified letter. His phone rang constantly with calls from people on the 13th floor of Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan. A taxi was parked outside his home, waiting for him. James did not open the FedEx, the mail or the taxi door. No matter the entreaties, James said, he was not going to testify at the disciplinary trial of Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is accused of recklessly using a chokehold that led to the death of Eric Garner. One of the most important witnesses to Mr. Garner’s death, James, who had twice given his account under oath in earlier proceedings, said this latest one trivialized the killing of a man. In fear of police retaliation, he said, he does not want his last name published. “I’m done,” he said. The unanswered calls, the unopened letters, might well stand for the dwindling urgency of coming to grips with a police encounter and a death that not long ago had galvanized the country. Mr. Garner’s final moments, calling out “I can’t breathe” 11 times, were captured on videotape nearly five years ago and helped propel the Black Lives Matter movement. Mr. Garner, who was being arrested on suspicion of selling loosies, or single untaxed cigarettes, had objected to being handcuffed. What seemed to be a landmark case, a moment of reckoning for how the police treat people in poor and minority neighborhoods, appears to be petering out with an administrative hearing that carries neither criminal penalties nor the burden of understanding how a man who posed no obvious physical threat to anyone could end up dead over the sale of cigarettes. Still, some clues to what happened in July 2014 have emerged at the hearing. In addition to Mr. Garner’s unforgettable words anticipating his death, another statement was made that day, and it became public for the first time on Thursday. Moments after learning that Mr. Garner had no pulse and was likely to die, a police lieutenant sent a text message, writing, “Not a big deal. We were effecting a lawful arrest.” The lieutenant’s union representative said he was not being callous about the death, but was trying to reassure subordinate officers who were upset. They were doing the jobs that their department and society wanted. That assurance by the police commander on July 17, 2014, has, so far, turned out to be as prophetic as Mr. Garner’s last words that same afternoon. The disciplinary hearing is the first public airing, and could be the last, of the circumstances of Mr. Garner’s death beyond the viral video. While the police trial is weighing whether the actions of Officer Pantaleo and a sergeant violated departmental rules and warrant punishment, the issues are so narrowly tailored that none of the other dynamics that drove the fatal encounter — such as leadership, expectations placed on officers, police culture, race and community complaints — are under serious consideration. The disciplinary hearing will not include testimony from James, believed to be one of the last people to speak with Mr. Garner other than the police. He has already testified in two secret grand jury proceedings, he said, and was exasperated that nothing had come of what appeared to him to be a misuse of power that anyone could see on the video. When he was first approached about appearing at the disciplinary trial, James said he asked the investigators what consequences it might hold for the officer. “They said, ‘He can lose vacation time or he can lose his job,’” James said. “Get out of here. Lose vacation time? Give me a break. He killed someone.” James spends most of his days on the streets around Tompkinsville Park on Staten Island, the same neighborhood where Mr. Garner died, making him vulnerable, he believes, to harassment by the police. “I’m a brother. I walk a thin line,” he said. “I try to stay on the right side.” The hearing has revealed that a police supervisor recommended in 2015 that internal charges be filed over Mr. Garner’s death, but the department’s own disciplinary unit did not pursue them. The current proceeding was initiated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which operates independently of the Police Department. So the judge’s findings are not binding on the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill. If the video of Mr. Garner’s death seemed unequivocal in meaning to many viewers, a halting uncertainty within law enforcement over the proper response to it has extended from the City of New York to the top of the United States Department of Justice, from the Obama to the Trump administrations. Last year, civil rights prosecutors in Washington asked permission to seek indictments for use of excessive force, but they were opposed by other federal prosecutors, including a contingent from the Brooklyn office. The dispute was presented for resolution to Rod J. Rosenstein, who was deputy attorney general at the time, but no decision has been announced. The statute of limitations on any federal crimes expires in July, the fifth anniversary of the police encounter with Mr. Garner. James, 58, said he spoke at length with F.B.I. agents about the events, and then before a federal grand jury in Brooklyn. “I was down,” he said. “For a while. Down for whatever it takes. I wanted to get justice.” He also testified in front of a state grand jury on Staten Island that declined to indict any police officers in Mr. Garner’s death. Mr. Garner, who was well over six feet tall, weighed 395 pounds and suffered from asthma and hypertension. Officer Pantaleo’s lawyers said it was Mr. Garner’s poor health that led to his death after he refused to comply with a lawful order. In fact, he died from an asthma attack, a city medical examiner testified at last week’s hearing — the last in a chain of medical calamities that the examiner said had been set in motion by a chokehold, Autopsy photographs show hemorrhaging to four layers of muscle and tissue in Mr. Garner’s neck. These injuries, the medical examiner said, had been caused by the chokehold and compression, and led to the fatal siege of asthma. Although chokeholds are not against the law, the police are forbidden by policy from using them in almost all circumstances. Even so, they continued to be occasionally employed by officers, and departmental punishment is rare and light, a review of records by The New York Times found. Officer Pantaleo’s lawyers argued that he did not put Mr. Garner into a chokehold, and had instead used a technique called a “seatbelt” hold, a view they claim was buttressed by a doctor employed by the police department who said that there were no injuries to Mr. Garner’s trachea. Not so, replied the disciplinary prosecutors; the police doctor, they say, did not review the actual autopsy. And that doctor was contradicted by a police supervisor and other internal affairs officers who testified that the video showed Officer Pantaleo using the chokehold. The streets where Mr. Garner died are, today, an often raucous bazaar, featuring a regular parade of drug users who stroll past high school students waiting for Victory Boulevard buses, clients of a social services office and customers of fast-food restaurants, a laundromat, a coffee shop run by a commune and check-cashing services. Some younger people in the neighborhood did not know about the death of Mr. Garner. But Joseph Evans, 48, who said he was “10 feet away” from Mr. Garner as he died, believes the police have dialed back enforcement tactics. “Someone is holding the reins in, because they did slow down,” said Mr. Evans, who is homeless and spends his days around Tompkinsville Park. “There’s people selling loosies and making a fortune, and no one is sweating them.” Moments later, that lighter police touch described by Mr. Evans was on display just a few feet away, at the corner of Victory Boulevard and Bay Street. A fight broke out — complete with slaps, punches and profanities bellowed above the din of wheezing buses — between a woman and a man she had accused of stealing her phone. Within minutes, four police vehicles arrived and eight officers emerged. They separated the combatants, leading one safely off the block. No arrests were made. No force was used. “This is the worst corner on Staten Island to have a fight,” the woman who lost her phone said. “The police are all over here.” After that ruckus, James, who was standing nearby, picked up a discussion about the recent hearing. For him, three words of the lieutenant’s text message nail the stakes of the disciplinary trial: no big deal. “All he was going to lose is vacation time?” James said, repeating one possible outcome of the hearing. “I don’t give a hoot.” Reporting was contributed by Gareth Smit, Ali Winston and Ashley Southall",The New York Times
2019,Why an Alice Neel Painting Is Stuck in This Artist’s Psyche,"The painter Jordan Casteel discusses her favorite artwork and the affinity she feels for its creator. When the painter Jordan Casteel first saw a copy of “Alice Neel: Painted Truths,” a book on the 20th-century painter Alice Neel, she was struck by the artist’s “freshness and sense of imperfection.” “I found myself totally in awe that there was somebody who had made work in a way that I was trying to make work myself,” she says. “Her work emulates and speaks and lusts out with a sense of humanity that I really admired, and was drawn to.” As Casteel, 30, has come into her own artistic practice as a painter of people, she has explored urban life and the informal networks that sustain black communal bonds. Her subjects include Harlem street vendors, families, and young black men and boys (painted both nude and clothed) — all a mix of family from Denver and friends from New Haven, where she earned an M.F.A. in painting and printmaking at Yale. Her sitters, both male and female, are often seen in vulnerable yet comfortable poses and places; their skin is realized in blues and purples, reds and browns. In the portraits, Casteel captures her subjects with a warm respect, humanizing them with her black female gaze — and challenging dominant presumptions of them in our society. [Coming soon: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] In painting the people that populate her universe — as in “Elijah” (2013), “Miles and Jojo” (2015) and “The Baayfalls” (2017) — she did not know that her own life as a painter would come to mirror that of her early inspiration. Like Neel before her, Casteel moved to Harlem, in 2015, when she became an artist in residence at the Studio Museum, following a stint in Brooklyn after she graduated. More than a half-century after Neel captured the vivid and honest expressions of the celebrated writers and artists she knew in Spanish Harlem, as well as families and friends, Casteel found herself in a studio provided by the museum that overlooked bustling 125th Street, scouting potential subjects. She would run down and take snapshots with a camera of whoever caught her eye, and later paint them from the photographs. It’s a key part of Casteel’s process that differs from Neel’s preferred studio sessions, in which subjects often sat across multiple days. Casteel’s new “Subway” series, which depicts unsuspecting New Yorkers during their commute, offers a kind of modern archive of faces and spaces of the city and a visual biography of a gentrifying Harlem. In painting from inside her community with this kind of deep intimacy, Casteel exists in a long and distinguished lineage of black portraitists who reconsider and widen notions of realism by employing abstraction, including painters such as Barkley L. Hendricks, Henry Taylor, Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald and her contemporary Jennifer Packer. “I’m thinking about blackness and being people of color and in its full rainbow glory,” she explains. “Literally allowing the diversity that exists within us to exist on the canvas itself, as I choose the colors to represent the figures. There is that fearlessness that was within Neel that I identified that I tried to then bring back in the painting.” Watch the video above to see Casteel talk about her favorite artwork — Neel’s 1976 portrait of Faith Ringgold — and the artist’s enduring influence on Casteel’s art practice. “Jordan Casteel: Returning the Gaze,” Casteel’s first museum solo exhibition, is on view from May 26 through August 18, 2019, at the Denver Art Museum, 100 W. 14th Ave Pkwy, Denver, Col., denverartmuseum.org. An earlier version of this article misidentified the museum where Jordan Casteel currently has a solo exhibition; it is the Denver Art Museum, not the Denver Museum of Art.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why the Fight Over Abortion Is Unrelenting,"The abortion-rights debate raises questions about women’s rights that remain unresolved 46 years after Roe v. Wade. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington on politics, demographics and inequality. In her classic 1984 study, “Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood,” the sociologist Kristin Luker addressed the fundamental question posed by the medical termination of a pregnancy: Why is the debate so bitter, so emotional? Part of the answer is very simple: the two sides share almost no common premises and very little common language. Luker elaborated further: Those who oppose abortion usually begin by stipulating that since the embryo is an unborn child, abortion is morally equivalent to murder. But for those who accept abortion, this initial stipulation is exactly what is problematic; from their point of view, the embryo has the capacity to become a child but it is not a child yet, and therefore belongs to a very different moral category. Over the years, the abortion debate has become a linchpin in the political battle between Democrats and Republicans, mobilizing Christian evangelicals on the right and supporters of the women’s movement on the left. Why has the abortion issue had such staying power, compared, for example, with the steady liberalization of views on homosexuality and interracial marriage? Part of the reason for this is that the abortion issue taps into competing, deep-rooted views on the role of men and women in society. The sexual revolution and the radical transformation of the work and personal lives of women after the introduction of the contraceptive pill in the early 1960s — and the guarantee of women’s reproductive rights by the Supreme Court decisions Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965 and Roe v. Wade in 1973 — brought these antithetical beliefs about abortion to the fore. President Trump’s appointment of two conservative justices to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, opened the anti-abortion floodgates this year. Republican legislatures in eight states — Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Georgia, Arkansas, Kentucky and Utah — have enacted stringent anti-abortion legislation, gambling that the five-member conservative bloc on the court will weaken or overturn Roe — or, if that strategy fails, that anti-abortion supporters will be galvanized for the 2020 election. [Sign up for In Her Words, a twice-weekly newsletter on women, gender and society.] Over the 46 years since Roe was decided, the constituencies on both sides of this issue have changed radically, and the debate has become increasingly complex and increasingly politicized. In the last decade, support for unrestricted abortion rights has grown from 21 percent to 29 percent, while the percentage backing a complete ban has fallen from 21 percent to 18 percent, according to Gallup. From 1975 to 1988, the views of Democrats and Republicans on abortion were virtually identical, again according to Gallup, when 18 percent to 21 percent of voters in both parties agreed that abortions should be allowed “under any circumstances.” Since 1988, the parties have diverged: by 2018, 46 percent of Democrats, but only 11 percent of Republicans, said abortion should be “available under any circumstances.” Contemporary polling shows that there are a number of contradictions in the public view of abortion. In some respects, majority opinion is supportive of abortion rights, in others it is opposed. For example, on the abortion rights side, last year Gallup found that a clear majority — 64-28 — opposed overturning Roe v Wade. By 60-34, the public believed abortion should be legal during the first three months of pregnancy. In further support of abortion rights, overwhelming majorities in 2018 supported abortion during the first trimester if the mother’s life was endangered (83-15); when the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest (77-21); and by slightly smaller majorities when “the child would be born mentally disabled” (56-41) or “with a life-threatening illness” (67-31). On the anti-abortion side, Gallup found that majorities opposed abortion in the second trimester (65-28) and by a larger margin in the third trimester (81-13). The public continued to support abortion in the third trimester when the life of the mother was in danger (72-22), but was much more lukewarm toward third-trimester abortions when the pregnancy resulted from incest or rape, supporting the procedure 52-42. In addition, in 2018, the public opposed third-trimester abortions when the child would be born with a mental disability (61-35) and split (48-49) on third-trimester abortions if the child would be born with a life-threatening illness. The states in the process of restricting abortion are either seeking to prohibit it after a set number of weeks, ranging from six to 20 depending on the state; or to prohibit abortion after a heartbeat can be detected (roughly six weeks); or, in the case of Alabama, to ban all abortions except those to save the life of the mother. The abortion debate is a key element in the larger division of opinion in America about the sexual revolution, pitting those who believe that sexual autonomy is crucial to the achievement of gender equality against those who, in the words of the Southern Baptist Convention, honor the rich and valuable contributions of full-time wives and mothers who through their service and self-sacrifice have strengthened their families, enriched our nation and pleased our God by honoring his purposes in their lives each day. Leaders of the anti-abortion movement are explicit in placing blame on the sexual revolution for what they see as the larger corruption of the social order, the demand for women’s autonomy and for abortion. “The abortion license has helped to erode the moral foundations of the American civic community,” wrote 39 prominent opponents of abortion in a famous 1996 declaration, “The America We Seek: A Statement of Pro-Life Principle and Concern.” How do its opponents believe abortion has undermined the American moral character? According to the statement, The abortion license is inextricably bound up with the mores of the sexual revolution. Promotion of the pro-life cause also requires us to support and work with those who are seeking to re-establish the moral linkage between sexual expression and marriage, and between marriage and procreation. We believe that a renewal of American democracy as a virtuous society requires us to honor and promote an ethic of self-command and mutual responsibility, and to resist the siren song of the false ethic of unbridled self-expression. Liberal proponents of women’s rights have, in turn, countered this idea with a set of arguments about the real stakes in the argument over abortion. As Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York formulated it recently: Abortion bans aren’t just about controlling women’s bodies. They’re about controlling women’s sexuality. Owning women. From limiting birth control to banning comprehensive sex ed, U.S. religious fundamentalists are working hard to outlaw sex that falls outside their theology. Robert Kurzban, a co-author of “The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind,” argued in an email that abortion opponents want to “impose a cost on those having sex without wanting to reproduce.” The underlying rationale for this, Kurzban contended, is that people who are in long-term committed relationships are threatened by extramarital relationships and they in fact want to impose this cost on others. On the opposite side, according to Kurzban, are those who want to control their reproduction carefully while still having sex, who stand to benefit from the availability of abortion and related services. They want to avoid this cost; abortion restrictions make their lifestyle more difficult. Kurzban’s argument is based on the premise that “morality” — judgments about which acts are wrong and which are not — is best understood strategically, a means by which one can try to prevent others from doing things that are (often in aggregate) bad for oneself. Put another way, “ideology is just the narrative used to sell the strategy that is in one’s interests.” Sarah B. Hrdy, professor emerita of anthropology at the University of California, Davis, and the author of “Mother Nature: Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human Species,” wrote in reply to my inquiry that the issues touched on in the abortion debate run deep: Nature provides myriad examples of species where males attempt to control who females mate with and when. Among primates, male coercion of females has evolved many times and is expressed in many different ways. Over the course of human history, Hrdy continued, some of these ancient impulses have become enshrined in patriarchal ideologies. This helps explain why the most extreme efforts to curtail female reproductive autonomy today are primarily funded by groups linked to Catholic, Orthodox Jewish, Islamic and other belief systems with deep patriarchal roots. If, as Hrdy argues, anti-abortion legislation is part of the male “attempt to control who females mate with and when,” why are roughly equal numbers of men and women opposed to abortion? Her answer: From Ancient Greece, Ching dynasty China, Victorian England to the American South, the trick has been to convince women that conforming to patriarchal ideals, being chaste, or modest, veiling one’s face, whatever, are in her interests in terms of her security, marriageability, and especially in the interest of her children, particularly sons. When the social status of their families and especially that of their offspring, depends on their “virtue,” women have an obvious stake in complying as well as in advertising their compliance. Supporting the “right” political candidates can be just one more way of doing that. According to many of the scholars whose views I solicited, the sexual revolution and the simultaneous entry of women into the work force have prompted two conflicting reactions. Martie Haselton, a professor of psychology at U.C.L.A., and David Pinsof, a graduate student there, together argue that “the debate boils down to attitudes about promiscuity.” Picking up the same theme as Kurzban, Haselton and Pinsof found in their research that the people who are most likely to oppose abortion are those that 1) believe that abortion promotes promiscuity, and 2) pursue a more restrictive mating strategy. These results show that self-interest, when construed in evolutionary psychological terms, plays a powerful role in predicting people’s attitudes toward abortion. In the case of “sexually conservative individuals,” they write, laws that would seem to permit or endorse promiscuity are a fundamental threat. For example, one could invest decades of effort in reproducing within a committed family structure to have it undermined by a single promiscuous interloper: Men could be deceived into investing in another man’s offspring; women could be abandoned with multiple children and limited resources. David Buss, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas, argues that “attitudes toward abortion are linked to a key issue: sexual morality.” One constituency, which Buss described in an email as “politically conservative and high on religiosity,” adamantly “abhors short-term mating, casual sex, promiscuity, etc.” For this group, “moral condemnation of promiscuity in others has a long and deep history.” These particular conservatives, in Buss’s view, see abortion and other ruptures with traditional sexual morality as a threat to their own commitment to a lifelong faithful marriage. According to Buss, they recognize that men become less willing to commit to one woman to the degree that there exist women in the mating pool who are willing to engage in casual sex with them. So allowing women to have abortions may be viewed by women and men alike as tantamount to endorsing a promiscuous mating strategy. In his response to my inquiry, Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, focused primarily on why men would be particularly concerned about any practice that would increase the sexual autonomy of women: Restricting abortion is an example of men’s restrictions on women’s reproductive capacity, which has taken many forms in various cultures and historical periods: chaperones, veils, wigs, burqas, niqabs, chadors, segregation by sex, confinement, foot-binding, genital mutilation, chastity belts, restrictions on birth control, double standards for adultery, violent sexual jealousy and laws and customs that make a woman the property of her husband. The evolutionary explanation, Pinker wrote, “is straightforward. Humans are unusual among mammals in that men invest in their children, feeding, protecting and teaching them.” As a result, a father who invests in his children will have more successful children, which favors any genes that tilt a man toward investing in his children. But of course that only works if they are his children. Evolutionarily speaking, cuckoldry is the worst thing that can happen to a man, because his investment would be wasted in protecting another man’s genes. Men, in Pinker’s analysis, seek to control the sexuality, and more generally, the reproductive capacity, of their wives and girlfriends (and for that matter their unmarried daughters, preserving their value in the arranged marriage market). Contraception and abortion, even though they are modern inventions, may press these emotional buttons. Pinker stressed that these calculations are not conscious: the actual thoughts and emotions running through people’s brains are not about babies, cuckoldry, genes, investment or any of the concepts that enter into the ultimate, long-term, evolutionary explanation of people’s motives. The men who are pressing to make abortion illegal, some of whom would ban contraception as well, are not only, as Pinker says, unaware of the evolutionary forces motivating them, they appear to be in many respects ignorant of the havoc they would create if they are successful in their efforts. In a sign of the hypocrisy that surrounds this issue, this would be an inconvenience to many Southern Baptist preachers and church volunteers, 380 of whom have been “accused of sexual abuse and misconduct over the past 20 years,” according to investigations by The Houston Chronicle and The San Antonio Express-News. Conservatives argue that abortion and contraception have undermined family, paternal responsibility and long-term commitment and that Abortion on demand has given an excuse to men who shirk their responsibilities, claiming that the child they helped to conceive ought to have been aborted, or that the woman who declined to abort may not impose on him any responsibility for her “lifestyle choice.” In some respects, the conservative analysis has some truth to it. In a 2009 paper “Social Change: The Sexual Revolution,” Jeremy Greenwood and Nezih Guner, economists at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Barcelona, described “the rocket-like rise in premarital sex that occurred over the last century.” Greenwood and Guner attribute this to the dramatic decline in the expected cost of premarital sex, due to technological improvement in contraceptives and their increased availability. George Akerlof, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and Janet Yellen, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, who are married, write interestingly on this same subject in “An Analysis of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States.” “This paper,” the authors write, relates the erosion of the custom of shotgun marriage to the legalization of abortion and the increased availability of contraception to unmarried women in the United States. The decline in shotgun marriage accounts for a significant fraction of the increase in out-of-wedlock first births. The anti-abortion conservatives proclaim that their goal, as enunciated in the “Statement of Pro-Life Principle” I mentioned above, is an America that is open, hospitable and caring, a community of civic friendship in which neighbors reach out to assist neighbors in distress. A problem with conservative thinking on this issue is that once the sexual and women’s rights revolutions were unleashed, there was no way women (or men, for that matter) were going to peacefully relinquish the sexual and other freedoms they had gained. Abortion and contraception also perform a crucial safety-net function, preventing the “rocket-like” increase in sexual activity from producing even more unwanted children. If the social conservative agenda were to win out, the most likely outcome would be a surge in unwanted children — along with the costs those children bear — according to David A. Grimes, a former chief of the abortion surveillance branch at the Centers for Disease Control. The Turnaway Study at the University of California, San Francisco, confirms the likelihood of this outcome: The numbers of hard-pressed single mothers would grow, and there would be a revival of the illegal abortion industry. In effect, conservatives are trying to ban the reproductive practices that were crucial in enabling the sexual and women’s rights revolutions. What they would achieve instead is a world where these revolutions continued to dominate, but without the tools to limit the costs in unwed motherhood, absent fathers and the spread of female poverty.

2019,Why the Golden State Killer May Keep California’s Death Penalty Alive,"LOS ANGELES — In Courtroom 106 in downtown Los Angeles, a jury has begun hearing testimony in the long-awaited trial of a man accused of stabbing to death two women in their homes at night. The killer stalked his victims, ingratiating himself as a repairman, and then killed them in a spasm of violence. One victim was nearly decapitated; another’s breasts were slashed off. One of the women, a former girlfriend of the actor Ashton Kutcher, was found in a pool of blood on the stairs. The gruesomeness of the killings and the celebrity connection have earned the suspect the tabloid-style moniker of The Hollywood Ripper. Prosecutors are asking jurors to deliver a death sentence. Nearly 400 miles to the north, in Sacramento, prosecutors have come together to seek a death sentence for Joseph James DeAngelo, the man accused of being the so-called Golden State Killer, who terrorized communities up and down the state in the 1970s and ’80s before an arrest was made last year with the help of a genealogy website. And several other capital cases are underway in California, including the trial of a man accused of killing an officer in Sacramento and a suspect described as a serial killer in Los Angeles County. A prosecutor may also seek a death sentence for the man charged in the recent synagogue shooting near San Diego. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, issued a moratorium in March on executions in the state, which has more death row inmates than anywhere else in the Western Hemisphere. But that decision has not stopped local prosecutors from seeking new death sentences, underscoring the divide in the state between conservative prosecutors and liberal reformers like the governor. And as liberal as California voters are generally, as recently as 2016 they rejected a ballot measure that would have abolished capital punishment, and approved another one to fast-track executions. These divisions, experts say, are setting the backdrop for what could be a contentious fight as Mr. Newsom takes new steps beyond the moratorium to abolish capital punishment. For now, the moratorium amounts to temporary reprieves for each of the 737 men and women on California’s death row, which will last for the duration of his time as governor. “It’s got to be really confusing for the average citizen who sees both things going on and doesn’t understand how all of the above can be occurring,” said Michele Hanisee, the president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys in Los Angeles County. She is seeking a death sentence in one of her cases: the man accused of being a serial killer, Alexander Hernandez, who is charged with killing five people in a shooting rampage in the San Fernando Valley in 2014. “The simple answer is this: The district attorneys of the state of California took an oath to uphold and follow the law,” Ms. Hanisee said. “I think the governor probably did too, but he doesn’t care.” The governor, she added, does “not have the legal authority to tell them not to seek death or not to follow the law.” New death sentences in California have declined in recent years; 2018 was a record low, with five new sentences. The drop aligns with a national trend, as public support for capital punishment has waned and juries have been reluctant to impose death sentences in the face of evidence of racial disparities and high-profile exonerations. Before Mr. Newsom’s moratorium, 20 other states, including most recently Washington and Delaware, had abolished the practice. Public support for capital punishment across the country has dropped substantially since the 1990s, according to polling data from Gallup. California, while maintaining a large death row, has not executed anyone since 2006. There were longstanding legal challenges to the state’s lethal injection protocol that had halted executions even before Mr. Newsom’s moratorium. Many supporters of capital punishment say that while the system can be reformed to reduce racial disparities, and thus produce fewer death sentences, the penalty should remain an option for prosecutors and juries in the most heinous of crimes, including some of the cases underway in California. “The case for the death penalty is the moral part of it,” said Kent Scheidegger, the legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, an organization in Sacramento that favors the death penalty and supported a ballot initiative in 2016 in which voters approved fast-tracking executions. “For the very worst murderers, nothing short of execution is adequate.” Research that shows racial disparities in the capital punishment system — that black and Latino men are disproportionately sent to death row — has led to an acknowledgment that the system is flawed, and is at the heart of calls for abolition. But in California, supporters of the death penalty argue that white men are charged with committing some of the most egregious crimes, including Michael Gargiulo, the Hollywood Ripper suspect, or Mr. DeAngelo, who was once a police officer. “Gargiulo is a white dude,” Ms. Hanisee said. “Golden State Killer, he’s a white guy who was a cop.” She also noted that many of the 24 death row inmates who have exhausted all of their appeals — and would be next in line for executions if they were proceeding — were white men. “Of the 24 or so who are presently eligible for execution, half of them are white men,” she said. “So let’s execute them.” In an interview, Mr. Newsom said that his administration was considering several new steps to dismantle the state’s capital punishment system and that his moratorium was a first step on what he hoped was a path that ended with abolition. He said his advisers were studying how he could commute the sentences of current death row inmates to life without parole. Mr. Newsom has the power to commute sentences in which the inmate has only one felony, but more than half of the death row population has at least two felonies; to commute those sentences would require approval from the State Supreme Court. Mr. Newsom’s advisers are focusing on the Supreme Court’s decision to block several pardons or commutations — though not for death row inmates — issued by Gov. Jerry Brown before he left office in January. Those rejections were the first time in decades the court had blocked a governor’s commutations, and Mr. Newsom has asked the court for an explanation. He hopes the explanation will offer some guidance “that will allow us to form better judgment on next steps if we want to look to commutations on the capital punishment side.” “Life without the possibility of parole. We are not releasing anybody. We are by no means pursuing that,” Mr. Newsom said. Mr. Newsom also said he was discussing with the attorney general’s office what role the state could play in blocking prosecutions of new death sentences. But legal experts say this power is limited: The state could decline to defend capital cases on appeal, but it does not have the power to order district attorneys, who are elected at the county level, to not seek death. “He does not have the authority to tell prosecutors or even the attorney general what the policy is going to be with respect to individual prosecutions,” said Shilpi Agarwal, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union in San Francisco. “As long as the death penalty is on the books, they are free to seek it in any individual prosecution.” One possibility is that the attorney general could take cases away from local prosecutors. But experts say that is unlikely and would be unprecedented. “I have not seen any indication from our attorney general that they want to impose the governor’s view and take cases away from us so that we cannot seek capital punishment,” said Anne Marie Schubert, the Sacramento County district attorney, who is part of the prosecution in the Golden State Killer case. Ms. Schubert added that “capital punishment is the law in California, and just because Gavin Newsom has a personal opposition to it doesn’t mean that we as prosecutors abandon our obligation to enforce the law in the appropriate cases. I’m not this zealot about the death penalty, but it is the law.” Those who oppose capital punishment, like Mr. Newsom and Ms. Agarwal, say that no matter how gruesome a particular case is, it does not justify perpetrating a system they see as biased, with the possibility of wrongful convictions. Almost immediately, Mr. Newsom’s moratorium had an impact nationally, with candidates running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020 coming out against capital punishment. “When you are putting a moratorium on the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere, it’s going to have an impact, we believe, on the national debate,” Mr. Newsom said. “This was not just about California. It’s not just about the situational nature of prosecutions in this state. It’s about a deeper question about our values and who we are.” All of this appears to be heading to a new ballot initiative in California, perhaps as soon as 2020, about whether or not to keep capital punishment. “The deeper question is, when is this ripe for reconsideration at the ballot?” Mr. Newsom said. If there were to be another fight at the ballot over capital punishment, Californians would most likely hear a lot about the Golden State Killer and other terrible crimes. “We will talk about the facts of these cases and what these people did,” Ms. Hanisee said. “And if the California voters vote to get rid of the death penalty, so be it. But it needs to be an honest debate.”",The New York Times
2019,Why the New York Public Library Has 7 Floors of Stacks With No Books,"In Midtown Manhattan, space is prized. But stacks at the library’s main branch are empty because officials say the space cannot protect irreplaceable books from the elements and theft. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] When the New York Public Library opened on Fifth Avenue in 1911, thousands of people lined up outside the palatial Beaux-Arts building to get their hands on books they could find nowhere else. There were rare first editions of classics like “The Scarlet Letter,” political treatises and hand-scribbled family histories, all stored within easy reach in seven football-field-size floors of stacks just below the main reading room. But over the next century, the stacks became outdated and could not adequately protect irreplaceable books from sunlight, heat and humidity, library officials said. The books were taken away in 2013 as part of the library’s plan to replace the stacks with a new lending library, which drew howls from prominent authors, scholars and many patrons. The plan was abandoned, but the stacks remained empty as library officials figured out what to do. The answer, library officials say after a two-year study, is that the stacks at the heart of the building will have no books — at least not anytime soon. The work to modernize them would be too expensive (costing as much as $200 million) and disruptive. So the cavernous space will remain in limbo as officials move to expand storage space outside the library for one of the world’s leading research collections. Still, library officials emphasized they would not tear out the stacks. In the meantime, there are plenty of books for patrons to peruse. But the decision disappointed some library watchers who had long awaited news of the stacks. Charles D. Warren, an architect and historian, pointed to other prominent research libraries, including the Library of Congress, that had renovated their stacks. “The purpose of a library is to have the books close at hand,” he said. Joan Scott, a historian at the Institute for Advanced Study, said the stacks were designed to hold books, and “it doesn’t make sense for them not to be used for books and special collections.” The stacks, fashioned out of steel from the industrialist Andrew Carnegie, were part of the original design of the building. From the beginning, they served a dual purpose: Stacked one on top of another, they held up the grand, chandelier-lit reading room. The stacks themselves were off limits to library patrons. Instead, books were requested by filling out a slip of paper that was whisked down a pneumatic tube to workers in the stacks below. The books were sent up in mini-lifts resembling dumbwaiters. Later, the stacks were modernized with fire sprinklers and air-conditioners that struggled to cool down the space. But library officials said little could be done about the towering windows that overlooked Bryant Park and allowed in sunlight and moisture, or the 26 entrances to the stacks that posed a security risk. As the library’s research collection grew, officials built a windowless storage space with air-filtration and climate-control systems under Bryant Park. They also helped build a modern research center in New Jersey in 2000; it is shared with Princeton, Columbia and Harvard universities. In 2012, library officials unveiled a $300 million plan they said was essential to the future as they grappled with financial pressures and an emerging digital landscape. It included moving up to half the 2.5 million books in the stacks to New Jersey to make room for a new circulating library. Critics railed against the plan, saying it cost too much, would undermine the research library and could lead to delays in getting books. It was scrapped in 2014. David Nasaw, a history professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center who opposed the plan, said ideally he would like to see books back in the stacks. “How could you not want them right there as they used to be?” he said. But even more important, he added, was that the books remain safe and available to researchers — even if that required them to be kept somewhere else. Today, the research collection consists of about 11 million books and more than 40 million documents, photos and research materials divided among four dedicated research libraries, of which the Fifth Avenue building is the largest. The collection includes the first printed collection of Shakespeare’s plays, a copy of the Declaration of Independence in Thomas Jefferson’s hand and a letter from Christopher Columbus to King Ferdinand. But it is also a record of everyday life. It is where every issue of Vogue can be found along with every phone book from around the country. There are collectible comic books, 18th-century newspapers and underground literature from the Soviet Union. About 300,000 books — mainly the most valuable and fragile — remain inside the Fifth Avenue building in special collection rooms. The books from the stacks have been divided between the two outside storage spaces. Popular and more recent books are under the park; more shelves were added in 2015. Less requested books have been sent to New Jersey and are trucked in within 24 hours after a request (some researchers complain it can take longer). William Kelly, the director of the research libraries, said that even if the stacks were retrofitted for books, they would not provide as much protection as these modern, state-of-the-art storage systems, which the library plans to expand. “The heart of the New York Public Library has always been its collections,” he said. “Our priority is being good stewards of those collections so researchers can access them now and in the future.” Some library users said that if the stacks could not be used for books, they should be repurposed for something else. Meaghan Ritchey, 33, a marketing director, said she would like the see the space opened to the public for library exhibitions, readings and workshops. “This is Midtown Manhattan,” she said. “It shouldn’t sit there empty.” William Freedman, 55, a finance and technology writer, suggested filling the stacks with computers and data storage. “It’s really using them for their intended purpose,” he said. “The information that was stored in books in the 20th century is stored digitally in the 21st century.”",The New York Times
2019,Why the Rich Don’t Get Audited,"news analysis The I.R.S. doesn’t have the resources it needs to chase offshore accounts and tax cheats. Mr. Eisinger and Mr. Kiel are reporters at ProPublica. The hot policy in Democratic circles these days is raising taxes on the rich. Senator Elizabeth Warren has a plan to tax “ultramillionaires,” as she calls them. Senator Bernie Sanders wants to expand the estate tax. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has floated raising the top income tax rate to 70 percent for those making over $10 million a year. But before this country raises taxes, it should grapple with something much more prosaic but equally important for tackling inequality: saving the Internal Revenue Service. Already, wealthy people and corporations easily get around today’s rules. However tough any new laws might seem, they’d soon be undercut. Slowly and quietly over the past eight years, the I.R.S. has been eviscerated. It’s lost tens of thousands of employees. It has fewer auditors now than at any time since 1953. In real dollars, the agency’s budget has dropped by almost $3 billion since 2010. Businesses and the wealthy benefit the most from this state of affairs. The largest corporations in America used to be audited every year. That started to change when the cuts began, and today, the audit rate has fallen by half. It’s a similar story for individuals making $10 million or more a year: With twice the chance of escaping I.R.S. scrutiny, the ultrarich are much less likely to lose at the game of audit roulette. Fixing the problem will require more than increasing the I.R.S.’s budget (though that would certainly help). It’s about having the right personnel with the right skills. Today, the wealthy and corporations have the I.R.S. outgunned. The ultra-affluent — with the help of legions of tax professionals — make domestic income disappear overseas or hide it in a pyramid of partnerships. It’s like trying to take on a modern army while armed with spears and clubs. The I.R.S. has difficulty tracing the income of the superwealthy or countering their sophisticated arguments about why what appears to be one type of income is actually something else. The agency also has trouble valuing their assets (a problem that, as The Times revealed, dates back at least to when Fred Trump was misleading the I.R.S. about how much his buildings were worth). By the public admission of numerous I.R.S. officials, it has long done a poor job of scrutinizing complicated partnerships to understand who owns what portion of what stock. The top 0.5 percent of highest-earning Americans account for about a fifth of the income that’s hidden from the I.R.S., according to a University of Michigan study, or more than $50 billion a year in today’s dollars. It’s much easier to enforce the tax laws for the bottom 90 percent of earners. Wages are reported straight to the I.R.S., and computers can easily check that tax returns accurately report that income. This means that inadequate enforcement of the tax laws necessarily has a regressive effect, liberating those at the top from scrutiny while the masses continue to be tracked by machines. With its budget slashed, the I.R.S. has pulled back across the board — except for one area where it’s been easier to keep the numbers from falling so much: audits of the poor. More than one-third of all audit targets claim the earned-income tax credit, one of the nation’s largest anti-poverty programs. By the hundreds of thousands, I.R.S. computers spit out letters that require low-income taxpayers to prove their eligibility. The counties with the highest audit rates aren’t found in the hedge fund precincts of Connecticut or the lobbyist enclaves of Northern Virginia. No, they’re rural, mostly African-American counties in the Deep South. There’s nothing easy about auditing the rich. Even when the I.R.S. has evidence of flat-out cheating, such as when it discovers a hidden Swiss bank account, it can take years of work to prove its case. Taking that kind of time clashes with one of the core ways the I.R.S. evaluates its managers and agents: how efficiently they open and close audits. As one senior manager put it to us, “If you’re not churning out the exams, you have to explain why you’re not.” But more often, the affairs of the superwealthy are infernally complicated and the I.R.S. doesn’t have black-and-white proof of evasion. Instead, the agency runs up against what’s called “aggressive” planning in the tax world. To the rich, tax returns are just opening offers to the government. If they don’t get audited, that’s great. If they do, well, they’re ready for a fight. In 2009, the I.R.S. decided to take a bold, new approach to auditing the superwealthy. The agency’s idea was to bring specialists together and form a kind of green-eyeshade-wearing Delta Force. It would finally do something it — surprisingly — hadn’t been doing before: look at the entirety of a taxpayer’s empire. That meant examining how his partnerships, limited liability companies, foundations, gifts and overseas operations interact with one another. The ultrarich weave all of these together so that they end up with an ultralow effective tax rate. “We hadn’t really been looking at it all together, and shame on us,” Steven Miller, a former acting commissioner of the I.R.S., told us. Because of budget cuts and lobbying, this elite force never came together. The agency hoped to have a staff of about 240 expert auditors by 2012. But by 2014 it had only 96, and by last year the number had fallen to 58. Initially spooked by the group’s ambition, tax professionals who counsel the wealthy now speak of the effort with a kind of pity. Criminal tax enforcement has also faltered. More than 150 million income tax returns were filed in 2017, but the I.R.S. brought fewer than 800 cases in which someone was charged with making legal income but criminally evading taxes. That’s one reason tax cheats can get away with brazen behavior for so long — until they attract the attention of federal investigators for other reasons. That’s what happened to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion, and the celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, who was charged with failing to file taxes at all for several years. (Mr. Avenatti denies the charges.) So, what to do? One 2020 candidate already has a bold proposal to resuscitate the I.R.S. It’s a plan to pump tens of billions into the agency, enough to fund a second army of agents. That candidate’s name is Donald Trump. Of course, it was Mr. Trump’s party that gutted the agency, costing the country, we estimate, more than $100 billion in lost revenue. The president’s 2020 budget, however, did propose adding $15 billion over 10 years to the I.R.S. enforcement budget, a move that would be a significant increase to the agency’s budget. The administration estimated this would produce revenue of at least $47 billion. The question arises: Has the administration genuinely had a change of heart? Or is this merely a neat trick to make deficit projections appear smaller? So far, this is all just talk. It is, though, one of the few areas where Mr. Trump and Democrats are in substantive agreement. Democrats in the House recently proposed a $400 million I.R.S. budget increase next year. Among the Democratic presidential candidates, Ms. Warren does mention the I.R.S. in her wealth tax proposal. She calls for an unspecified but “significant increase in the I.R.S. enforcement budget” and a minimum audit rate for taxpayers subject to her “ultramillionaire” tax. Raising taxes on the rich is a more compelling cause than increasing the operating budget of a bureaucracy most American voters probably hate thinking about. But the boldest tax plan of all starts with salvaging the I.R.S. Jesse Eisinger and Paul Kiel are reporters at ProPublica, an independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization.

2019,Why the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Long and Painful: No Offramps,"There’s a shrinking supply of the ‘constructive ambiguity’ that would let each side present a deal as a win. Just two weeks ago, the United States and China seemed to be gliding toward a trade deal meant to resolve tensions between the world’s two largest economies. But the breakdown in talks since — the United States raised tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese imports, for example, and is threatening to tax an additional $300 billion — worries people who study international economic diplomacy. That’s because both the United States and China seem to be digging into their positions in ways that will be hard to resolve with the mutual face-saving that typically turns high-stakes negotiations into deals. To use a common negotiating metaphor, it is not clear what the offramps might be that would allow a de-escalation and prevent a major trade war that would prove costly to both nations. In effect, President Trump appears to view continuing tension with China as good for him politically and has said, contrary to the view of mainstream economists, that tariffs are a reason for the United States’ recent economic good fortune. China’s leaders may not reveal their thinking in real time on Twitter, but they have signaled that many of the concessions the United States wants would require China to sacrifice core parts of its economic strategy and national sovereignty — in particular its ambitions to lead in the high-tech industries of the future. “Each side has dug itself into some fairly deep holes such that it will be difficult to emerge from,” said Douglas Rediker, chairman of International Capital Strategies and a former U.S. representative to the International Monetary Fund. As is often the case in negotiations, the pathway to a deal may rest in a “constructive ambiguity” that both sides can present to their domestic audiences as a win. “Do I believe there’s enough room to find common ground?” Mr. Rediker said. “Yes, but only based on this ambiguity that doesn’t necessarily resolve the issues in one party’s favor or another.” Both sides have taken subtle steps to allow time for last-ditch efforts. China sent a senior negotiator to Washington last week despite the breakdown in talks, and it delayed the start of its retaliatory tariffs on American imports until June 1. The United States applied the newest wave of higher tariffs based on when ships containing the affected goods arrive, adding a few weeks in which a reversal could be hammered out. And President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could meet at the G20 summit in late June in Osaka, Japan, which would be an opportunity for de-escalation at the highest levels. But open lines of communication and time to work won’t by themselves solve the problem of how to finesse some mutually agreeable deal, particularly given that both countries view this negotiation as resetting their economic relationship in ways that would have long-lasting consequences. Add in Mr. Trump’s tendency to view every negotiation through a zero-sum prism, and it may be hard to find a pathway for both parties to go home able to proclaim victory. When the negotiations seemed to be going well a few weeks ago, “I thought we were going toward constructive ambiguity,” said Mary E. Lovely, an economist and trade expert at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School. The United States is demanding that China codify rules into law to protect American companies (and their technology) that do business in China. Chinese negotiators now reject that possibility; American officials said they had agreed to those provisions. “It looks like there was a level of specificity that China wasn’t willing to accept and a level of ambiguity that the Trump administration wasn’t willing to accept,” Ms. Lovely said. “It looks like the Chinese are firm that there are some areas where they are not willing to go, that they see as disrespectful.” If the escalation now being signaled by both sides goes into force, Americans will face higher prices for a wide range of goods, and certain American manufacturers will face less demand for their products. Already, American farmers are suffering amid reduced Chinese demand for soybeans and other products. The Chinese manufacturing sector is hurting as well — and is likely to suffer further if tariffs reduce American demand for their products or drive relocation of production to other countries. Ultimately the question becomes how much of that pain each side will be willing to endure, and whether the two nations’ leaders feel a sense of urgency to each help the other save face domestically. Things can change quickly. In a different sphere, for example, Mr. Trump went from threatening North Korea with nuclear annihilation to acting as if they were old friends practically overnight. But given where things stand, it may take that kind of surprising reset between two top leaders, built on personal relationships, rather than the slow grind of hammering out an agreement that is more typical of economic diplomacy. “The off-ramps are tricky here because the president believes this is good policy, and the Chinese are loath to cave on it,” said Jay Shambaugh, a professor of international economics at George Washington University and director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. “It’s not abundantly clear how you climb down without any damage.” The question for the weeks and months ahead is how much damage each side will tolerate before rethinking some of those basic assumptions and deciding that they don’t want to dig in quite so hard, after all.",The New York Times
2019,"Wife of Slain Wall Street Banker: My Son Did It, but He ‘Is Nuts’","The killing stunned New York with its scandalous details: a Princeton graduate accused of murdering his parent for cutting back his $1,000 weekly allowance.

The operator instructed a woman how to perform chest compressions on her husband, who was unconscious on the floor of their Manhattan apartment. But six minutes into the call, Shelley Gilbert revealed the uniquely heart-wrenching circumstances she found herself in on the afternoon of Jan. 4, 2015. “He has been shot,” Ms. Gilbert said, trying to keep her voice calm. When the operator asked her who had done it, she quickly added: “My son, who is nuts. But I had no idea he was this nuts. He shot him in the head.” Moments earlier she had greeted her son, Thomas Gilbert Jr., and had left him alone with his father, Thomas Gilbert Sr., a fixture on Wall Street who had founded a successful hedge fund. The killing stunned New York society four years ago with its scandalous details: an Ivy League-educated child of privilege accused of killing his father for cutting back his $1,000 weekly allowance. A jury heard the agonizing 911 call during the first day of testimony in Mr. Gilbert’s trial on second-degree murder charges. Mr. Gilbert, 34, bearded and visibly gaunt, kept his head low as the 11-minute call played for the jury in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Late in the afternoon, Justice Melissa Jackson reprimanded him for shouting “objection” several times, urging him to “refrain from these outbursts.” Mr. Gilbert’s lawyers had argued unsuccessfully that he was unfit to stand trial because of mental illness, but prosecutors on Tuesday worked to paint him as a vindictive child who had planned to kill his father for reducing his weekly allowance by hundreds of dollars. “Rather than being a compulsive act of a person deranged, the evidence will show that this was a planned and calculated act of a self-absorbed and vengeful son,” Craig Ortner, an assistant district attorney, told jurors. Mr. Ortner said Mr. Gilbert had showed up unannounced that afternoon, and had asked his mother to leave them alone to “talk about business.” She left, but quickly returned. She found her husband on his back, his left hand covering a gun on his chest. Prosecutors have argued that the scene was clumsily staged to look like a suicide. Ms. Gilbert testified on Tuesday that she had agreed, reluctantly, to cut her son’s allowance in an effort to force him to seek psychiatric help. “For years we wanted Tommy to go to a psychiatric hospital. We tried everything we could,” she said. “This wasn’t a disciplinary problem. This was a health problem — a severe one.” Thomas Gilbert Sr. was an energetic 70-year-old who still ran the successful hedge fund he founded in 2011, Wainscott Capital Partners Fund, when he was killed. He often played tennis at the River Club. He lived with his daughter and wife of 33 years in an apartment on Beekman Place in Turtle Bay. “Tom Gilbert’s financial success was self-made. He made his money by wisely investing in the stock market,” Mr. Ortner said. “At the age of 70, he still had a lot of living up to do.” Unlike his father, Mr. Gilbert, a graduate of Princeton University, had known few successes outside surfing and was not able to keep a steady job, prosecutors said. Mr. Ortner said the younger man grew dissatisfied with his father’s diminishing financial help, even as he enjoyed a lavish lifestyle that included a Chelsea apartment, fine dining and vacations in Europe and Hawaii. “He was able to do these things because his parents supported him,” he said. Mr. Gilbert received psychiatric treatment and took medicine for depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses, “like many other New Yorkers,” Mr. Ortner said. Still, he said, Mr. Gilbert “knew what he was doing.” Investigators determined that he had tried to order a gun via Facebook, but later drove to pick it up in Ohio after failed attempts to have it delivered to New York, prosecutors said. “The evidence will not support that he was legally insane,” Mr. Ortner said. “The defendant was fully aware of what he was doing. The evidence will show that he executed his father in cold blood.” But Mr. Gilbert’s lawyer, Arnold Levine, told the jury that Mr. Gilbert had a 10-year history of psychotic illnesses and had failed to find proper treatment despite visits to many doctors. He had been diagnosed with a long list of mental disorders including anxiety, paranoia, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. “He believed that people were trying to steal his soul,” Mr. Levine said. “Don’t be thrown off by motives manufactured. He was given serious medication for a decade. It renders him criminally not responsible.” Ms. Gilbert said she was at first encouraged by her son’s impromptu visit. “He came in and told me he wanted to talk to Dad about business, and so I was excited about that,” she testified. “That could be good for both of them.” But after leaving, she said, she decided to return and grew worried when she put her ear to the door and heard silence. “My husband was lying on the floor,” she said. “I remember calling his name and hoping he was just knocked out. And then I looked at him, and then I knew he was no longer with us.”",The New York Times
2019,Will China’s Uighur Detentions Spur U.S. Sanctions? Pompeo Won’t Say,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo avoided saying on Sunday whether the Trump administration would impose targeted sanctions on China over mass detentions of Muslims, in another sign of the administration’s paralysis on the issue. Mr. Pompeo was asked on CBS News’s “Face the Nation” about whether the administration might punish Chinese officials for the detention of hundreds of thousands to millions of ethnic minority Muslims in camps in Xinjiang, a vast region in northwest China. The New York Times reported on Saturday that after months of debate, American officials had shelved proposed targeted sanctions for fear of jeopardizing continuing trade talks, and are unwilling to raise the issue in the talks. When pressed on CBS on the matter, Mr. Pompeo said he had raised the issue of human rights “in multiple conversations” with Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, and other officials. But he did not answer a question about any potential move on sanctions. Mr. Pompeo has criticized the camps and said last week on Fox News that their use was “reminiscent of the 1930s.” But the State Department has been unsuccessful in pushing through proposed sanctions. Last fall, American officials drew up a policy to impose sanctions on specific Chinese officials and companies over the camps, with a legal basis in the Global Magnitsky Act, but the policy failed to get through an interagency review process. While the State Department and the White House National Security Council approved the action, the Treasury Department voiced concerns about the effect on trade talks, according to American officials. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has generally been a proponent of reinforcing strong business ties with China, the world’s second-largest economy. Trade negotiators for the two sides are meeting this week in Washington and could conclude the talks. On Sunday, President Trump threatened to ramp up tariffs, a move that appeared to be aimed at forcing China to agree quickly to a deal. In defending the administration’s approach to China, Mr. Pompeo said on Sunday that Mr. Trump had pushed back against China’s “enormous trade abuses” and was working to end intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer by Chinese companies and the government. However, as the trade talks continue, it has become clear that the end result probably will not address critical issues like China’s cybertheft, state subsidies and regulations on trade in data. Economists say the trade deficit, which Mr. Trump is focused on, is not nearly as important as those other issues. On the issue of China’s detention of Muslims, who are mostly Turkic-speaking ethnic Uighurs, Democratic and Republican members of Congress have expressed frustration at the lack of sanctions from the Trump administration. They have been pushing since last year for economic penalties on senior officials, including Chen Quanguo, a Politburo member who is party chief of Xinjiang. On Friday, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told The Times that “words alone are not enough.” The host of “Face the Nation,” Margaret Brennan, also pressed Mr. Pompeo on Sunday on why the State Department and the Pentagon had different estimates of the number of detainees and used different labels for the camps. Mr. Pompeo has said the detention centers are “re-education camps” that hold up to one million people. On Friday, Randall G. Schriver, an assistant secretary of defense, told reporters that he considered the centers to be “concentration camps” that held “at least a million but likely closer to three million citizens.” It was by far the largest estimate from any official on the number of detainees. Human rights groups have generally said the number is hundreds of thousands to more than one million. Despite the obvious difference in estimates, Mr. Pompeo said there was no gap between the State and Defense Departments on their assessments. “Don’t play ticky-tack,” he said. “There’s no discrepancy.”",The New York Times
2019,Will Congress Expand the Insider Trading Prohibition?,"White Collar Watch Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ A common complaint about insider trading law is that there is no statute that expressly sets forth the requirements to prove insider trading. That can make it difficult to determine whether a violation has occurred. The House Financial Services Committee is seeking to remedy that. It recently passed a bill that would — for the first time — set forth what is required to prove insider trading. One of the advantages of the current state of the law is its flexibility. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department can apply it to new situations as they arise rather than being tied down to a single definition of what constitutes a violation. The new legislation, the Insider Trading Prohibition Act, would continue to allow the government to take a broad approach and pursue the same wide range of cases that it does already. And it may even allow an expansion into new areas. The current insider trading prohibition requires the government to prove that a defendant breached a fiduciary duty, or other duty of trust and confidence, by using or tipping the information for personal profit. The S.E.C. and prosecutors have at times had to stretch to find a relationship close enough to show that a defendant breached a duty by trading on confidential information. For example, in a recent settlement, the S.E.C. accused a defendant of being a guest in the home of a longtime friend and surreptitiously viewing documents about an impending merger, which resulted in profits of more than $250,000. Is friendship enough of a relationship to prove a breach of a duty of trust and confidence? Under the new legislation, it would appear it would be. The bill would make it a violation to trade while in possession of material, nonpublic information “if such person knows, or recklessly disregards, that such information has been obtained wrongfully, or that such purchase or sale would constitute a wrongful use of such information.” That would make it easier to use circumstantial evidence to show that a defendant knew, or at least turned a blind eye, to the source of the information. The bill would also make it a violation for a person “wrongfully to communicate” confidential information if it was “reasonably foreseeable” that the recipient, known as a tippee, would trade on it. The legislation also would move insider trading law away from its focus on a duty to keep information confidential by more broadly describing what constituted “wrongful” trading or transmission of confidential information. There would be four ways to show that the information had been obtained wrongfully: by theft, bribery or espionage; by violation of any federal law protecting computer data; by conversion, misappropriation or unauthorized and deceptive taking of information; and by breach of a fiduciary duty or breach of “any other personal or other relationship of trust and confidence.” All that is quite broad, and would make it easier to prove a violation. By including a breach of a federal data privacy law or even just theft of information, insider trading law would cover hackers who obtained information before its release to the public. The S.E.C. recently filed a case against nine defendants for hacking into the agency’s computer system to obtain information before its release to the public, resulting in at least $4.1 million in profits. Hackers do not owe any duty of trust and confidence as the current law requires. Under the new legislation, their efforts to obtain confidential information by breaching computer security measures would be subject to the insider trading prohibition. The government also could pursue cases in which a person lawfully obtained information and then put it to personal use by trading on it profitably. In Morissette v. United States, the Supreme Court explained that “conversion may include misuse or abuse of property.” That means the government would have to show only that the defendant had used it for personal gain, not that there had been any abuse of a personal relationship by trading on it. Current law also requires that the government show that a benefit flowed from the tippee to the tipper. The legislation would eliminate that requirement, making it easier to prove a violation. The bill provides that it is not necessary for the government to show “whether any personal benefit was paid or promised by or to any person in the chain of communication, so long as the person trading while in possession of such information or making the communication, as the case may be, was aware, consciously avoided being aware or recklessly disregarded that such information was wrongfully obtained or communicated.” Thus, simply knowing that information was wrongfully obtained, or consciously disregarding that fact, would be enough to prove a violation regardless of any personal relationship with the source. The legislation provides two potential safe harbors for traders. It would allow the S.E.C. to “exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or transactions, from any or all of the provisions” of the law. Whether the agency would be willing to authorize insider trading by companies or management is questionable because it could be seen as favoring Wall Street and corporate executives over ordinary investors. The bill also allows individuals to engage in “automatic trading,” which means trades that occur under an established plan of sales or have been made through an “advance election.” These trades are currently permissible for executives who sell shares on a regular basis without regard to any current information about the company. If the legislation makes it through the House and then the Senate — an open question — it will significantly expand insider trading law in the United States. And it will make proving insider trading much easier for the S.E.C. and the Justice Department.",The New York Times

2019,Opinion | Will Trump Be the Sage One?,"Maureen Dowd Opinion Columnist WASHINGTON — Only one person can save us from the dangerous belligerent in the White House. And that person is Donald Trump. How screwed up is that? Will the president let himself be pushed into a parlous war by John Bolton, who once buoyed the phony case on W.M.D.s in Iraq? Or will Trump drag back his national security adviser and the other uber hawks from the precipice of their fondest, bloodiest desire — to attack Iran? Can Cadet Bone Spurs, as Illinois senator and Iraq war vet Tammy Duckworth called Trump, set Tom Cotton straight that winning a war with Iran would not merely entail “two strikes, the first strike and the last strike”? Holy cakewalk. Once, we counted on Trump’s advisers to pump the brakes on an out-of-control president. Now, we count on the president to pump the brakes on out-of-control advisers. “On one side, you have a president who doesn’t want war, who simply wants to do with Iran what he has done with North Korea, to twist the arm of the Iranians to bring them to a negotiation on his terms,” said Gérard Araud, the recently departed French ambassador. “He thinks they will suffer and at the end, they will grovel in front of his power.” But in a way, Araud said, the face-off with the Iranians is more “primitive and dangerous” because, besides Bolton, other factions in the Middle East are also “dreaming of going to war.” “Even if Trump doesn’t personally want war, we are now at the mercy of any incident, because we are at maximum tension on both sides,” said Araud, recalling Candidate Trump’s bellicose Twitter ultimatums in 2016 when Iran’s Revolutionary Guards held American sailors blindfolded at gunpoint for 15 hours. Given their sour feelings about W. shattering the Middle East and their anger at Trump shredding the Iran nuclear deal, Europeans are inclined to see the U.S. as trying to provoke Iran into war. This time, the Europeans will not be coming along — and who can blame them? I’m having an acid flashback to 2002, when an immature, insecure, ill-informed president was bamboozled by his war tutors. There is the same feeling of the hawks building a calculated campaign for a Middle East invasion. W.’s administration had a monthslong rollout strategy. “From a marketing point of view,” Andrew Card, W.’s chief of staff, said in the summer of 2002, “you don’t introduce new products in August.” Have the hawks around Trump been waiting to get through two rings of fire — the Mueller threat and Benjamin Netanyahu’s re-election — to roll out their latest ingenious product: World War III? In an echo of the hawks conspiring with Iraqi exiles to concoct a casus belli for Iraq, Bolton told members of an Iranian exile group in Paris in 2017 that the Trump administration should go for regime change in Tehran. “And that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!” Bolton cheerily told the exiles. When Bolton was the fifth column in the Bush 2 State Department — there to lurk around and report back on flower child Colin Powell — he complained that W.’s Axis of Evil (Iran, Iraq, North Korea) was too limited, adding three more of his own (Cuba, Libya, Syria). Then, last year, Bolton talked about “the Troika of Tyranny” (Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela). His flirtations with military intervention in Venezuela this month irritated Trump. The 70-year-old with the Yeti mustache is an insatiable interventionist with an abiding faith in unilateralism and pre-emptive war. (The cost of our attenuated post-9/11 wars is now calculated at $5.9 trillion.) W. and Trump are similar in some ways but also very different. As Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio notes: W. was interested in clarity. Trump wants chaos. W. wanted to trust his domineering advisers. Trump is always imagining betrayal. W. wanted to be a war hero, like his dad. Trump does not want to be trapped in an interminable war that will consume his presidency. Certainly, the biographer says, Trump enjoys playing up the scary aspects of brown people with foreign names and ominous titles, like “mullah” and “ayatollah,” to stoke his base. But Trump, unlike W., is driven by the drama of it. “It’s a game of revving up the excitement and making people afraid and then backing off on the fear in order to declare that he’s resolved the situation,” D’Antonio said. “Trump prefers threats and ultimatums to action because that allows him to look big and tough and get attention without doing something for which he will be held responsible. This is who he is at his core: an attention-seeking, action-averse propagandist who is terrified of accountability in the form of coffins arriving at Dover Air Force Base.” David Axelrod, who had the military briefing about what a war with Iran would look like when he was in the Obama White House, said: “I’m telling you. It’s not a pretty picture.” He says he is not sure which movie Bolton is starring in: “Dr. Strangelove” or “Wag the Dog.” “If part of your brand is that you’re not going to get the U.S. into unnecessary wars,” he said, “why in the world would you hire John Bolton?”",The New York Times
2019,Will Trump Speak at the Statue of Liberty? N.Y. Waits and Debates,"[Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Enjoy your day in a city where billionaires and the homeless can share the same block. Weather: Cloudy early, then May could bring showers (and fog). The high should reach the mid-50s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until May 27 (Memorial Day). After three years of construction, the new Statue of Liberty Museum will have a May 16 grand opening, and the invited guests include a bevy of Democratic elected officials. And President Trump. The mere possibility of his holding forth next to Lady Liberty has created a buzz in political circles and among immigration advocates. The president has not confirmed attendance, and neither have the other prominent invited elected officials, said Suzanne Mannion, a spokeswoman for the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, which built the museum and is managing the grand opening. [Everyone’s welcome at the Statue of Liberty. Except tour guides.] But with Mr. Trump on a guest list that includes the likes of Governor Cuomo, Gov. Philip Murphy of New Jersey, Senator Chuck Schumer, Representative Jerrold Nadler and Mayor de Blasio, it might make for one awkward ribbon-cutting. Some anti-Trump Democrats say the president should be excluded on the ground that his tough immigration stance mocks the statue’s welcoming spirit, epitomized by the famous lines on its bronze plaque from the Emma Lazarus poem: “Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” “President Trump’s anti-immigrant rants and policies are diametrically opposed to everything the Statue of Liberty stands for,” said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo. “His attendance would be truly ironic, and the mere symbolism of it should be offensive to all Americans whose ancestors were guided into this country by her torch.” But some Republicans called the setting ideal for Mr. Trump to hold forth on immigration. “The president should be welcome to come and deliver a speech at the statue, to highlight the benefits of legal immigration that built this country from its foundations,” said City Councilman Joseph Borelli, a Republican from Staten Island. “I suppose his base would enjoy him delivering an immigration speech while Governor Cuomo and Murphy sit silent.” A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Some politicos made sport of the whole thing. The president could speak near the statue “as long as they cover her eyes,” quipped Bob Liff, a Democratic political consultant, who added, “Are they going to redact sections of Emma Lazarus’s poem?” Bill O’Reilly — a Republican political consultant, not the former Fox commentator — said: “This could be the greatest episode of ‘Survivor’ ever — Chuck Schumer, Donald Trump and Jerry Nadler on an island together right in New York Harbor. Huge ratings.” Politics aside, the museum should be pretty nifty: a 26,000-square-foot space that will feature the original glowing torch, interactive galleries and an immersive theater.

Then came those classic rows of flip panels — their continuous clacking was part of commuters’ soundtrack — above the terminal’s elegant, stone-framed ticket windows, providing times, tracks and statuses for Metro-North Railroad trains. And even as the terminal’s main departure display — known as the big board — was modernized in recent decades with digital letters and numbers, it retained its old-school feel. Now the big board is getting a big revamping: Terminal officials are refitting the older electronic display, whose mechanisms had grown obsolete, with one that will be brighter and easier to read. The board’s housing will remain intact, and the new graphics will have a retro look to maintain the board’s historical integrity in the context of the 1913 terminal’s landmarked interior. The board’s new technology can better estimate train arrivals and communicate service changes during emergencies or other service disruptions, Metro-North officials said. The job, which is scheduled to be completed in June, is part of a larger $124 million effort to improve communications at the terminal and along Metro-North’s commuter lines, the officials said. The project also includes the installation of new public address systems and departure monitors at the smaller stations, they said. Dear Diary: On a recent trip from Florida to New York, my hometown, I spent an afternoon at the Museum of Natural History. I hadn’t been there in decades and I wanted to see the Northwest Coast Hall. I asked a tour guide standing near the hall to direct me. “Oh, I’m sorry,” she said. “That hall is closed for restoration.” When I mentioned that I hadn’t been to the museum in some time, she asked if I would like a get-reacquainted tour. It was just the two of us, and her broad range of knowledge and engaging personality impressed me. We visited the climate change exhibit, the Great Canoe, the blue whale, the fossil hall and Tyrannosaurus rex, and she provided personal anecdotes along with background information on each exhibit. That evening I attended Falstaff at the Met. As I settled into my seat before the performance began, I exchanged pleasantries with two women sitting to my right. “What have you been doing while you are here?” one of them asked. “I had a wonderful time at the Museum of Natural History earlier today,” I said. “Oh, really,” the woman exclaimed. “My friend and I are docents there.” “I had a wonderful guide there who gave me a personal tour,” I said. “She was terrific.” “Oh really? Who was it?” When I mentioned the name, both woman scoffed. “Oh, we don’t like her,” one said. “She just crams too much knowledge down your throat.” — Joseph P.

2019,Opinion | Will a Documentary Take Down the Polish Government?,"A film exposing sex abuse by Catholic priests also exposes the corrupting ties between the church and the ruling political party. Mr. Sierakowski is the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Warsaw and a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy. Following sexual-abuse scandals in the United States, Britain, Ireland and Australia, it seems that the Roman Catholic Church may be on the verge of a similar catastrophe in Poland. But whereas the blowback from previous scandals has been largely confined to the church itself, this latest crisis could take down the country’s right-wing government as well — and undermine the tight grip the church holds over Polish society. With just weeks to go before the European parliamentary elections — which in Poland will serve as a kind of opening act for its own parliamentary elections this fall — the country has been gripped by a shocking documentary exposing widespread child sexual abuse by Polish priests, and the subsequent cover up by the church. Released on YouTube, “Tell No One,” by the well-known journalist Tomasz Sekielski, was viewed 10 million times in the first two days. The priests involved include the personal chaplain of Lech Walesa, the Solidarity hero, who initially refused to believe the story, but ultimately condemned the cleric. The problem of pedophilia is well illustrated by the story of Father Pawel Kania, one of the subjects of the film. He was detained by church authorities in 2005 for attempting to seduce children and possessing child pornography. But instead of punishing him or turning him over to the authorities, the church relocated him to a parish in the city of Bydgoszcz — where he was, amazingly, tasked with working with children. In 2010, a court found Father Pawel guilty of possessing child pornography. Two years later, the priest was found in a hotel room with a boy and arrested. In 2015, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for rape and child molestation. Earlier this year, the church finally expelled him from the priesthood. The film quotes a letter from an altar boy in the Bydgoszcz parish where Father Pawel worked. The priest would take him on weekend trips, where he would rape him. “He would threaten me. ‘Don’t tell anyone, or I’ll tell your parents everything,’ ” the boy writes. “If you don’t come with me, I’ll take your brother.’” The author of the letter agreed to go on a trip to the Canary Islands to protect his younger brother from the pedophile priest. “I defended myself, I tried to push him away, but he was stronger.” He said that Father Pawel “laughed at my resistance. He laughed at my helplessness.” The influence of the Catholic Church in Poland is immense — almost 40 percent of the population attends Mass weekly. And it is politically connected, particularly on the right: The church enjoys significant financial privileges from the state, while the ruling Law and Justice party benefits from the support of Catholic media outlets and church sermons. The strength of the church is the strength of Law and Justice, and a crisis in the church is a crisis for Law and Justice. Law and Justice is also implicated in the abuse cover-ups. One of the party’s best-known figures, Stanislaw Piotrowicz, made his name in 2001, when as a prosecutor in the town of Krosno he dismissed a case against a priest accused of raping six girls. Mr. Piotrowicz argued, “The priest confirmed that he took children into his lap, children would run up to him during catechism, they would hug him, he, too, would hug them, caress them, he sometimes kissed them. The children were happy, they were content. There was no sexual subtext.” After the case was transferred to a different jurisdiction, the priest was convicted. Mr. Piotrowicz, meanwhile, received a medal from Archbishop Jozef Michalik, who expressed compassion for the convicted priest and accused the media of trampling the truth and displaying hostility toward the church. He encouraged the faithful to maintain their trust in the clergyman. As he said of the victims, “A child clings to you, it searches and loses itself and draws the other person in.” As he rose through the political ranks, Mr. Piotrowicz became one of the architects of the legal “reforms” supported by Law and Justice, hamstringing the Constitutional Tribunal and removing judges from the Supreme Court. He became a furious red baiter, shouting “down with Communism!” from the rostrum, although as a Communist prosecutor in the 1980s he convicted opposition leaders under martial law. Naturally, Law and Justice has pushed back hard against Mr. Sekielski’s documentary. One member of Parliament, Zbigniew Gryglas, compared it to “Mein Kampf.” Deputy Speaker Ryszard Terlecki asserted that it was part of a conspiracy to influence the upcoming elections (though he also boasted that he has not seen the film). Church leaders called it “nonsense” and “old fairy tales.” At the same time, the government has announced a bill to increase penalties for pedophilia, though the bill must first by considered by a committee chaired by none other than Stanislaw Piotrowicz. The Law and Justice and Church faithful have every right to be disoriented. In today’s highly polarized Poland, elections are won thanks to large-scale voter mobilization. And that’s what is happening now — people are angry at both institutions. That may prove the deciding factor in whether or not the party retains power. The first poll since the documentary appeared shows that the opposition European Coalition ranks 10 percent above Law and Justice, 43.6 percent to 33 percent, a 6 percentage-point drop in a week for the ruling party. But something bigger is afoot. More than almost any country in Europe, the church retains its centuries-old grip on Polish life. Will this scandal finally loosen it? Perhaps; secularism is already on the rise. Recently, the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza published research indicating that most Polish students wanted religious education removed from public school curriculums. And while mass attendance remains strong, just a quarter of Poles under 40 years old go weekly. The Catholic Church was once the country’s greatest moral authority; Poland gave the Church Pope John Paul II, and the Church helped end communism in the country. Then it got involved in politics. The Church is now close to losing whatever moral authority it once had.

2019,Opinion | Will the Legitimacy of the Supreme Court Survive the Census Case?,"Last year, the court overlooked the anti-Muslim animus of the travel ban and ruled for the administration. It should not be taken in again. Mr. Geltzer is the executive director and a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. The Supreme Court is poised to decide one of its most divisive cases since litigation around the travel ban: the challenge to the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Even as the justices deliberate on this case, shocking new reporting offers critical support to opponents of the administration’s position. It strongly suggests that the justification from Trump administration lawyers, in their presentation before the Supreme Court, for adding a census question on citizenship was an outright falsehood, or at the least a deliberate pretext. A recently deceased Republican strategist, whose 2015 study showed that adding a citizenship question to the census would supercharge pro-Republican gerrymandering, provided the actual rationale and wrote key language that informed a Justice Department letter claiming that the citizenship question was needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act. We have seen this drama before. Last year, the Supreme Court faced similar questions of blatant misrepresentation from the Trump administration in the case on the travel ban. The court overlooked the sketchy details in that case and decided in the administration’s favor. In this term’s most important matter, the court should not be taken in. During the travel ban case, I remember sitting in the courtroom astonished when the solicitor general claimed to the justices that President Trump had “made crystal-clear” that he had “no intention of imposing the Muslim ban” — a ban that, as a candidate, Mr. Trump had repeatedly promised. In such a case, the justices look for evidence of animus against a particular group. And so establishing the connection between Mr. Trump’s pervasive anti-Muslim remarks and the ban he promulgated was a core aspect of the challengers’ argument. Ultimately, the conservative justices in the majority voted to uphold the ban, deciding that it was a valid exercise of the president’s authority. In the census case, which the Supreme Court will soon decide, the administration was challenged on the grounds that the addition of a citizenship question violated proper administrative procedures and would violate, by design, the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by discriminating against minority groups and immigrants, especially of certain nationalities. In three federal lawsuits, judges have ruled against the administration’s action. Much as I was taken aback a year ago as the travel ban case was argued, during argument day for the census case I was astonished to hear the solicitor general insist that the question’s addition was intended to facilitate enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The facts brought out at trial made clear that this was a mere pretext for a pre-existing commitment to adding a citizenship question. The information recently revealed from the Republican strategist confirms in dramatic fashion what the trial record already showed: The Trump administration’s actual reason for the citizenship question is entrenching Republican political power. Adding the question, according to opponents of the move, would deter many immigrants from participating in the census and thus from being counted, which would in turn help Republicans. A letter filed on Thursday with the Supreme Court rightly says that adding the question began as an effort “to create a structural electoral advantage” for “‘Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.’” And a judge in the United States District Court in Manhattan, who had ruled against adding the question, set a hearing for next week to evaluate, among other implications, whether these documents mean that key witnesses lied during trial. The hearing may produce stark evidence directly relevant to the Supreme Court’s handling of the case. On Thursday, the Justice Department said that the new information was merely “a last-ditch effort to derail the Supreme Court’s consideration of this case” and added that the 2015 study had “played no role” in the department’s request to reinstate a citizenship question. The Justice Department also said that it will explain itself in a court filing. Perhaps there’s some explanation for why this isn’t the smoking gun it appears to be. But we already have a shooting gallery of smoking guns from the trial record demonstrating that the Trump administration’s justification was mere pretext. The new evidence has made it, at a minimum, a lot smokier. The legitimacy of our judicial system depends on judges and justices deciding cases on the facts — the real facts, not a distortion of them offered by one party to a case. The Supreme Court now faces a choice: How will a majority of the justices handle another attempt by the Trump administration to mislead the court? There is a sad history, dating at least as far back as the infamous Korematsu decision during World War II — a shameful decision upholding the forcible relocation and internment of Japanese-Americans — of the court reaching unfortunate decisions based on misrepresentations by the government that are later proved false. But there’s still time for the court to get the census case right by looking past the pretext to the Trump administration’s real motivation for adding a citizenship question. For the sake of its own legitimacy, the court must do so and avoid getting snookered by Trump’s lawyers. Joshua A.

2019,William Barr Hearing: Highlights of His Testimony,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr on Wednesday answered questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Robert S. Mueller III’s report, appearing on Capitol Hill for the first time since he made the report public. The hearing was expected to be the first of two appearances on back-to-back days, but later on Wednesday, Representative Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced that Mr. Barr was expected to skip his planned testimony on Thursday. Mr. Barr objects to Democrats’ plans to have a staff lawyer question him. Here are the highlights of his testimony on Wednesday. Democrats pressed Mr. Barr on a letter that Mr. Mueller wrote in March accusing him of failing to capture “the context, nature and substance” of the special counsel’s report in outlining its findings weeks before releasing the document. They accused Mr. Barr of obfuscation and outright lying because he made no mention of the letter when asked in congressional testimony last month about reports that investigators were dismayed about how he portrayed their findings. [Read the letter here.] Mr. Barr tried to redirect the conversation to Mr. Mueller’s complaints in a phone call about news coverage of Mr. Barr’s March 24 letter summarizing the investigation’s conclusions. And when asked about his earlier testimony, he said that he viewed a question about Mr. Mueller’s investigators being upset as different from a question about Mr. Mueller himself being upset. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, called that response “masterful hairsplitting.” He was also dismissive of the complaints in Mr. Mueller’s letter. “The letter’s a bit snitty,” Mr. Barr said near the end of the hearing, “and I think it was probably written by one of his staff people.” Mr. Trump may finally have an attorney general who will protect him. Mr. Barr defended some of Mr. Trump’s attempts to impede the inquiry, including dangling pardons in front of witnesses and telling them not to “flip”; asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions to retake control of the inquiry after recusing himself; and instructing Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to remove Mr. Mueller from the investigation, citing conflicts of interest. Democrats said the episodes constituted a concerning, if not unlawful, pattern of behavior. But Mr. Barr viewed them as discrete events that, when taken alone, were legally fine. When the president asked his associates not to “flip,” Mr. Barr said that Mr. Trump meant it in a narrow sense. He said that the president could ask a subordinate to unrecuse himself, and that asking to remove Mr. Mueller “suggests you’re going to have another special counsel,” not that the president wanted an end to the investigation. Democrats, distrustful of Mr. Barr and his characterizations of the special counsel’s work, had a consistent refrain: What does Bob Mueller have to say? “This committee needs to hear directly from Special Counsel Mueller,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in her opening remarks. Nearly every Democrat on the committee echoed her. Mr. Barr said he had no objection to Mr. Mueller testifying, but Democratic committee leaders in the House who have already extended invitations said the Justice Department had slow-walked or stonewalled requests to secure a date. Mr. Nadler said Wednesday that his committee was circling around May 15 and was trying to “firm up” an appearance on that date. As Democrats tried to poke cracks in Mr. Barr’s defense of the president, Republicans voiced their support for him. They glossed over damaging episodes in the report and called for investigations of Mr. Trump’s investigators and a political rival. “I appreciate very much what Mr. Mueller did for the country. I have read most of the report,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the committee’s chairman. “For me, it is over.” That was a good sign for the president. If Mr. Trump can hold Republicans together, he diminishes the chances of an impeachment inquiry. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and her lieutenants have consistently said they see little value in pursuing a purely partisan impeachment, and they worry that if they did, an overwhelming acquittal of the president in the Senate would only strengthen him politically. Some Republicans went further and previewed plans to renew scrutiny of the Russia investigation and of the F.B.I.’s treatment of Hillary Clinton. Such inquiries could always turn up new evidence, and at the very least they will further muddy the waters over what occurred in 2016 and who is responsible. “What we have heard is as baseless as any conspiracy theory that we have heard in politics,” Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said of assertions that Russia had compromised Mr. Trump. Mr. Barr clarified that he had initiated a review of the F.B.I.’s actions in the early days of the Russia investigation. His team is already at work, he said, and he plans to share the results with Congress. “Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant,” he said, referring to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to wiretap a former campaign adviser, Carter Page. “I would like to find out whether that is, in fact, true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop the threat as it’s being represented.” When he came under fire from Democrats for labeling court-authorized surveillance as “spying,” which they said fed Trump-backed conspiracies that the government illegally monitored his campaign, Mr. Barr insisted he had nothing to apologize for. “I don’t think it has a pejorative connotation at all,” he told Mr. Whitehouse. Instead, Mr. Barr said, he was interested in whether any surveillance of anyone on the Trump campaign had been justified and properly carried out. Mr. Barr had been scheduled to appear for a second, more combative hearing on Thursday before the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee. But after his marathon session in the Senate, Mr. Nadler, the committee’s chairman, said Mr. Barr was expected to skip the appearance. Mr. Barr and committee Democrats have been locked in a procedural dispute. Democrats voted to give staff lawyers time to question Mr. Barr at length after lawmakers get a chance. Mr. Barr objects. “The administration has a nerve to dictate our procedures,” Mr. Nadler said during a news conference. “It's simply part of the administration's complete stonewalling of Congress.” He added that Mr. Barr was “terrified of having to face a skilled attorney.” A Justice Department spokeswoman responded by saying that the proposed format was “unnecessary.” “Chairman Nadler’s insistence on having staff question the Attorney General, a Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, is inappropriate,” said Kerri Kupec, the spokeswoman. She added that several members of the committee, including Mr. Nadler, are attorneys.",The New York Times
2019,"William Barr, Colorado, Royal Baby: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “This is not a step we take lightly.” That was Representative Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, above, as Democrats moved toward holding Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report. The vote, along party lines, came hours after President Trump asserted executive privilege, the first of his term, over the same material. The Justice Department called the vote an unnecessary and overwrought reaction. Separately, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, was subpoenaed by a Republican-led Senate panel to testify about a meeting with Russians after he was promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. _____ 2. President Trump took a hard line on trade talks with China ahead of the arrival of the country’s vice premier in Washington, indicating a quick resolution was out of reach. In response, Beijing suggested it was ready to retaliate should Mr. Trump follow through on new tariff increases on Friday. Above, a port in Lianyungang, China, in February. Despite a couple of down days this week, the markets aren’t sweating the trade deal. The president has tended to back off threats whenever stocks and the economy have looked soft, our economics correspondent explains. _____ 3. In other international news: Iran said it would stop complying with parts of the nuclear deal, escalating a confrontation with the U.S. The Trump administration is planning to issue new sanctions against Iran that many believe are intended to force its leaders from power. Above, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, inspecting nuclear technology in April. Mr. Trump’s approach to foreign intervention is “largely ad hoc and idiosyncratic,” our White House correspondent writes in an analysis, “driven less by ideology than by his hunger for foreign policy victories and confidence in his own deal-making skills.” _____ 4. New details emerged from the school shooting in a Denver suburb that left eight injured and one dead. Students at STEM School Highlands Ranch were in the last period of the day watching “The Princess Bride” when one of their classmates walked in and pulled out a gun. That was when Kendrick Castillo, 18, lunged at the gunman and was fatally shot. The authorities identified the suspects as an 18-year-old man and a juvenile girl, both in custody, as they continued to investigate an assault that reached “deep inside the school.” _____ 5. Yesterday we reported that Georgia was the latest state to ban abortions at the first sign of a fetal heartbeat. Alabama may go even further. Lawmakers there are seeking to criminalize the procedure and effectively ban abortions at every stage of pregnancy. The proposal calls for doctors to face up to 99 years in prison for performing the procedure. Above, the State Capitol in Montgomery. It is the latest in a broad array of restrictions speeding through statehouses in the South and Midwest. If approved, the law would be a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade in a newly aligned Supreme Court. _____ 6. Boeing’s charm offensive is not going well. The company has been making daily calls with carriers, offering tours of its 737 Max factory, above in Renton, Wash., and meeting with pilots and flight attendants in an effort to win back trust. But those overtures have been met with skepticism after Boeing’s early bungled response to deadly crashes involving the 737 Max. In other business news, three Somali women working for Amazon near Minneapolis accused the company of creating a hostile environment for Muslim workers and retaliating against them for protesting their work conditions. _____ 7. Can big data succeed where conventional medicine fails? Michael Snyder, a geneticist at Stanford University, above, is betting on it. Among 109 volunteers whose bodies were closely tracked and analyzed, he and researchers discovered a host of hidden conditions that required medical attention, including diabetes and heart disease. Dr. Snyder believes that such “deep profiles” of patients may provide early warning signs of disease. But critics say the approach amounts to “carpet-bombing” the body with tests. Also from our science desk: Using a quantum computer, physicists successfully reversed time for an artificial atom. But don’t get your hopes up for time travel anytime soon. _____ 8. An official welcome to Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, who will be known as “Master Archie.” Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, introduced their two-day-old son at Windsor Castle. The newborn slept through his first interview before meeting the queen, his great-grandmother. His parents chose not to give him a royal title like “earl” or “lord.” Speaking of babies: We kicked off NYT Parenting, offering guidance for those bringing up children and those thinking about having them. One thing we won’t do is use the term “natural childbirth.” Here’s why. We also have a handy guide on how to make baby food. _____ 9. And now for our 52 Places Traveler’s next stops: Batumi, Georgia, and Eilat, Israel. But the best moments on his 13th and 14th visits didn’t happen there. Facing rain on the Black Sea in Georgia and crushing crowds on the Red Sea in Israel, he found delights off the beaten track instead, like a ride on a Soviet-era cable car in the village of Khulo, Georgia, above. “If the joy of serendipity is one of the reasons to travel, then improvisation is how you get there,” he writes. We also retraced Truman Capote’s footsteps in the Mediterranean, where he escaped to seaside idylls in southern Italy and Spain. It was there that his great novels came to fruition. _____ 10. And finally, a salad for the ages. For the last three years, Samin Nosrat has been obsessed with a particular green salad. The star of the Netflix cooking show “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat” does not typically feel this passionate about a basic salad. Then she tasted the insalate verde at Via Carota in New York. Bite by bite, she has tried “to decipher what makes it so unbelievably, mouth-smackingly perfect,” Ms. Nosrat writes. She finally asked for the recipe and discovered the secret ingredient was water. Ms. Nosrat shares her salad journey, and the recipe, this week in The Times Magazine. Enjoy, and have a delicious evening. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

2019,"William Barr, Facebook, Scrabble: Your Thursday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “That’s a crime.” That’s what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said about Attorney General William Barr’s testimony in April, when he said was unaware that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had protested Mr. Barr’s portrayal of his report’s conclusions. She said that testimony was false. The statement came after House Democrats threatened to hold Mr. Barr in contempt of Congress after he failed to appear at a hearing of the Judiciary Committee. The attorney general also ignored a subpoena deadline to hand over Mr. Mueller’s unredacted report. Democrats are hoping to secure testimony from Mr. Mueller himself on May 15. Separately, the F.B.I. used an investigator posing as a researcher to meet with a Trump campaign aide in 2016. The decision showed the level of the alarm in the bureau as officials uncovered the scope of Russia’s election interference. _____ 2. In other news out of Washington: President Trump said he would not nominate Stephen Moore for the Federal Reserve after all. Several Republicans had raised concerns over Mr. Moore’s views of women. It is the second time in recent weeks that one of Mr. Trump’s Fed picks was forced to withdraw. The Trump administration is also set to detail its weakening of offshore-drilling safety rules put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, above. And on Capitol Hill, the House passed legislation that would block President Trump from leaving the Paris Agreement, the first major global warming bill to win congressional approval in a decade. But it stands virtually no chance of approval in the Republican-controlled Senate. _____ 3. How do you make room for all 21 Democratic candidates on one debate stage? You don’t. The Democratic National Committee has capped the first debate at 20 candidates. Now that Senator Michael Bennet, above, has announced his candidacy for president, someone is likely to be left out. Here’s how the candidates qualify for a debate. We also look at Senator Elizabeth Warren’s campaign, which has hired big in Iowa. At 50 paid staff members on the ground, it is far more than any other Democratic candidate’s and reflects a bet that an early, large staff will give her an advantage over her rivals. _____ 4. Facebook is cracking down on hate speech. The social media platform barred seven controversial personalities from its services, including Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and founder of Infowars, and Louis Farrakhan, the outspoken black nationalist minister. Above, Facebook’s operations center in Menlo Park, Calif. The company said they were barred from using Facebook and Instagram under Facebook’s policies against “dangerous individuals and organizations.” _____ 5. A Boston jury found executives of Insys Therapeutics guilty of racketeering. They were accused of bribing doctors to prescribe an addictive painkiller. After deliberating for 15 days, the federal jury convicted the company’s founder, the one-time billionaire John Kapoor, of all charges in the case. Mr. Kapoor, pictured above in March, is one of the most senior pharmaceutical executives to be prosecuted on felony charges in the opioids epidemic. Prosecutors had detailed how Insys’ marketing plan, which included paying doctors for sham educational talks, sought to spur sales of its painkiller. _____ 6. Parents of newborns have another worry to add to their list: measles. The nationwide measles outbreak, now in 22 states, has upended family routines. The vaccine is not usually given to children until they are a year old, so some new parents are avoiding public places and anti-vaccine friends. “There are just some places that we don’t go,” said Lucretia Sims, above, with her 7-month-old son, Ayden. Separately, the Caribbean nation of St. Lucia quarantined a cruise ship reportedly owned by the Church of Scientology over a case of measles on board. And a bill to end religious exemptions for vaccinations has stalled in New York, an epicenter of the outbreak. _____ 7. Wages are finally rising — 10 years after the recession. Lagging pay in the lengthy recovery defied logic, and then wage growth suddenly picked up. Average hourly earnings have been up for eight straight months, fueled in part by minimum-wage increases in cities and states across the country and a tightening labor market. We look at why it took so long and which workers are benefiting. For people without a college degree, finding work that offers decent pay can be a challenge. The solution may require a change in scenery. To Toledo, Ohio, for instance, above. Here’s where all the good jobs are. _____ 8. Before the #MeToo movement, Woody Allen’s memoir would probably have set off a bidding war. Today, publishers aren’t interested. Executives at several houses said they passed on the material, saying working with him now would be “toxic” because of controversies surrounding Mr. Allen, pictured above in 2016. Mr. Allen’s agent declined to comment. Our book critic looked at the wave of #MeToo novels, writing that they are reminders of the kind of touchy ethical explorations fiction makes possible. And how has #MeToo affected the stage? Our critic at large says that in some modern Broadway adaptations, women fare better than in the originals, but it’s usually the men who need changing. _____ 9. Can an art collective become the Disney of the experience economy? That’s what the founders of Meow Wolf are betting on. What began as a group of unknown anarchic collective artists in Santa Fe, N.M., turned into a multimillion-dollar dream factory anchoring an “immersive bazaar” in Las Vegas. It’s part of The Times Magazine’s money issue out this weekend. For a different kind of experience: It’s a big weekend for art fairs in New York, with Frieze New York and Tefaf taking center stage. They can be a bit pricey, so here are some alternatives to the main fairs. _____ 10. Finally, “OK” for 6 points. The international Scrabble dictionary is gaining 2,800 words, including “mansplain,” “bae” and the much-debated “OK.” While the four-letter spelling “okay” was already approved, the shorter version had not been included because of debate about whether it was an abbreviation. “I’d say 95 percent of the people in the community agreed with the decision,” said the co-president of the North American Scrabble Players Association, “but the 5 percent of people who disagreed were disproportionately loud.” Have a playful evening. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

2019,"William Barr, Joe Biden, India: Your Thursday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re covering the attorney general’s Senate testimony, the widening college admissions scandal, and a North Carolina student who is being hailed as a hero. The attorney general said he would not testify today before the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee, a day after a contentious Senate hearing in which he defended his handling of the special counsel investigation. Mr. Barr rebuffed accusations that he had misrepresented the conclusions reached by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and dismissed Mr. Mueller’s complaints about an initial summary of the report as “a bit snitty.” News analysis: Whether Mr. Barr used his powers neutrally or abused them to create a more favorable impression for the president was a focus of the hearing, our Washington correspondent writes. See for yourself: Read Mr. Mueller’s letter, and review crucial moments from the testimony. The Daily: In today’s episode, our congressional reporter tells us about the day in the hearing room. Perspective: In an Op-Ed, the former F.B.I. director James Comey writes about Mr. Barr and his relationship with President Trump: “Amoral leaders have a way of revealing the character of those around them.” The Trump administration has described the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, as a despot who must be replaced. But Mr. Maduro’s endurance in the face of a mass uprising this week has raised questions about whether Washington had faulty intelligence about the strength of the opposition. Read more in our news analysis. Another angle: A secret dossier compiled by Venezuelan agents warned that a confidant of Mr. Maduro had been linked to drug traffickers and militants. The documents offer a window into how fractured and nervous the nation’s security services have become. As vice president, Mr. Biden played a key role in the dismissal of a prosecutor in Ukraine who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption. Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch in the sights of the fired prosecutor. The broad outlines have been known for some time, and Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign said that his actions in the matter had been consistent with U.S. foreign policy. But the renewed scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s experience in Ukraine has been encouraged by allies of President Trump. Related: After a national firefighters’ union formally endorsed Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump criticized the group’s leadership, signaling a potential fight over the support of blue-collar voters. More parents have been informed that they are under investigation in the nation’s largest-ever college admissions inquiry, stirring speculation about which executive or celebrity might be charged next. Prosecutors first announced charges against 50 people in March, describing a brazen scheme of cheating on college entrance exams and bribing officials to secure admission to universities like Stanford, the University of Southern California and Yale. By the numbers: One family paid $6.5 million to get their daughter into Stanford. What’s next: Three students have been sent target letters, raising the prospect that they could face criminal charges. Patrick Cumaiyi waved to his family with shackled hands as he boarded a plane to face a domestic-violence complaint in northern Australia. Before takeoff, an argument broke out, an officer delivered a sharp blow to Mr. Cumaiyi’s head, and another officer dragged him headfirst onto the tarmac. Medical records obtained by The Times suggest he is a victim not only of police brutality — a persistent problem for Indigenous Australians — but also of a cover-up. North Carolina shooting: Riley Howell, 21, saved many lives by tackling the gunman at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the police said. Mr. Howell was one of two students killed on the campus Tuesday evening. The 2020 race: Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, announced today he was running for president. Facebook settlement: The social media company is set to create oversight roles to strengthen its privacy practices as part of a deal with the Federal Trade Commission. Snapshot: Above, a fisherman in Visakhapatnam, India, before the arrival of Cyclone Fani, which is expected to hit the eastern coast on Friday. Hundreds of thousands of people have evacuated. Overlooked obituaries: In 1901, Annie Edson Taylor became, in her early 60s, the first person to survive going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. She’s the latest entry in our series of people who didn’t receive obituaries in The Times when they died. Late-night comedy: All the hosts addressed William Barr’s Senate appearance to answer questions about the Mueller investigation (or, as Trevor Noah referred to it, “the longest-running saga that doesn’t have Iron Man in it”). What we’re reading: This conversation with Anjelica Huston in Vulture. “It’s as good as everyone is saying,” writes Katie Rogers, one of our White House correspondents. Cook: When an average salad won’t do, Samin Nosrat’s greenest green salad will satisfy. Watch: With “Avengers: Endgame” hijacking the box office — and the cultural conversation — five writers discuss these superhero-saturated times we live in. Read: “The Moment of Lift,” featuring stories about empowering women, by the philanthropist Melinda Gates, debuts on our hardcover nonfiction and combined print and e-book nonfiction best-seller lists. Listen: On its own, “Cellophane” by FKA twigs would be striking enough. The accompanying video clip only multiplies the strangeness. Smarter Living: Allergies can be torture. Immunotherapy — shots that can help desensitize you to allergens — can help over time. If needles aren’t your thing, cleaning the filter of your air-conditioner or furnace can keep indoor air cleaner. Vacuum often. Mattress protectors keep dust mites out. Pillow protectors are also an option. And we asked you for the best advice you’ve ever received, and how it affected your life. Here’s what you said. A recent feature by our Berlin bureau chief tracked how Germany’s far right had adopted anti-immigrant tropes in discussing an influx from Poland of “the most notorious fairy-tale baddie”: the wolf. Connecting nationalism and fairy tales is not new. The Brothers Grimm, who based their tales on folk tradition, lived and worked in the 19th century, when Europe was brimming with enthusiasm for the nation-state over multiethnic empires. Artists and writers reached for ancient myths to feed the ideal of a national culture. That legacy lives on not only in children’s books but also in concert halls: Jean Sibelius picked tales from the Finnish national epic “Kalevala,” and Bela Bartok collected folk songs from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But when populists pick up the tales and myths, they often seem to stray far from the artists’ intentions. “Even if musical folklore once owed a debt to nationalism, today, ultranationalism hurts it so much that the damage is far greater than the benefit once was,” Bartok wrote in an essay in 1937. This week, we told you about South Korean grandmothers who are learning to read and write for the first time.

2019,"William Barr, Kentucky Derby, Met Gala: Your Weekend Briefing","Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. Attorney General William Barr has a deadline to meet Monday or else he may face contempt of Congress. House Democrats want the Justice Department to hand over the special counsel’s full report and its underlying evidence, and gave Mr. Barr until tomorrow to do so. The threat came days after Mr. Barr had testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, above, but had skipped a House hearing on the same topic. President Trump has also vowed to resist all subpoenas. Here’s how it could all play out. In other Trump administration news, North Korea fired a volley of projectiles off its east coast early Saturday morning in a move that analysts said was intended to escalate the pressure on Mr. Trump to return to the negotiating table. And coming up this week: President Trump will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Tiger Woods, and trade talks with China enter their final days. But there’s one subject that’s been left conspicuously off the negotiating table: human rights. Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. ____ 2. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is focusing on 2020. The speaker’s plan for defeating President Trump, who she worries would challenge a slim Democratic victory in 2020, focuses on moderate voters and on avoiding a protracted impeachment bid. We sat down with her for an interview at the Capitol. On the 2020 campaign trail, Joe Biden has focused on Mr. Trump as the source of the nation’s ills, exposing a rift with other Democrats who see the president as a symptom of something deeper. Meanwhile, Democrats are confronting a harsh reality: Top-tier candidates are refusing to run for the Senate, putting their chances of flipping the chamber at risk. ____ 3. The worst is over in India as Cyclone Fani, one of the biggest storms in years, passed over the subcontinent. The storm washed out countless homes and farms, but by Saturday evening local time, fewer than 20 deaths had been reported in India. Above, destruction in Puri, India. That’s because India and neighboring Bangladesh embarked on a massive evacuation, whisking more than a million people to safety in each country. It was a meticulous plan that they had been perfecting for 20 years. ____ 4. In other international news: Fighting between Israel and Gaza escalated rapidly in the worst combat since the last full-blown war in 2014. We also had news out of Venezuela, where the leader of the opposition, Juan Guaidó, called for a military and popular uprising to oust President Nicolás Maduro from office. But the effort failed to change the status quo, leaving both parties still scrambling for power. Here’s what you need to know about the crisis and how the recent uprisings can provide some context.

2019,"William Barr, Myanmar, Met Gala: Your Tuesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re covering the U.S-China trade talks and Myanmar’s release of two journalists. We’ve also got photos (lots of photos) from last night’s Met Gala. President Trump’s top economic aides on Monday accused China of retreating from previous commitments to resolve a monthslong trade war and said that Mr. Trump would increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods on Friday. Mr. Trump’s decision to potentially upend an agreement that many expected to be finalized this week comes as he and his advisers have pointed to strong first-quarter economic growth as vindication that their tough approach is working. What’s next: A final trade agreement could still be reached. China announced today that Vice Premier Liu He, a leading economic policymaker, would join a delegation traveling to Washington for talks on Thursday and Friday. His participation may increase the odds of a deal. Perspective: In an Op-Ed, an expert on Asian affairs writes that President Xi Jinping might have overreached and stands to lose face if an agreement is reached. As many as one million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction, posing a dire threat to ecosystems that people depend on, according to a sweeping United Nations assessment. The 1,500-page report, a summary of which was released on Monday, is the most exhaustive look yet at the decline in biodiversity. As a result of global warming, biodiversity loss is projected to accelerate through 2050, particularly in the tropics, without drastic increases in conservation. Quotable: “For a long time, people just thought of biodiversity as saving nature for its own sake,” said Robert Watson, chairman of the group that conducted the assessment. “But this report makes clear the links between biodiversity and nature and things like food security and clean water in both rich and poor countries.” The showdown between the executive and legislative branches became more tense on Monday, as the Trump administration ruled out turning over the president’s personal and business tax returns to the House and prepared for a contempt of Congress resolution against Attorney General William Barr. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that a House committee’s demand for the returns “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.” Democrats are almost certain to contest the decision in court. (Read Mr. Mnuchin’s letter to lawmakers.) Related: The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote for Wednesday on a recommendation to hold Mr. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for Robert Mueller’s full report. The violence over the weekend might look pointless to the outside world, but analysts say it is part of a series of clashes that benefits the two main antagonists: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu is able to support his argument that the Palestinians aren’t ready for peace and that a two-state solution is impossible. Hamas, which apparently received assurances of a loosening of Israel’s blockade in the cease-fire deal on Monday, gets to show that its strategy of armed resistance is working. Read more in a news analysis from our Jerusalem bureau chief. Yesterday: The cease-fire appeared to hold after fighting that killed at least 22 Palestinians, including militants and children, and four Israeli civilians. Riley Howell, 21, was one of two students who were killed last week in a classroom at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The pictures above were displayed at his viewing ceremony over the weekend. His parents said he died as he lived: headlong and helpfully. Mr. Howell was credited with tackling the gunman and preventing a far greater massacre. We spoke to his family and friends. Myanmar releases journalists: Two Pulitzer Prize-winning Reuters reporters were freed from prison today after more than a year in detention for covering the country’s deadly crackdown on the Rohingya minority group. U.S.-Iran tensions: The Trump administration on Monday accused Tehran and militias that it supports of threatening American troops, and Iran signaled that it might soon violate part of the 2015 nuclear deal. New election in Turkey: The electoral authorities have wiped away a crushing defeat for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ordering a rerun of the March election for mayor of Istanbul. “Magic” mushroom vote: Denver, which has been at the forefront of the debate over legalizing marijuana, will decide today whether to be the first city in the nation to effectively decriminalize hallucinogenic mushrooms. Snapshot: Above, Lady Gaga arriving at the Met Gala on Monday. The fuchsia dress with an enormous train was one of several outfits that she revealed. See more photographs here. Britain’s royal baby: Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and the wife of Prince Harry, has given birth to a boy. A name has not yet been announced for the baby, who is seventh in line to the British throne. Kentucky Derby ruling: An appeal by the owners of the disqualified winner, Maximum Security, has been denied by state regulators. The horse’s co-owner said he would skip the Preakness Stakes, the second race in the Triple Crown competition. Restaurant awards: Kwame Onwuachi of the Washington restaurant Kith and Kin was named Rising Star Chef at the James Beard Foundation’s annual awards ceremony. Frenchette, a popular brasserie in New York, was named Best New Restaurant. Late-night comedy: The hosts were puzzled after President Trump called President Vladimir Putin last week and discussed, among other things, the special counsel’s report on Russia’s election interference. “This is like robbing a bank and then trying to open a new account during the robbery,” Seth Meyers said. What we’re reading: This consideration of John Singleton in The Atlantic. Caryn Wilson, a senior editor for politics, recommends its argument that Mr. Singleton’s film “Poetic Justice” was an answer to critics who said his portrayal of black women in the Oscar-nominated film “Boyz N the Hood” was one-note and reductive. Cook: If it’s an “eggs for dinner” kind of night, try Melissa Clark’s skillet greens with runny eggs, peas and pancetta. Go: The playwright Tori Sampson defines all four characters in “Cadillac Crew” with the same phrase: “a powerhouse of a young woman.” It’s playing at the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven. Watch: The Sundance TV series “State of the Union” offers a formidable concentration of talent in 10-minute servings. Read: If you like memoirs that revolve around singular experiences, Lara Prior-Palmer’s “Rough Magic” delivers. Smarter Living: Rather than trying to find the “correct” solution to a problem, sometimes it’s worth asking what the problem arises from — and then stop doing that. Know that you may have to overcome resistance to quitting, especially if you’ve already invested time and energy in considering solutions. And we have tips on buying a rug that really ties the room together. In 1980, a new toy hit U.S. markets and set off a worldwide craze. It was a cube-shaped puzzle that had been designed in 1974 by the Hungarian architect and professor Erno Rubik. It was sold in his country as Magic Cube. Within two years of expanding beyond the Hungarian market as Rubik’s Cube, millions had been purchased worldwide. The puzzle’s initial popularity fizzled. Then came the internet. By the early 2000s, devoted cubers began to connect through online forums and YouTube to share the steps toward getting each of the nine “cubies” on all six faces to display the same color. The sport of speedcubing took off. Among the Rubik’s Cube competitions now governed by the World Cube Association are solving cubes for the fastest times with a single hand (6.88 seconds), blindfolded (16.22 seconds) and with feet (16.96 seconds).

2019,"William Barr, North Carolina, Fossils: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “I’m not in the business of determining when lies are told to the American people. I am in the business of determining when a crime has been committed.” Attorney General William Barr spent much of the day answering questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee about the special counsel’s report on Russian election meddling and possible obstruction of justice. Democrats pressed Mr. Barr on why he had not publicly acknowledged concerns about his original summary and why he said that Mr. Trump had cooperated fully with the investigation when he tried to thwart it. Republicans focused not on Mr. Trump or Mr. Mueller’s report but on Hillary Clinton’s emails and the former F.B.I. officials who opened the Russia investigation. We have video clips and takeaways from the hearing. Hours after Mr. Barr finished testifying, a congressional aide said the attorney general was expected to skip a House hearing Thursday on the Mueller report. He and Democrats have fought over its format. _____ 2. The attorney general spent much of his time defending his four-page summary of the Mueller report. Minutes before Mr. Barr was set to testify, the Justice Department released a letter from March that showed a deep a rift between the special counsel Robert Mueller and Mr. Barr. Mr. Mueller criticized the summary as failing to capture the “context, nature and substance” of the 448-page document. “The letter is a bit snitty, and I think it was probably written by a member of his staff,” Mr. Barr said at Wednesday’s hearing. In our Opinion section, the former F.B.I. director James Comey offers his take on Mr. Barr’s handling of the Mueller report. _____ 3. The national firefighters’ union endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. President Trump responded on Twitter. In an early-morning blizzard of 60 tweets and retweets, Mr. Trump attacked the union’s leadership. The number is unusual even for Mr. Trump, and it seems a clear sign that Mr. Trump is anxious about the loyalty of the rank-and-file union voters he reached in 2016. Above, Mr. Biden at a campaign event in Pittsburgh on Monday. In other Washington news, the White House asked Congress to allocate $4.5 billion in emergency funds for the southwestern border as federal agencies struggle to address the influx of asylum seekers coming into the U.S. _____ 4. The Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó called on civilians to rise up against President Nicolás Maduro for a second day of protests, imploring supporters to show a mighty May Day presence. But it was unclear whether the antigovernment demonstrations were a convincing rejoinder to the setback Mr. Guaidó suffered on Tuesday, when he failed to convince the military to switch sides. Separately, French police officers fired tear gas after violence broke out at the May Day labor rally in Paris, with masked vandals mixing with demonstrators, smashing vehicles and throwing rocks. _____ 5. “He took the assailant off his feet,” a police chief in North Carolina said. “Absolutely, Mr. Howell saved lives.” He was speaking of Riley Howell, 21, a student who tackled a gunman at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte on Tuesday evening. He saved many lives, but lost his own. Above, a prayer gathering near the university last night. The authorities have declined to speculate on the motive for the shooting. A 22-year-old suspect has been charged with 12 crimes, including two counts of murder. Here is what we know — and still don’t know — about the attack. _____ 6. Heads are still rolling in the college admissions scandal. Prosecutors are pursuing more parents in the nation’s largest-ever college admissions investigation, spreading fear in Southern California’s elite circles. Some have been informed that they are under investigation. Others worry that they will be. “This is the only thing they can think about,” one lawyer said. We also tracked down a Chinese family who paid $6.5 million to try to get their daughter admitted to Stanford University, pictured above, as a recruited athlete. Separately, two fraternities at Swarthmore College said they would disband after the release of more than 100 pages of internal documents in which members discussed sexual misconduct and referred to a “rape attic.” _____ 7. Female athletes with elevated male hormones can be barred from track races against other women, the highest court in sports ruled. The landmark ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport was a defeat for the South African athlete Caster Semenya, a two-time Olympic champion at 800 meters, who had challenged proposed limits placed on female athletes with naturally elevated levels of testosterone. Above center, Ms. Semenya at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. In a statement, her lawyers said they may appeal the decision, arguing that her “unique genetic gift should be celebrated, not regulated.” In other sports news, C.C. Sabathia of the Yankees became the 17th pitcher, and only the third left-hander, to reach 3,000 strikeouts. _____ 8. A fossil found in a Tibetan cave suggests that an ancient human species once roamed across much of Asia. Until now, fossils from the species known as Denisovan had been found in just one Siberian cave. The Denisovans are members of a mysterious lineage of Neanderthal-like humans that disappeared about 50,000 years ago. The Tibetan fossil, found by a Buddhist monk in the area pictured above, was a jawbone at least 160,000 years old, making it by far the oldest evidence of humans on the Tibetan plateau. Modern Tibetans have a special genetic inheritance from Denisovans that allows them to live at high elevations. _____ 9. And now for a stop in the most biodiverse desert in the world. Our writer drove through the Devil’s Highway, a 130-mile dirt road in the Sonoran Desert that carries sad reminders of its history. For centuries it has been notorious as a route along which people die. But El Camino del Diablo also offers mesmerizing views of the Arizona desert, and is home to more than 275 animal species and 400 types of plants. Want to try it? Our writer suggests bringing plenty of water and an adventurous spirit. _____ 10. Finally, a spy whale. Fishermen off the coast of Norway came across an unusual sight last week — a beluga whale with a strapped harness that had mounts for GoPro-type cameras. “St. Petersburg equipment” was embossed on the harness clips. Norwegian scientists said they believed the whale was trained by the Russian Navy. The use of marine animals for military use isn’t that unusual, explains our reporter, a former Navy officer. Dolphins, whales and sea lions have all been trained to carry out missions — limited to finding and marking things, then exiting the area. “There are no weaponized dolphins,” he writes. Have a whale of a night. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

2019,"With 737 Max, Boeing Wants to Win Back Trust. Many Are Skeptical.","A charm offensive by Boeing to persuade airlines, crews and passengers to rally behind its 737 Max plane is already running into resistance. The effort, which includes daily calls with carriers as well as meetings with pilots and flight attendants, is being hampered by a problem of the company’s own making. After a bungled response to two deadly crashes involving the jet, Boeing is facing credibility problems. When Boeing dispatched one of its top lobbyists, John Moloney, to the headquarters of the influential union representing flight attendants a couple of weeks ago, he arrived determined to win their support. He met a skeptical audience. “Reading your body language, you look cynical,” Mr. Moloney said, according to three people who were present and took notes during the discussion with the Association of Flight Attendants. “If this explanation doesn’t address your concerns, I’ll come back. I’ll bring a pilot.” Sara Nelson, the head of the union, told Mr. Moloney that she was rooting for Boeing, but wasn’t ready to tell flight attendants and travelers to fly on the Max. “I don’t know, sitting here right now, that I can tell you there’s complete confidence that everything’s been fixed at Boeing,” she told Mr. Moloney. The meeting, punctuated by contentious moments between the two sides, underscores how difficult it will be for Boeing to restore credibility with airlines and passengers. In recent weeks, the company’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, updated the heads of Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines — the three carriers in the United States that fly the Max — on progress. On Tuesday, Boeing held a meeting in Amsterdam for European airlines to discuss new training for the Max, plans for a public affairs campaign and how to get idled planes ready to fly again. Similar meetings will happen in Shanghai, Singapore, Moscow, Dubai and Miami in the coming weeks. Boeing, a juggernaut with deep ties in Washington and one of the country’s largest exporters, is on the defensive. The company is facing multiple federal investigations into design flaws that contributed to the accidents, along with a spate of lawsuits from the families of victims. Company executives and board members are deeply worried about the damage that has been done to Boeing’s once-sterling reputation. “Certainly there’s concern,” David Calhoun, the lead independent director of Boeing’s board, said in an interview. “There is recognition on all of our parts that we’re going to have to get out with restoring confidence in the Boeing brand broadly for years.” But there’s a limit to how much Boeing can say. “It’s an impossible situation because we’re not allowed to comment on anything related to these accidents,” Mr. Calhoun said. “There’s only one thing to do, and that’s to get a safe airplane back up in the sky,” he said. “I can’t message my way into it. Boeing can’t message its way into it.” [Claims of shoddy production draw scrutiny to a second Boeing jet] Boeing has been working furiously to get the Max flying again since its grounding in March. The company is preparing to submit a software fix in the coming weeks for American regulators to approve. It hosted hundreds of airline officials and pilots last month at the 737 Max factory in Renton, Wash. And it is in constant dialogue with regulators ahead of a meeting that the Federal Aviation Administration will host with global aviation authorities in Fort Worth on May 23. “Ultimately, the decision to return the Max to commercial service rests in the hands of global regulators,” Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman, said in a statement. Simultaneously, Boeing is shaping a public relations strategy to reach passengers. Although the final media plan is still in the works, Boeing will not be relying solely on its executives to win back the public’s trust — a recognition that its leadership has lost some good will. The company and airlines agree that the chief executive, Mr. Muilenburg, as the face of a company under intense scrutiny, may not be the most effective messenger. Instead, the initial plan calls for pilots to play a major role in the campaign. “We think a key voice in all of this will be the pilots for our airlines, and their voice is very important,” Mr. Muilenburg said on Boeing’s earnings call last month. “That bond between the passenger and the pilot is one that’s critical, and so we’re working with our airline customers and those pilot voices to ensure that we can build on that going forward.” Boeing has enlisted media agencies, including Edelman, to plan the strategy for reintroducing the Max, and is considering buying ads to promote the plane. Airline executives in the United States are eager for the Max to return to service and for Boeing to succeed. But many are privately frustrated with the company’s handling of the crisis, according to three people briefed on the matter. They believe that Boeing has badly mismanaged the public response to the crashes and are irked that the public relations blitz will fall to their pilots. Pilots, too, are reluctant to become brand ambassadors for Boeing, which barely interacted with them before the Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October, the first of the two deadly accidents. “Our response is, yeah, that’s cute, but we aren’t going to hop into bed with you,” said Mike Trevino, the spokesman for the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. “We are still going to maintain an independent voice and call it as we see it.” In part, the reluctance stems from Boeing’s mixed messaging. Despite having said, “We own it,” Mr. Muilenburg has not acknowledged that anything was wrong with the design of the 737 Max, saying that the design process followed standard procedures. “We clearly have areas where we need to improve, including transparency,” Mr. Johndroe, the Boeing spokesman, said in a statement. During the meeting last month, the flight attendants pushed Mr. Moloney to explain why the company didn’t inform pilots about the software that contributed to both crashes. He acknowledged that Boeing should have told them, but kept reiterating that pilots were expected to be able to handle the conditions on both doomed flights. Passenger groups have demanded that Boeing take more responsibility for the Max debacle. “If they really wanted to fix the problem, you would think they would admit that it’s their fault,” said Paul Hudson, the president of Flyers Rights, a nonprofit group advocating for passengers. “You can’t say, ‘Oh, we own it, but we didn’t do anything wrong and it’s someone else’s fault.’” Pilots and airlines say Boeing has also struggled to communicate with them about how basic systems on the Max work. After the crash in Indonesia, pilots criticized Boeing for not informing them about the new software, which automatically pushes down the nose of the plane when the system deems it necessary. They have also been concerned by revelations that Boeing provided incomplete information about features in the cockpit. This week, Boeing said it believed a key cockpit warning light was standard on all Max jets, but learned several months after beginning deliveries in 2017 that the light worked only if airlines had bought a separate feature, known as the angle of attack indicator. Southwest bought the plane without the indicator, on the assumption that the warning light was activated. It was only after the Lion Air accident that Boeing told regulators and some pilots that the light wasn’t functional. Boeing told United something else entirely, creating even more confusion over Boeing’s understanding, according to a person who took notes at the meeting. When United Airlines ordered 100 Max jets in 2017, Boeing told United that the alert and the angle of attack indicator came as a package deal. United declined the options at the time. “Every day it seems like a new set of questions pops up,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the union representing American Airlines pilots. “I’m not here to be your arm candy. I’m here to know about the airplane.” Toward the end of the meeting with the flight attendants, Mr. Moloney made a last-ditch effort to win them over. “We want you to be able to tell your members this plane is safe to fly,” Mr. Moloney said, according to the three people in attendance. “Whatever it takes.” Ms. Nelson, the union’s leader, rattled off a list of things she needed from Boeing before agreeing. One was a letter from engineers working on the software update, saying they felt confident in the fix. Another was a full-throated apology from Boeing. Mr. Moloney promised to follow up. “We think that Boeing’s credibility directly relates to the credibility of U.S. aviation,” Ms. Nelson told him. “It’s important to us that the credibility and the leadership of U.S. aviation is maintained around the world.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Durant Hurt, the Warriors Dynasty Could Suddenly Be Reeling","On Pro Basketball There will be at least one more Golden State Warriors game at the concrete relic known as Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif. That is suddenly as declarative as we can be about the team that has come closest to a sure thing in basketball over the past half-decade. For the dynastic Golden State Warriors — even after their three championships in the past four seasons — there can be no further promises after the Kevin Durant injury scare that shook the N.B.A. late Wednesday night. In its latest series of attrition with the Houston Rockets, this time it’s indeed Golden State that has seized a three-games-to-two lead — with the knowledge that a Game 7, if necessary, will be on the Warriors’ floor. Yet it’s also the Warriors, just like Houston after losing Chris Paul in the same spot last season, who will chase that hard-to-get, clinching fourth victory without one of their most important players. Correction: As described by his teammate Klay Thompson after the Warriors’ 104-99 Game 5 win, Durant is Golden State’s “best player.” Durant was fortunate to come away with a mere calf strain late in the third quarter, when the noncontact injury he suffered after a baseline jumper over Houston’s Iman Shumpert sparked immediate fears, even on Durant’s bench, that he had just suffered an Achilles’ tear that would sideline him for months. “That looked like it was way worse than a calf strain,” Golden State’s Draymond Green said at a postgame news conference. The reality, though, is that Durant is likely to be out for the rest of this playoff series even though an M.R.I. exam on Thursday, according to the team, confirmed the Warriors’ initial diagnosis that he had sustained only a mild calf strain. He will not travel with the team to Houston for Game 6, and he is scheduled to be re-evaluated next week. Durant, who entered Game 5 averaging 45 minutes a game for the series, suffered a calf injury in his left leg during the Warriors’ first-round series with Portland in the 2017 playoffs and missed two games. That would figure to be the optimist’s minimum in this case — especially given Durant’s own worrisome reaction when he initially felt the pain. “Scary” was the word Golden State’s Stephen Curry used. “The way you saw him get hurt on the floor, the uncertainty of him walking to the locker room, the first thought is Achilles, things like that,” Curry said. “Thankfully it wasn’t that.” Wednesday’s score was 68-65 in Golden State’s favor when Durant exited. The Warriors had squandered all of a 20-point lead by that stage, but obviously have enough firepower and playoff know-how to gird themselves for grinding through a pivotal quarter and change sans Durant to pull out one narrow victory. Even against their most formidable foe. But navigating a start-to-finish Game 6 at Houston on Friday night without Durant, or Sunday afternoon’s potential Game 7 back at Oracle, will naturally be a lot tougher than coping or even thriving for a short spell — and the two-time defending champions know it. “We wish him a speedy recovery,” Thompson said, “because we’re not the same team without him.” The Warriors began this highly anticipated rematch of last season’s epic Western Conference finals short-handed in a big way after losing the rugged center DeMarcus Cousins to a quadriceps tear in just Cousins’s second career playoff game, against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. Houston’s physicality has caused Golden State countless problems, and Cousins’s brutish game would have been a handy counter for Warriors Coach Steve Kerr to punish the Rockets’ switching defenses and small lineups. Cousins’s absence and Golden State’s otherwise thin bench prompted Kerr to shift Green to center at the start of the series and move his trusted veteran swingman Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup for the first time all season. The move undoubtedly helped stake the Warriors to a vital 2-0 series lead, but the minutes being logged by Green and the 35-year-old Iguodala — and, frankly, Durant as well — have been a concern throughout. In Game 5, Iguodala played 33 minutes on a banged-up left knee, and Durant just joined Cousins on the list of unavailables. The Warriors, who aren’t nearly as deep as they were when this run of championship contention began during the 2014-15 season, will soon find out if they have enough to buy Durant more recovery time — or if Houston can launch the whole Golden State franchise into a murky off-season, headlined by the looming free agencies of Durant and Thompson, earlier than anyone expected. The Warriors got by Wednesday night thanks to Thompson (27 points after two rough games in Houston), Green (8 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists), Kevon Looney (five of Golden State’s nine offensive rebounds) and, of course, Curry. Golden State’s 31-17 lead after one quarter — achieved without a single point from Curry — predictably didn’t last. But the sharpshooting Curry finally broke out of his series-long perimeter funk to make five of his first six shots after Durant’s departure, good for 14 of Curry’s 25 points. “It was a breakthrough for sure,” Curry said. It certainly didn’t hurt the hosts that Paul shot 3 for 14 from the field — or that Houston’s James Harden (31 points) managed just one shot attempt over the game’s final 8 minutes 30 seconds. The Rockets, though, are bound to bounce back with vigor once the full scope of their opportunity to slay the mighty (but compromised) Warriors sets in. It’s an immediate chance to atone for what they squandered a year ago, when Houston built double-digit leads in both Game 6 and Game 7 but couldn’t hold either without Paul. This is already just the fourth playoff series in league history in which each of the first five games were decided by 6 points or fewer. The Warriors have outscored the Rockets by a mere six points over all in the five games so far. “We know we’re going to have to be near-perfect to go down to Houston without a Kevin and win a game,” Thompson said. Kerr insisted afterward that he had been assured by the Warriors’ medical staff that Durant’s injury was “not the Achilles.” No need, then, to commence with the breathless (and largely futile) speculation about how the setback potentially affects Durant’s free agency in July and the rival teams such as the Knicks, Nets and Los Angeles Clippers who have been planning to aggressively court him starting July 1. Focusing on the mere playoff impact of Durant’s newly uncertain status is grave enough. He’s averaging 35.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists in these playoffs, while shooting 51.8 percent from the floor and 42.9 percent from the 3-point line. With LeBron James missing from the N.B.A. postseason for the first time since 2005, it’s Durant who has emerged as the most feared singular force on the planet. Can the Warriors beat the Rockets one more time without him? How much of the conference finals would Durant have to miss if Golden State manages to advance? Is this — missing two starters through injury — how the Warriors’ dynastic runs ends before next season’s move from Oracle to the Chase Center in San Francisco? Those, for now, are far more pertinent questions than anything July-related. And the Warriors, sure things no more, are as eager to learn the answers as anyone. “We got to have his back the way he’s been, honestly, carrying us the entire playoff run,” Curry said of Durant.",The New York Times
2019,"With Frantic Stretch Looming, Mets Try to Regroup","After two wins and a rainout against the last-place Miami Marlins at Citi Field over the weekend, Mets Manager Mickey Callaway on Sunday acknowledged he was not out of the storm yet as his team prepared for a six-game road trip. “We’ve been disappointed in the way we’ve played,” he said. “We need to play better.” For the middling Mets, who are now 19-20, frustration had built up as they went 1-5 during their previous road trip through San Diego and Milwaukee. Upon returning to Queens on Friday, Callaway met with General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen and the co-owner Jeff Wilpon before players reported to the stadium to discuss how to get the team back on track. On the field, the Mets responded immediately with an impressive 11-2 victory over Miami, but Callaway knew management’s message was not just about a single weekend. “I’m not trying to rain on the parade, but it’s one game,” Callaway said. “We have to continue to focus.” The Mets will get another opportunity to reset as they visit the Washington Nationals beginning Tuesday. Neither team has taken off in the National League East after expressing an expectation to win now. The Nationals are 16-24 and in fourth place, three and a half games behind the third-place Mets. If the Mets do not right themselves quickly, they know that it will be a long time before they get another breather. Following Monday’s off day, the Mets have a stretch of 20 games in 20 days that will take them to Washington and Miami before button-hooking back to New York and then to Los Angeles and Arizona. “We’ve got to keep it going,” Callaway said. “We’re better than we’ve shown.” The problem is not so much that they haven’t shown it, but that they’ve only shown it on one side of the ball at a time: When the Mets have hit, the pitching has been subpar, and vice versa. But in beating the Marlins, the Mets relied on a grand slam by shortstop Amed Rosario one night and the all-around talents of Jacob deGrom, the National League’s reigning Cy Young Award winner, the next. DeGrom provided support for himself, as well: In addition to allowing one run over seven innings, he posted two hits and drove in a run to win, 4-1. He recognized the need to rebound quickly. “We had a rough road trip, and we’re out there battling every day trying to win baseball games,” said deGrom, who improved to 3-4. “We weren’t able to do it on the road, so to come out and take two early in a short home stand is a big plus for us.” DeGrom’s return to normalcy over his last three outings has been a huge encouragement for the Mets. He has surrendered a total of three runs in that span, and his E.R.A. is down to 3.26 after a stretch in which he went 0-3 with a 9.69 E.R.A. “I had a couple of bad ones in a row, but I wasn’t too worried,” deGrom said. The Mets’ arms remain the roster’s strength, but there are issues they hope will be sorted out sooner rather than later. Noah Syndergaard will start the series against the Nationals, but he will be followed by Wilmer Font, the pitcher the Mets acquired in a trade with the Tampa Bay Rays last week. The left-hander Steven Matz was scheduled to throw a bullpen session Sunday morning, but he remains under close watch with a nerve issue. Jason Vargas, the fifth starter, is on the mend with a hamstring injury after starting to string together solid starts. Even with the interruptions, the pitchers have started performing more efficiently and aggressively. “It has stabilized for sure,” Callaway said of his rotation’s performance. “This is the way these guys are capable of throwing.” The bullpen is also in flux. Reliever Jeurys Familia is scheduled to rejoin the active roster after battling shoulder inflammation. He had struggled to find a rhythm as the setup man before being placed on the injured list. In his previous 10 appearances, he allowed 11 walks over 10⅔ innings while posting an 8.44 E.R.A. In his place, relievers Robert Gsellman and Seth Lugo have excelled, and Callaway allowed that he would be selective in deploying Familia. “It’s not that we don’t feel confident in him at that point,” Callaway said. “We do feel like there’s going to have to be a little bit of an easing him back in to fit back where he should in the bullpen.” Callaway knows he can only be so patient. After his lengthy meeting with Van Wagenen and Wilpon, he was asked if he felt added pressure moving forward. “No, not at all,” he said. “I already felt that way.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Higher Tariffs, China Retaliates Against the U.S.","BEIJING — China moved to retaliate against the United States, announcing plans on Monday to raise tariffs on American goods ranging from beer and wine to swimsuits, shirts and liquefied natural gas. The decision, which follows President Trump’s increase in tariffs on Chinese goods last Friday, escalates the pressure in the ongoing trade war. Trade talks between the two sides broke down last week without a deal, causing tensions that have rippled through financial markets and the global economy. American stocks plunged on Monday, extending the recent losses. Beijing’s retaliation comes at a time when many in China feel that the United States has behaved highhandedly in threatening tariffs. “Mutual trust and respect are of the essence in handling the negotiations,” said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economics professor. It isn’t clear whether China’s retaliation would end with the tariff increases. In the past, China has slowed imports at customs and launched investigations into foreign companies during times of tension. [Read more on how both the United States and China left a window for negotiators to try to reach a deal before their economies are hit by the higher tariffs. But it is unclear whether the two sides can quickly resolve what has once again become a heated economic dispute.] Hu Xijin, editor of the Global Times, a tabloid owned by the Chinese Communist Party, tweeted on Monday evening that he was expecting broader retaliation, including halting purchases of American agricultural and energy products, reducing orders for Boeing aircraft and possibly even the sale of part of China’s large holdings of Treasuries. The last of these threats once unnerved markets but has since lost some of its edge. China has been diversifying for the past decade where it parks its money, and had to spend a quarter of its huge hoard of foreign currency reserves three years ago to stem a decline in its currency. China’s finance ministry announced on Monday evening that it was raising tariffs on a wide range of American goods to 20 percent or 25 percent from 10 percent. But the ministry delayed implementation until June 1. The delay will allow time for negotiators to make one last push for a deal. It roughly matches a delay that the Trump administration put on its own tariff increase. President Trump on Friday raised tariffs on $200 billion a year worth of Chinese goods, particularly auto parts, to 25 percent from 10 percent. He had already imposed 25 percent tariffs last summer on another $50 billion a year of Chinese goods, including a wide range of products that his administration views as strategic, from cars to aircraft parts and nuclear reactor components. The Trump administration has more tariffs planned. The Office of the United States Trade Representative has said that on Monday, it will issue for public comment at Mr. Trump’s direction a proposal to raise tariffs on “essentially all remaining imports from China, which are valued at approximately $300 billion.” Because China’s entire imports from the United States are considerably less than $200 billion, it has not had the option of matching the United States dollar for dollar. Last September, China had matched President Trump’s 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion a year in goods with its own tariffs of 5 percent to 10 percent on $60 billion a year in American goods. On Monday, China’s ministry of finance raised those tariffs by introducing four new categories for the $60 billion in goods. The tariffs on those four categories are 25 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent and 5 percent. The finance ministry did not specify the dollar value of goods in each of the four categories. But the largest number of tariff codes in the $60 billion was assigned to the 25 percent category, suggesting that China was raising the tariffs on many imports to that level. China’s tariff increases on Monday included raising the tariff on liquefied natural gas imports from the United States to 25 percent from 10 percent. That could hurt Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, three states with a lot of Trump supporters. By contrast, China left unchanged at 5 percent its tariffs on about a tenth of the product categories in the $60 billion. These included its tariffs on imports of American tires, light bulbs and certain paper products. Neither the American tariffs nor China’s retaliation will go into effect right away. Despite the rising tensions, the Trump administration structured its tariff increase on Friday so that it won’t take effect for a few weeks, giving both sides a bit more room to reach a deal. In a departure from the usual practice of assessing tariffs on goods based on the date when they reach American seaports and airports, the Trump administration declared that the increased tariffs on $200 billion a year in goods would be applied only to shipments that left China from Friday onward. Goods that travel by sea take two to four weeks to reach the United States from China, depending mainly on whether the ship sails to the East or West Coast and how fast the ship travels. That means the effect won’t be felt for a few weeks except for the small share of goods moving by air. Chris Rogers, a trade analyst at Panjiva, a trade data firm, said that roughly 90 percent of all American imports from China come by sea, and the rest by air. An even higher proportion of the $200 billion in goods being hit by the latest tariff increase is likely to come by sea, he said, because the higher tariffs do not cover big categories like iPhones that come to the United States almost entirely by air. There is also a practical reason for the Trump administration not to have imposed the tariff increase right away: Updating customs procedures can be slow. The Trump administration “wanted to start the clock but be realistic about implementation,” said James Green, the top trade official at the United States embassy in Beijing until August and now a senior adviser at McLarty Associates, a Washington consulting firm. The question now is whether another round of tit-for-tat tariff increases portends an economic struggle between the United States and China that could last for many years. Since President Trump was elected, the two sides have repeatedly seemed close to a deal only for it to fall apart. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross seemed to have the outlines of a deal in 2017. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked of a deal being at hand a year ago. President Trump himself was upbeat about the prospects for a deal last month. Chinese officials have been consistently encouraging about progress toward a deal for the past two years, even though a hardening of China’s stance last week appears to have contributed to Mr. Trump’s decision this week to raise tariffs. Last week’s round of talks in Washington is the 11th time that senior Chinese and American officials have met to discuss trade since President Trump took office. “What should be concerning to markets is how close both sides have gotten to a deal before one side backs off,” something that has happened again and again, said Hannah Anderson, a global markets strategist in the Hong Kong office of J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Global markets fell on Monday, and the renminbi, China’s currency, also fell half a percent against the dollar. Goldman Sachs revised its forecast for the currency’s value, to 6.95 to the dollar three months from now, instead of the 6.65 it had been expecting. Falls in the Chinese currency make Chinese goods more competitive in foreign markets, including Europe’s as well as the United States. But a weakening renminbi also creates an incentive for Chinese companies and households to try to evade China’s controls on international money movements and shift large sums out of the country, which could undermine the stability of China’s financial system.",The New York Times
2019,"With His Job Gone, an Autoworker Wonders, ‘What Am I as a Man?’","Rick Marsh worked in the car plant in Lordstown his entire life. Now that job is gone. What does that mean for his politics? Rick Marsh outside the Union Hall in Lordstown, Ohio.CreditCreditMaddie McGarvey for The New York Times LORDSTOWN, Ohio — In the weeks since he lost his job at the car plant, Rick Marsh has blasted Pink Floyd while cleaning the house. He has watched the cat watching the birds. He has smoked cigarettes out the sliding glass door. He has watched Motor Trend, a TV network about cars. He bought a grill and built a swing set. He has done everything he could to avoid thinking about the fact that, after 25 years at the General Motors plant in Lordstown, he was losing the only real job he ever had. For Mr. Marsh the plant is personal, but in the three months since G.M. stopped making cars there, it has become political. A parade of presidential hopefuls has come through, using the plant to make the point that American capitalism no longer works for ordinary people. President Trump has taken an interest too, berating both G.M. and the union on Twitter, and then suddenly announcing brightly in early May that the plant would be sold to a small company that few people in Lordstown had ever heard of. The news caused a stir. TV trucks showed up at the union hall. But after a few days it became clear to Mr. Marsh that the buyer — which had no experience in mass vehicle production and quarterly revenues that were less than the price of one high-end sports car — was probably not a solution. [Savior of G.M. Lordstown plant, hailed by Trump, is a corporate cipher] “To me, it’s another flagrant sign that these people, they really don’t have a clue,” Mr. Marsh said of the country’s political class. “They are so out of touch with reality and real people. All of them.” He made no exception for Mr. Trump. Mr. Marsh voted for him, as did a majority of voters in Trumbull County, a small square on the map of northeast Ohio that hadn’t voted for a Republican for president since 1972. The path to the White House next year runs through places like Lordstown, and Mr. Marsh and many of his neighbors, far from knowing how they will vote, say the G.M. plant shutdown has only left them more at sea politically. They tried voting for Barack Obama, then Mr. Trump. Now they don’t know where to turn. Jeremy Ladd, a Lordstown plant worker now taking classes to get into nursing school, said that most workers were still coming to terms with what had happened, and that for many, the politics were an open question whose answer would unfold over time. “People are trying to make sense of this politically,” he said. “It’s like a free radical bouncing around.” transcript Shawn Wodogaza, a Lordstown plant worker who voted for Mr. Trump reluctantly, said he felt politically lost now. “I don’t know where to go,” he said. “It seems like no matter what he does or tries to do, it doesn’t work out,” he said of the president. “Well, now what? What the heck do we do? Do we go back to beating our heads against the wall? Or do we try something different?” Mr. Marsh, too, is still making up his mind. For three generations of Marsh men, the G.M. plant was a golden ticket to a middle-class life in a part of the country where those were not easy to come by. Then, when Rick Marsh got the biggest test of his life — the birth of his beloved daughter, Abigail, and her diagnosis of cerebral palsy at the age of one — his job became a central part of how he saw himself. He was her provider, her protector. That was his worth in the world. So when the last car rolled off the Lordstown assembly line around 2:45 p.m. on Wednesday, March 6, it was like a heart stopping. He had lost the thing that made him who he was. He knows he is looking for one thing from the country’s political system: a president who will save the plant that has meant everything to his family. “I really don’t care if it’s a Democrat, Republican, male, female, black, white, I don’t care,” he said. This wasn’t supposed to happen. Mr. Marsh thought he would retire from the Lordstown plant, just like his father. Richard Marsh Sr. started in 1967, the year after the plant opened. He came straight out of the Army, inspecting headlights for $1.92 an hour. When he got his first paycheck, $100, “I thought I was rich,” the elder Marsh said. The job lifted the Marsh family from apartment to trailer to house on a pretty street lined with cornfields and long, smooth driveways. Rick grew up there, in a back bedroom with heavy-metal posters on the walls. His grades weren’t good, but he wasn’t worried. When a history teacher told him he’d be stuck flipping burgers for the rest of his life, Rick told him he knew where he’d be working. When his father — at the time an elected union official — got him a job at the plant, it came with two pieces of advice. “Get to work on time, and don’t embarrass me,” the younger Marsh recalled his father saying. That was 1993, and the plant was its own little city. It employed around 9,000 people. Its giant parking lot was packed. Workers grilled sausages in the break room. He grew up with his colleagues, going to bars, attending weddings, coaching their children in softball, taking up collections when someone’s parent died. The truth was, he never really liked the work. He found it boring and physically demanding. He worked in the paint shop, wearing two sets of gloves, big plastic boots and a full body apron, while he wielded a sanding tool that smoothed the primer on the surface of the cars. Every night he came home drenched and exhausted. But he was grateful for it. With his G.M. paychecks, he built a big house in the woods just half a mile from his parents. He paid for his wedding in full and bought his new wife, Lindsay Marsh, a blue Chevy TrailBlazer. And when Abby came along — his beautiful girl, his floppy baby — his financial security powered the family through the six years of therapy it took to teach her how to walk. In those early years, Mr. Marsh didn’t care about politics. He voted for Democrats without really thinking about it. It was what his family had always done, more out of union loyalty than ideology. But he started to pay attention in the late 1990s, after the United States struck a trade deal with Mexico. When he asked his father about Nafta, the elder Marsh fumed that it would destroy manufacturing. He remembers his father calling him shortly after he picked up his new 1999 two-door Chevy Tahoe, shouting at him to return it. “I said, ‘What do you mean, take it back?’” Rick Marsh said. “He said, ‘It’s made in Mexico.’” The younger Marsh could not believe a G.M. truck would be made in Mexico, and he told his father so. “He said ‘I’m telling you, I’m in the union right now. Just take it back.’” He eventually traded it in, miserably, for a Chevy Impala. “That was the first I’d ever heard of our cars being made somewhere else and sold here,” he said. At some point, change sped up, like an invisible hand moving behind him, erasing things. Automation accelerated. In Mr. Marsh’s area of the paint shop, nicknamed Cripple Creek, someone had written on the wall how many workers there were each year. In 1970 it was 38. By the time he left in the early 2000s, it was four. He was sent to Oklahoma to learn how a plant’s paint shop was set up. A few years later, the whole plant was shut down. He ticked off others that closed: Detroit, Delaware, Janesville, Shreveport. “It’s literally in your face — the decline of manufacturing,” he said. “You can work where I work and watch it.” Nafta had given him a new political awareness: Republicans may have started it, but it was Democrats who sealed the deal. “That’s when I realized these parties were not so different,” he said. “They are all there to make money on our backs.” Still, he kept voting for Democrats, including twice for Barack Obama. He gives him credit for the bailout of G.M. The company would have died without that help. But it made him angry that a financial crisis that started with banks ended with autoworkers giving up raises and the right to strike, which seemed to him the only real leverage they still had. (They got it back later.) Mr. Marsh had never had a definitive moment with politics, a sudden clarity in which he clicked with a candidate. That changed in 2016. He remembers sitting at home watching a debate between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton. He was expecting suit-and-tie civility. Instead, he got a circus. Mr. Trump was like a boxer who kept landing punches. It was electrifying. “I said, ‘Wow, I’ve never seen anything like this,’” he said. He knew what it looked like. Mr. Trump was kind of crazy. But he liked the fact that he didn’t back down. Then Mr. Trump brought up Nafta, and it was like he was speaking directly to Mr. Marsh. Nothing else mattered — not Russia, not porn stars, not divorces. “Nobody had our backs in office, not Democrats or Republicans,” he said. “I’m tired of being sugarcoated and being robbed in the process.” He voted for Mr. Trump, and so did his father, along with just under half the workers represented by the union. He was in the plant on election night. He remembers being in the break room with the TV off, and a woman came in crying. Trump had pulled ahead. The reaction would intensify over the following months. He found it baffling. The only explanation he could think of was generational: millennials freaking out after not getting their way. The end began the day after Mr. Trump’s election. On Nov. 9, 2016, G.M. announced it was cutting its third shift — an evening crew of about 1,200 people, about one-quarter of the plant’s total work force. Then some months later, a daytime shift was let go, including Mr. Marsh’s nephew, who got the layoff notice on the same day that he received a certificate congratulating him on 10 years at the plant. The final cut came last year, a few days after Thanksgiving. Now Mr. Marsh faces a choice. He can stay in Lordstown for as long as there is a chance the plant might restart production; its fate will be decided in negotiations between the company and the union this summer. If it does close for good, he can hope his seniority will be enough to land a job at another G.M. plant. Or he could transfer to another G.M. plant sooner, but he hates that idea. His biggest worry is for his daughter, Abby, now 14. He and his wife have spent years fighting to get her services in Ohio, aides in school and coverage under Medicaid. Moving would be wrenching. Hundreds of workers have already transferred. His nephew packed up his family and moved to Flint. The alternative, working on natural gas wells in Pennsylvania, paid him $13 an hour, about half what he was making at G.M. G.M. is a lifeline for Mr. Marsh, too. It will pay him a pension, a rare thing in today’s economy. He may have given up raises, but he gets a share of the company’s profits — last year, about $10,000. Under the union contract, he gets payments to supplement his unemployment check, and his family still has health insurance — unlike his brother-in-law, who worked at a company that made the seats for the cars. Going against G.M., he said, “is like rooting for the pilot of my own plane to go down.” At the same time, he feels angry that a company can just do this — blow out of town after highway exit ramps were built for it and the government bailed it out, and meanwhile announce that the new Chevy Blazer will be made in Mexico. What has happened with the plant has made him see things differently. He never used to care that G.M.’s chief executive, Mary Barra, made millions of dollars every year. Now he thinks about it. Companies have more and more power. It makes him feel small. Like the time they were told they’d be laid off, and everybody just went right back to work. “It felt like we were begging,” he said. “It’s humiliating, as a man, as a person, as a worker.” He understands this to be a political problem. But what is the solution? He doesn’t blame Mr. Trump for the problems at the plant. They are older and bigger than him. Yes, he made promises during the campaign, telling people not to sell their houses because factory jobs were coming back. But politicians make promises. That’s what they do. The real question is whether anything is changing, and so far the answer is no. And he finds that Mr. Trump is “getting harder and harder to defend.” “He repealed Nafta and tried to replace it,” he said. “Am I happy with the result? No. Mexico is still killing us.” Then there was an unfortunate tweet storm from the president about the plant this spring, criticizing Mr. Marsh’s union leaders. “The leader of the free world has no idea how unions work,” he said. “He might understand business, but he doesn’t understand our business.” When Mr. Trump tweeted about the prospective sale of the plant earlier this month, Mr. Marsh was at home preparing for his wife’s birthday. Cheering the deal might check a political box for the president, but getting hired by the buyer would probably mean making $11 an hour, he said, a wage he last made in his early 20s. “It would be back to square one after 25 years in the plant,” he said. The presidential election is still many months away, and he hasn’t started paying attention to any of the candidates. But he plans to watch the debates carefully to see whether any political leader in America understands his family’s story. The answer has never felt more important. “People are going to get hungry, and when I mean hungry, I don’t mean just for food,” he said. “I think, once you get pushed to a point that you have nothing left,” he said, and paused. “Without the ability to feed my family and pay for my children and feed my children, what am I as a man?” Alyse Shorland contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,"With Insurance Bill Passage, House Democrats Begin Health Care Blitz","WASHINGTON — Returning to a central issue of the 2018 campaign, House Democrats on Thursday passed legislation to reverse Trump administration rules that allow expansion of health care plans that do not have to comply with the Affordable Care Act’s mandated coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. The vote — 230 to 183 — was a jab at President Trump, who has pressed for ways around the coverage mandates of President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement while claiming he is committed to protecting Americans with chronic illnesses. But it served a larger political purpose, kicking off a push by House Democrats on health care, an issue they see as central to winning back the White House and holding their gains in the House in 2020. Over the next two weeks, Democrats expect to pass a raft of legislation to drum home the point that, even as they clash with the White House over the findings of the Mueller report, they will continue to focus on proposals that help real people. The House bill would roll back an October 2018 regulation by the Treasury Department and the Department of Health and Human Services that expanded the eligibility of states to receive waivers to the Affordable Care Act to “increase coverage options” — particularly with insurance plans that offer more limited coverage than those compliant with coverage mandates under the 2010 health law. Another Democratic bill, due for a vote next week, would eliminate a Trump administration rule change that expanded the time limit for so-called limited-duration insurance plans to as long as three years from three months — plans Democrats call “junk insurance.” In all, a dozen health care bills are scheduled for votes over the next two weeks, a blitz intended to establish the House Democrats’ record on health care heading into next year’s election — and possibly divide congressional Republicans, who have maintained that they too want to preserve protections for people with pre-existing health conditions or chronic ailments. Other measures include a restoration of funding used to help consumers find and sign up for coverage under the health law, new disclosure requirements for prescription drug rebate programs, several measures intended to reduce drug costs and increase access to advanced medications known as biologics, and the allocation of $10 billion per year in new “reinsurance” payments that would help lower health care premiums by offsetting the costs of the most expensive insurance claims. Taken in total, the package is intended to build on the system established by the health law without disrupting the health care system for Americans who get coverage through work or a government program. It also represents a core component of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s policy agenda at a time when she has rebuffed calls to embrace more sweeping proposals, including the single-payer “Medicare for all” plan supported by many party liberals, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Ms. Pelosi is adopting a more measured approach. Some bills, like the pre-existing conditions package, are aimed at forcing Republicans into taking tough votes on health care. Others, like the drug bills, are expected to draw some Republican support — and could even win the support of Mr. Trump, who has said he wants to tackle the cost of prescription medications. “Every speech by Republicans in 2018 stated that they wanted to protect patients with pre-existing conditions, even as they were maligning the A.C.A.,” said Representative Ann McLane Kuster, Democrat of New Hampshire, who introduced Thursday’s bill. “I think, symbolically, this bill is the one that frames the rest of the issues, and our focus on expanding health care,” she said. “It’s also about pushing back on this administration’s attempts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act at every step along the way.” The short-term plans targeted by Democrats were initially intended as stopgaps for people who had gaps their coverage, not as long-term sources of coverage. In the past two years, they have become one of the administration’s main avenues of attack on the health law. Mr. Trump has said he is merely trying to lower insurance costs for people who want to take the risk of not having the comprehensive coverage mandated by the health law. As of yet, however, no states have applied for the waivers targeted by Ms. Kuster’s bill, and several states have reinstated the three-month limits the Trump administration hoped to extend. Still, the rule changes are seen as a major threat to the survival of the health law; as many as 1.6 million health care consumers could opt out of the law’s regulated marketplace by 2022, according to officials with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Rolling back these rules — and restoring the existing system under the health law — would save taxpayers an estimated $8.9 billion over the next decade, realized by keeping relatively healthy people, who draw fewer benefits in the coverage pool, from leaving the federally subsidized system, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Ms. Kuster’s bill, which four Republicans crossed party lines to support, has virtually no chance of passing in the Senate. The White House budget office defended the granting of state waivers this week, arguing that the rule changes have not resulted in the loss of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. “The president has repeatedly made clear that this administration will protect people with pre-existing conditions,” a statement from the office said. “Coverage in the individual market has become increasingly unaffordable for unsubsidized consumers, including those with pre-existing conditions. The 2018 guidance freed states to develop health coverage that best fits the needs of their residents.” Supporters of the bill say that the rule changes are a thinly veiled attempt to weaken the health law’s online insurance exchanges by enticing younger, healthier patients to withdraw — making them financially unsustainable. “The people who enroll in short-term plans often wind up not getting the insurance they were counting on, even though they seem superficially attractive for younger people because the premiums are lower than Obamacare,” said Stan Dorn, a health policy analyst with Families USA, a liberal health care advocacy group that has strongly supported the health law. “It’s also devastating to the system to pull these young and healthy people out, because the premiums rise for everybody else,” he added. Mr. Trump, frustrated in his attempts to repeal the health law in Congress, has tried to attack it piecemeal, by loosening regulations that govern insurance plans and by granting waivers to states that weaken the complex system of exchanges and subsidies needed to make it function. This month, the administration formally declared its opposition to the entire Affordable Care Act, arguing in a federal appeals court filing in Texas that the system — which covers about 23 million low-income and working-class Americans — should be scrapped. Democrats are hoping to cast doubt on Mr. Trump’s vow to “always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions” — but they are also hoping the push will mute the differences in their own party. On Wednesday, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, played down divisions between Ms. Pelosi and liberals who are pushing for a vote on the Medicate for All Act. “Speaker Pelosi and I have both maintained that the best way for us to get there — and we want to get there — is to make sure that the A.C.A. is working as it was intended to work,” he told reporters during his weekly pen-and-pad session.",The New York Times
2019,"With Joko Widodo’s Re-election, Indonesia Bucks Global Tilt Toward Strongmen","MANDALIKA, Indonesia — The woman threw herself on the road in front of the motorcade, forcing the vehicle with the license plate “Indonesia 1” to slam on the brakes. “Jokowi, I love you,” she cried, as President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, re-elected with the release of Tuesday’s vote count, rolled down his window to clasp hands with the sobbing fan on a rural roadside on the island of Lombok. Commonly known by the nickname Jokowi, Mr. Joko seems an unlikely figure to command such rock-star reverence. His oratory depends less on grand vision or populist rhetoric and more on statistics about road building or village financing down to the 10th decimal place. He favors plain white collared shirts and black trousers. He speaks softly. Yet Mr. Joko’s re-election to a second and final term as president of the world’s fourth most populous nation is a powerful counterweight to the democratic weakening and strongman politics that have recently dominated the global electoral landscape. “I’m president of all of Indonesia, and democracy protects pluralism,” Mr. Joko told The New York Times in an interview. “My government is about harmony and opposing extremism.” Just by the numbers, of which Mr. Joko is so fond, Indonesia is a nation of political superlatives. The country has the world’s largest Muslim population, but it is also a secular state with sizable religious minorities. It is the planet’s third-biggest democracy, behind India and the United States. And it is the biggest island nation on earth, composed of 17,000 islands where more than 300 languages are spoken, according to the president’s count. “For the continued existence of our country,” Mr. Joko said, “we have to rely on Indonesia’s culture, which is diverse and tolerant.” Yet the challenges of holding together such a sprawling nation mean that Indonesia often seems to retreat into itself rather than project its weight on the global stage. Mr. Joko, 57, demurred when asked whether Indonesia, which overthrew a dictatorship two decades ago, might serve as a model for Muslim-majority nations ruled by family diktat. “Islam and democracy are compatible,” Mr. Joko said. “But let others come and see with their own eyes. I cannot tell them.” Instead, he began listing the finer points of cutting red tape to acquire business permits. Focusing on a lagging infrastructure that has hobbled the nation’s economic growth, he spent nearly 10 minutes talking about the more than 1,100 miles of new roads built during his first five-year term. Then he moved on to the merits of mass transit. The country’s traffic-choked capital, Jakarta, struggled for years to build a subway, its first part opening only recently. “Transportation maybe is not sexy,” he said. “But if we don’t have good infrastructure, we cannot be a developed country. We are behind in building roads and airports.” [Jakarta is sinking so fast, it could end up underwater.] A onetime furniture maker before becoming a mayor, Mr. Joko is the first true commoner to be elected president of Indonesia. He took power in 2014, promising to uphold the rights of minorities and women. In addition to improving Indonesia’s woeful infrastructure, he pledged to combat deep-rooted corruption. “I’ve been working on public works for 40 years,” said Basuki Hadimuljono, the minister for public works and people’s housing. “This is the first time we’ve had commitment from the president to do all this.” Mr. Joko’s opponent in last month’s elections, Prabowo Subianto, was the same old-guard opponent he faced in 2014. A former army general who was once married to the daughter of Indonesia’s longtime dictator, Mr. Prabowo said on Tuesday that he would challenge the election results. Despite his taste for wine and a Christian mother, Mr. Prabowo aligned himself with hard-line Muslim forces that have called for the country to jettison its syncretic Islam for a more austere form of the faith as practiced in its Middle Eastern birthplace. He allowed rumors to flourish that Mr. Joko, who fasts twice a week in a pious Muslim tradition, was a closet Christian. Mr. Joko has defended Indonesian Muslim traditions, which incorporate elements from other faiths, including local nature worship. As president, he banned a hard-line group intent on creating a global Islamic caliphate to replace democratic governance. “Our Islam is modern, moderate and different from others,” he said. But as Indonesia has hewed to a global trend of growing Islamic conservatism, Mr. Joko picked as his running mate this election a Muslim cleric who has spoken out against yoga and gay rights. When his former political protégé, an ethnic Chinese Christian, was imprisoned for blasphemy in 2017, a charge that human rights activists saw as politically motivated, Mr. Joko declined to defend him. Asked about his failure to speak up for his old political ally, Mr. Joko said after a long pause, “Sometimes in politics, it’s difficult to say,” adding, “You must decide the priorities for the country.” Mr. Joko’s critics say his silence betrayed the religious minorities who overwhelmingly voted for him in both presidential elections. “I thought that Jokowi missed the golden moment to strengthen the human rights regime that has been enshrined in the Constitution and other human rights laws,” said Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, a human rights lawyer and women’s rights advocate. Mr. Joko’s supporters say that his second term will allow him to pursue a reformist agenda without having to worry about re-election because of term limits. And in a country where political elites are often dogged by whispers of lavish corruption, Mr. Joko’s family is ascetic. One of his sons is a blogger who dabbles in a business of treats made of banana, while the other owns a pancake chain. His daughter failed to pass the civil service exam. Mr. Joko has only one wife. He enjoys heavy metal, and once traveled to Singapore for a Judas Priest concert. In a Muslim-dominated society, Mr. Joko has called for greater female participation in the work force. Eight of his 34 ministers are women, and they handle important portfolios like the foreign and finance ministries. “It’s very important for our economy to empower women,” Mr. Joko said. Walking through a food market on the tourist island of Bali last weekend, Mr. Joko noted that more than 90 percent of the stall owners were female. He talked up microfinancing initiatives for women. The market was spotless. Hillocks of guavas, avocados and hairy rambutan fruit were perfectly placed. A few years ago, the space was filthy, slick with fish guts and rotting produce underfoot, stall owners said. This year, Bali banned the use of single-use plastics, like plastic bags and straws, to tackle the tsunami of waste washing up on Indonesia’s once pristine beaches. The country is the second-largest producer of plastic waste in the world. Mr. Joko bought a pair of papayas from Made Warti, a 68-year-old fruit seller. Delighted that the president had stopped at her stand, she tried to stuff the fruit in a plastic bag before a member of the presidential entourage instructed her to use a cloth tote. She shrugged when asked about government initiatives for female entrepreneurs like herself; she had never heard of such a thing. In a country as scattered and corrupt as Indonesia, much can get lost between the highest levels of government policy and a shopkeeper trying to make a living. The crowds jostled Mr. Joko as he caressed fruit and posed for a seemingly endless procession of selfies. The day before, he had spent hours in a mall and other venues doing the same. Smile, smile, smile. Sometimes, his admirers were so nervous that their sweaty fingers could not activate the buttons to trigger their phone cameras. Mr. Joko was happy to take over the controls. “I’m your president so I work for you,” he joked as one fan handed over his cellphone. “That’s my job.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Just 7 Points, Kyle Lowry Was Still the Raptors’ Steadying Force","On Pro Basketball TORONTO — Kyle Lowry left the Raptors’ locker room late Thursday night wearing a contraption on his left hand that looked like an oven mitt. He is not 100 percent healthy at this late stage of the N.B.A. playoffs, and that does not make him unique among his peers. But he revealed this week that he cannot feel his left thumb during games. The injury — a dislocation that he managed to aggravate at some point in the Raptors’ postseason run — affects his passing, but Lowry has learned to compensate. It is not his shooting hand, and there is too much at stake, anyway. He is not making excuses, not when he and the Raptors are in the N.B.A. finals for the first time. Lowry, 32, had waited years for Thursday night. For the biggest stage of all. For the flashiest spotlight that the league can produce. It did not disappoint. “It was everything that you wanted,” Lowry said. In the Raptors’ 118-109 victory over the Golden State Warriors in the opening game of the series, Lowry did not produce the most majestic stat line of his life: 7 points, nine assists and six rebounds while shooting 2 of 9 from the field in 36 minutes. But the Raptors outscored the Warriors by 11 points when he was on the court, and he was a steadying force at point guard who picked his spots. It was a good night for Lowry’s performance, as the team’s new star, Kawhi Leonard, was only 5-for-14. There was the charge Lowry drew on the Warriors’ Draymond Green late in the first half. The heat-seeking pass he threw to Danny Green for a 3-pointer and a 10-point lead at halftime. The charge he drew on the Warriors’ DeMarcus Cousins at a critical stage of the fourth quarter. (So. Many. Charges.) And finally, the 29-footer he buried with 30.8 seconds left to polish off the win. The 3-pointer was just Lowry’s second made field goal of the game. He left a lot of the scoring to teammate Pascal Siakam, who finished with 32 points on 14-of-17 shooting. Lowry was neither explosive nor prolific. But he did all that was necessary, without the frills. “One of the best things about this team is that you don’t have to put a burden of 20 to 25 points on him,” Raptors Coach Nick Nurse said, “because he’s going to defend, he’s going to lead the team, he’s going to make those tough plays. He just intrinsically does that game after game after game.” A five-time All-Star and 13-year pro, Lowry has spent the past seven seasons with the Raptors. For so long, he has been synonymous with both the franchise and its history of postseason disappointments. The last three seasons, the Raptors got knocked out of the Eastern Conference playoffs by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. James’s departure for the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency last summer opened a door for the Raptors, and they took advantage. Lowry, meanwhile, had promised himself that he would never attend a finals game as a spectator until he reached one as a player. And he kept his word — season after season. Ahead of Thursday’s game, Lowry tried to keep his life as normal as possible. His family helped. (“I got kids,” he said.) But the buzz at Scotiabank Arena was something else entirely. It was louder, more electric, more hyped. Lowry consciously kept his cool, resisting the urge to play anything other than his usual brand of understated basketball. “Winning,” he said. “That’s all I care about. The numbers and stats and stuff like that doesn’t matter to me.” The Raptors have enough options on offense that Lowry can do what he does best and operate as a pass-first point guard, as old school as that sounds. Leonard can score, even if he had his struggles in Game 1 (Leonard still finished with 23 points, eight rebounds and five assists). Marc Gasol can score. And Siakam certainly can. So there was Lowry, passing and screening and throwing himself in front of tank-size power forwards before they could get to the basket. “We need his scoring, and we certainly need his spacing and some of his head-down drives where he makes contact and gets to the line,” Nurse said. “Those are really important. But again, I think that this team can, a lot of times, absorb some nights where he just plays really well and doesn’t score.” As everyone knows by now, Masai Ujiri, the Raptors’ president of basketball operations, swung a huge off-season deal to trade for Leonard. To acquire him, Ujiri had to ship DeMar DeRozan to the San Antonio Spurs. The same DeRozan who was one of the twin faces of the Raptors organization along with Lowry. The same DeRozan who was one of Lowry’s best friends. Lowry was devastated. Earlier this season, he went so far as to do his pregame high-five routine with an invisible DeRozan. (He really missed his pal.) It was not until Ujiri and Lowry had a conversation before the All-Star break that they were able to resolve some of their differences. Their relationship has not always been smooth. “It was just: Let’s get on the same page so we can make this run,” Lowry said. “Because we believed in what we could do as a team.” For his part, Ujiri said: “There’s something about that guy that I just believe in. It’s incredible. We have been through so much, and he’s a winner. There’s no other way to put it: He’s a winner. He’s been hit upside the head from every different angle in the world, whether it’s personal — everything — and he survives it.” Lowry survived the trade, survived the wait for the finals and survived Game 1 against the Warriors. He got exactly what he wanted all along. Now, he wants even more. “We got another one coming,” he said. “We can’t be happy with just one game.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Kawhi Leonard, the Raptors Find Success That Endures","TORONTO — Twenty-four seasons, 1,920 regular-season games, 18 playoff series, 99 playoff games. It took until the 100th postseason game in franchise history, but the Toronto Raptors clinched their first N.B.A. finals appearance with a 100-94 victory on their home floor against the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday, winning the Eastern Conference finals in six games. Success has been fleeting for the only remaining N.B.A. franchise in Canada. Toronto’s first draft pick, Damon Stoudamire in 1995, won the Rookie of the Year Award but demanded a trade and was in Portland before the end of his third season. Vince Carter gave the Raptors their first taste of national attention, with his jaw-dropping performance at the 2000 slam dunk contest during All-Star weekend and a playoff duel with Allen Iverson a year later. But in 2004, he, too, demanded a trade and ended a golden era before it even started. Chris Bosh was the next superstar in line, but he managed just two first-round exits in his seven seasons with the Raptors, before he left in free agency in 2010 to join LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in Miami. DeMar DeRozan blossomed into a star during his nine years with the team, but Masai Ujiri, the president of the Raptors, grew tired of the team’s annual playoff flameouts, and last summer traded DeRozan, the one player who had declared his desire to remain a Toronto Raptor for life. That trade sent a stunned DeRozan to the San Antonio Spurs for the quiet and talented Kawhi Leonard, who was one year away from free agency. He was a considerable risk for Toronto. But he also gave the Raptors exactly what they needed in an Eastern Conference finally freed from the dominance of James, who had joined the Los Angeles Lakers: a two-way superstar capable of being the best player in any playoff series. [N.B.A. Finals Preview: The Warriors should worry more about the Raptors than who might win Finals M.V.P.] The trade has been validated in every way during Leonard’s historic postseason run, which gave the N.B.A. its first Game 7 series-clinching buzzer beater, against the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round. He is already third among the franchise’s career postseason scorers, trailing only DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. Leonard has 11 games of at least 30 points in this postseason. He is a dominant scorer, but his all-around game has also been on display. The Raptors won the last four games of their series against the Bucks after Toronto Coach Nick Nurse made Leonard the primary defender against Giannis Antetokounmpo in Game 3. In Game 5 on Thursday, Leonard notched a career-high nine assists to go with 35 points in a road victory. On Saturday, with an N.B.A. finals berth at stake, Leonard grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds and added 27 points, punctuating his claim for best player in the playoffs with a thunderous one-handed slam over Antetokounmpo in the fourth quarter. After Game 2, the Bucks were two wins away from an Eastern Conference championship, and were 10-1 in the postseason following 60 wins in the regular season. In four games, Leonard erased Milwaukee’s magical season by being the best player on both ends of the floor. In a single playoff run, Leonard has delivered more memorable moments for the Raptors than anyone in the 24-year history of the franchise. On media day in September at the start of the season, after the formal introduction of Leonard in a Raptors uniform, Ujiri became frustrated with reporters who kept wondering whether Toronto was perceived in N.B.A. circles as a team and a city capable of persuading a superstar of Leonard’s caliber to stay long term. “We have nothing to apologize about,” Ujiri said. “This is a beautiful city. We are blessed to be one of the N.B.A. teams, one that’s not in America. I can’t believe a beautiful city like this would not believe in itself.” On Saturday, eight months after their partnership officially started, Ujiri stood next to Leonard as they accepted the Eastern Conference championship trophy in front of their home fans. “Kawhi is the best player in the world, and we are happy that he is in Toronto,” Ujiri said. Shortly after the trophy presentation, Leonard said: “I don’t care about being the best player. I want to be the best team.” After years of trying to break through, the Raptors can now call themselves the best team in the Eastern Conference. They are four wins away from a championship, and on Thursday the N.B.A. finals will start in Canada for the first time in league history. Saturday’s win was an unburdening of two and a half decades of frustration for a fan base that has continued to grow as the popularity of basketball in Canada has risen. Two other major sports franchises in the city are in the midst of championship droughts. The Toronto Blue Jays haven’t won the World Series since 1993. The Toronto Maple Leafs last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. The Raptors have a chance to make history for not just the franchise, but for the city of Toronto. For the first time, the fan base doesn’t have to wallow in the past or wonder about the uncertain future of Leonard’s free agency decision. It can live in the present, rooting for a team that has shown what can be. Leonard’s postseason run will be talked about in Toronto for decades to come. Perhaps there’s still one more chapter left to be written, starting Thursday at home against the Golden State Warriors. An earlier version of this article misstated the final score of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. The Toronto Raptors beat the Milwaukee Bucks, 100-94, not 100-96.",The New York Times
2019,"With Maduro Still in Power, Questions About the U.S. Role in Venezuela","News Analysis WASHINGTON — Nobody said regime change was going to be easy. President Trump’s top advisers woke up Tuesday believing that a rebellion in the Venezuelan military that day would galvanize a popular uprising and topple a leader they have described as a reviled despot who must be replaced. But at day’s end, President Nicolás Maduro was still in power and Mr. Trump’s advisers were left to blame Cuba, Russia and three influential Venezuelan officials, who failed to switch sides, for frustrating their plans. The decision of the Venezuelans to stand with Mr. Maduro — either because they were intimidated, got cold feet or never planned to defect — raised questions about whether the United States had faulty intelligence about the ability of the opposition to peel away members of his government. It also raised questions about whether Mr. Trump’s aides had fallen victim to a misreading of events on the ground, or whether Mr. Trump, who officials say has sometimes outrun his aides in an enthusiasm for forcing out Mr. Maduro, might lose faith in the effort as it wears on. Mr. Maduro has been weakened at home and discredited abroad, but he remains a stubborn rival unwilling to step aside for the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, recognized by the United States as the country’s de facto leader. While the administration got off to a sure-footed start on Venezuela, rallying dozens of countries against the Venezuelan president, critics said its response had become haphazard and chaotic as the crisis has dragged on. Mr. Trump’s aides banked on Mr. Guaidó’s call for mass protests and the defection of the Venezuelan officials on Tuesday as a turning point in the three-month campaign to oust Mr. Maduro. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted their support for “Operación Libertad,” while the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, called it a “potentially dispositive moment.” Mr. Trump did not mention the operation, but later on Tuesday, he assailed Cuba for its backing of Mr. Maduro, threatening to hit it with an embargo and new sanctions. Current and former officials said he was keenly interested in dislodging the Venezuelan leader, even raising the prospect in private meetings of limited American military involvement to hasten that outcome. Still, Mr. Trump came into office rejecting the interventionist tendencies of his predecessors, and he has said less publicly about Venezuela than his aides, who have turned regime change into a social media crusade. Mr. Bolton has tweeted hundreds of times about the crisis, taped videos for the Venezuelan people and appeared almost daily on cable news shows to discuss it. To serve as special envoy to Venezuela, Mr. Pompeo recruited Elliott Abrams, even though the White House had vetoed him for other jobs because of his criticism of Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Abrams is known for his neoconservative views and experience under President Ronald Reagan, where he was involved in the secret plan to supply weapons to the contras fighting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and in the George W. Bush administration, where he was a proponent of the Iraq war. While Mr. Trump has used charged language with adversaries — especially Iran — he has generally shrunk from trying to force out their leaders in favor of his preferred candidate, believing that it prompts costly and futile military entanglements. He has held talks with Kim Jong-un of North Korea and offered to speak to the Iranian leaders. Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo, by contrast, have spoken frequently about the need for Mr. Maduro to go, and raised hopes that Mr. Guaidó was on the cusp of driving him out. “I worry that this kind of semiregular raising of expectations to very high levels wears — and makes the kind of internal pressure that needs to build harder to happen,” said Daniel Restrepo, a former Latin America adviser in the National Security Council during the Obama administration. As both sides in Venezuela dug in, administration officials pinned the blame on different culprits. Mr. Pompeo called out the Russians, claiming they had talked Mr. Maduro out of boarding a plane and fleeing the country on Tuesday morning before the protests started. Mr. Bolton dwelt on the role of the three officials: Vladimir Padrino López, the defense minister; Maikel Moreno, the chief judge of the Supreme Court; and Rafael Hernández Dala, the commander of Mr. Maduro’s presidential guard. He said they would forfeit their chance to have Treasury Department sanctions against them lifted if they did not honor what he said was their pledge to join Mr. Guaidó’s forces. State Department officials have said they recognize it may take weeks or even months for Mr. Maduro to fall. The United States has not set any deadlines, nor has it moved beyond the president’s warning that military force is an option. But the flurry of statements by Mr. Trump’s top aides suggest the White House is less patient. Mr. Trump is being prodded to take an aggressive position on Venezuela by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. Ousting Mr. Maduro would be extremely popular with the Cuban exile community in South Florida, which views the socialist government in Venezuela as a proxy for Cuba. The National Security Council held a principals’ meeting on Wednesday to discuss “what additional steps need to be taken to speed up and secure a peaceful transition of power,” Mr. Bolton said. Mr. Pompeo called the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, to warn Moscow not to interfere in Venezuela. “Intervention by Russia and Cuba is destabilizing for Venezuela and for the U.S.-Russia bilateral relationship,” Mr. Pompeo told Mr. Lavrov, according to the State Department. The Venezuelan opposition may have been the source for the information that the three senior officials were considering backing Mr. Guaidó. But Mr. Bolton’s diatribe Tuesday, in which he repeatedly called out the three men by name, was most likely a considered move, according to a former Trump administration official. Mr. Bolton favors a “wink, wink, nod, nod” strategy aimed at weakening Mr. Maduro, the former official said, referring to a recent episode in which he scrawled a note about deploying American troops to Colombia on a yellow legal pad where reporters could easily spot it. The official said he believed it was less likely that Mr. Bolton had been taken in by bad intelligence and more likely that he was using that intelligence to run his own counterintelligence operation. By calling out the Venezuelan officials, Mr. Bolton would either push the three men to take action if they were planning to support Mr. Guaidó or — if they had a change of heart — undermine Mr. Maduro’s faith in them. The administration has been generally skeptical of information from the Venezuelan opposition, although Mr. Trump does receive some information directly from Mr. Rubio or Senator Rick Scott, Florida’s other Republican senator. One area where the White House has been at odds with the C.I.A. is the agency’s assessment of Cuban participation and support for the Maduro government. Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo have consistently criticized Cuba for its support for the Venezuelan government. But the C.I.A. has concluded that Cuba is far less involved and its support has been far less important than senior officials in the administration believe, according to a former official. Military options do not appear to have been fleshed out in detail at the White House, and on Wednesday, Pentagon officials played down the prospect of intervention. But the recent events could cause the administration to look at developing potential courses of action. Nobody emerged stronger from Tuesday’s chaotic events, analysts said. Mr. Guaidó failed to muster military support for the overthrow of the government, but the military looked like fence-sitters, which weakened Mr. Maduro’s position. And the United States appeared to go all in on a forced transfer of power, only to see it evaporate. Some analysts said that in their frustration, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton revealed potentially sensitive intelligence, burning those channels. Mr. Pompeo’s comments about Russian messages to Mr. Maduro could force the Venezuelan leader to use a more secure communications channel. And Mr. Bolton’s conspicuous naming of the three Venezuelans could head off any future discussions with them about switching sides. “The question is, to what objective?” said Fernando Cutz, a former acting senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council in the Trump administration. “There would have been a significant benefit to keep those channels open so we could try again or just to get intelligence out of them.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Miguel Andujar Returning, Yankees’ Injury Nightmare Starts to Fade","Yankees 6, Twins 3 It has been more than a month since Miguel Andujar partly tore the labrum in his right shoulder, which in injured list time is nearly an eternity. When he said on Friday that waiting to be activated had been “tough,” it felt like a colossal understatement. Such is the impatience of Andujar, the runner-up for the American League’s Rookie of the Year Award last season, who has totaled just 13 at-bats in 2019. Finally, though, that is about to change. Andujar will be activated before Saturday’s game against the Minnesota Twins, Manager Aaron Boone said on Friday, and the sense of relief will be palpable from the dugout to the bleachers at Yankee Stadium. With the Yankees’ lineup full of emergency call-ups and bench players, Andujar’s return could be just the beginning of the end of the team’s injury nightmare: Aaron Hicks, battling a bad back since spring training, will begin playing minor league games in Tampa next week; Clint Frazier’s sprained ankle has sufficiently healed for the Yankees to project activating him on Monday; and D.J. LeMahieu, who has been nursing a sore knee, could be added to the lineup on Saturday, as well. There are still big names who are far from returning, though: Luis Severino (lat strain) and Aaron Judge (oblique strain) are nowhere near being ready for game-related activities, and Giancarlo Stanton (strained biceps) has not swung a bat competitively since the end of March. And as yet another reminder of the Yankees’ frailty, starter James Paxton had to leave Friday’s game after three innings because of soreness in his left knee. Paxton, a left-hander, said he did not believe the injury was serious — “It was just barking for some reason; I don’t think it’s going to be anything long term” — but he will nevertheless have a magnetic resonance imaging test on Saturday morning. Paxton described the sensation as a dull pain that made it difficult to gather himself over the rubber as he began his delivery. The Yankees, who used five relievers to compensate for Paxton’s early exit, nevertheless shut down the Twins, 6-3, in the opening act of what could be a could be a telling seven-game homestand. They are about to test themselves against the Twins, the Seattle Mariners and the Tampa Bay Rays — all clubs with winning records. Going into Friday night, the Yankees were 0-5 against clubs above .500. So it was no wonder Andujar’s return is being regarded as a difference-maker — he is likely to plug into the No. 6 spot, which is currently manned by Gio Urshela. The question, however, will not be so much about Andujar’s power and bat speed, as neither figured to be affected by the shoulder injury. Rather, it is his defense — specifically, his ability to throw across the diamond from third base — that will decide whether avoiding surgery on the shoulder was wise. Make no mistake: Playing the rest of the season with a partial labral tear is a gamble. Although all parties expressed confidence that Andujar would be fine, a dose of uncertainty remains over how the shoulder will hold up after repeated high-velocity throws in high-stress situations. “Anytime you walk out on the field, you’re at risk,” Boone said before the game. “But I don’t think he would be going out there if we thought like this was something, if you’re throwing or whatever, he would hurt himself more.” Andujar has passed every test so far in the trainer’s room and in minor league games in Tampa. With each day, his confidence grew, and he worried less about the ramifications of making the injury worse: The first time he needs to gun a late-inning throw to first, Andujar said, he will be ready. And to ease his transition and the concern over reinjuring the shoulder, the Yankees intend to give Andujar at-bats as a designated hitter. Needless to say, Andujar is not being choosy about his playing time, not after spending endless days as an outsider on his own team. “It’s been tough to watch the games and not have the opportunity to compete,” Andujar said through an interpreter. “It’s the first time in my career that I’ve gone down with an injury and been on the sidelines and not been able to help. For sure, it’s been tough.” Andujar is fortunate in one regard: His low, three-quarter delivery puts less strain on his arm than a conventional, higher arm-slot. And the fact that he is an infielder and not a pitcher also makes a difference: Infielders can salvage the season with a compromised labrum; a pitcher, however, would almost certainly be headed for surgery. Andujar may yet require an operation this winter; he said the club had not discussed it with him. Boone, for one, repeated the company line that Andujar would not be on the field if the risk were great. For now, the Yankees are focusing on the coming challenges and seeking to answer lingering questions to glean a truer sense of who they are. Is this a roster that was merely good enough to beat up on weaker opponents like the Kansas City Royals and the San Francisco Giants? Or can the Yankees hold their own against two division leaders (the Twins and the Rays) and the team with the majors’ most dominant lineup so far (the Mariners)? The verdict will soon be returned, but either way, the Yankees are glad Andujar has finally joined them for the litmus test. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Gio Urshela. He is in his first season with the Yankees; he is not a rookie. An earlier version also misstated the length of the Yankees’ current homestand. It is seven games, not 10.",The New York Times
2019,"With Mix of Threats and Blandishments, Trump Bandies Policy of Regime Change","News Analysis WASHINGTON — Shortly before he was sworn in as president, Donald J. Trump vowed that the United States would stop “racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn’t be involved with.” He promised to end “this destructive cycle of intervention and chaos.” Two and a half years into his presidency, Mr. Trump is enthusiastically calling for the toppling of one regime, in Venezuela, and energetically undermining another, in Iran. His administration’s escalating economic and political pressure on both countries — alongside a reignited trade war with China — has raised tensions in two hemispheres to the highest levels since Mr. Trump took the oath of office. It is not just that the president is pushing policies he once denounced. He has yet to articulate a coherent theory for when the United States should push for such change and when it should avoid it. As with so much else in his presidency, Mr. Trump’s approach to foreign intervention is largely ad hoc and idiosyncratic — driven less by ideology than by his hunger for foreign policy victories and confidence in his own deal-making skills. Mr. Trump, for example, gave up on President Barack Obama’s commitment to oust President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, deciding instead that American military force there should be used only to vanquish the Islamic State. And he is sticking with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, despite the fact that Mr. Kim recently fired a fusillade of missiles after his stalled nuclear negotiations with the president. The lack of ideological coherence has played to the advantage of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, two hawkish officials with strong interventionist tendencies. They have filled the vacuum left by Mr. Trump with aggressive moves on Iran and Venezuela that recall those of George W. Bush in the Middle East and Ronald Reagan in Latin America. Critics say the disconnect between Mr. Trump and his advisers is confusing the nation’s allies and heightening the risk of a military conflict — perhaps one that the president does not even want. His lack of conviction about bringing down a government, some say, also guarantees that the United States will not shoulder the financial burden to rebuild Venezuela if its embattled president, Nicolás Maduro, is eventually forced out. “There is a fundamental conflict between the administration’s desire for regime change and what it is willing to do to bring it about,” said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who served in the Bush administration. “That is the contradiction of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy.” The president’s defenders argue he has not strayed far from the position he took during the 2016 campaign. Mr. Trump has ordered the withdrawal of American forces from Syria and Afghanistan, over the objections of his military commanders, although troops remain in both war zones. He has also continued to conduct high-risk nuclear negotiations with Mr. Kim despite the deep skepticism of advisers like Mr. Bolton, who as a private citizen called for pre-emptive military strikes on North Korea two months before he entered the West Wing. “He really hasn’t changed his stance, except for calling for the ouster of Maduro, which I believe is more of a moral statement than an expression of using American military force to topple the Venezuelan regime,” said Michael N. Anton, a former spokesman for the National Security Council during the Trump administration. Still, other former officials say Mr. Trump’s position has been muddied by Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton. While both men faithfully repeat the American position is that it is not seeking the overthrow of the Iranian government, Mr. Pompeo has outlined 12 demands — like halting ballistic missile tests and withdrawing support for militant groups in Yemen and Lebanon — that United States officials know the current leaders in Tehran will never honor. When Mr. Pompeo was asked last week if he believed the Iranian leadership could ever change its behavior enough to satisfy the administration, he said no. “I think what can change is the people can change the government,” Mr. Pompeo told Michael J. Morell, a former acting director of the C.I.A., for his podcast, “Intelligence Matters.” “What we’re trying to do is create space for the Iranian people.” Mr. Trump himself once claimed he would be open to a dialogue with Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani. But he also warned Mr. Rouhani last July that Iran would suffer “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before” if it ever threatened the United States. The same mix of threats and blandishments helped bring Mr. Kim to the table in Singapore last June for the first of two summit meetings with Mr. Trump. “Trump has a foreign policy perspective that if you can force these governments to come to the table, you can perhaps get a grand bargain,” said Vali R. Nasr, the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, who worked in the Obama administration. “But his team is not following the same script.” On North Korea, Mr. Nasr said, Mr. Trump more clearly articulated his preferences, going so far as to sideline Mr. Bolton before the Singapore meeting when his comparison of North Korea to Libya angered the North Korean leader. “With Iran,” Mr. Nasr said, “the fingerprints of his team on the policy is more evident than his own views.” The phrase “regime change” has languished in disrepute since the Iraq war, Mr. Haass noted, even though the notion of rolling back hostile governments has been a feature of American foreign policy for decades. Mr. Bolton was an avid proponent of that war and has never publicly reconsidered his judgment that sending American troops to Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein was the right course. The problem, Mr. Haass said, is that regime change strategies rarely work, and even when they do, the cost is prohibitively high. Last week, the White House was frustrated by the failure of a plan by the Venezuelan opposition to peel away three key senior government officials, which they hoped would prompt a broader revolt by the military and force Mr. Maduro out of office. When the three officials stuck with the government, the plan fizzled, and now the opposition faces fresh obstacles in its quest to remove Mr. Maduro. Mr. Trump shelved the policy of unseating Mr. Assad in Syria because the cost was too high militarily, Mr. Haass said. The president is likely to face the same dilemma with Iran: Although the administration’s sanctions have imposed a fierce cost on the Iranian economy, they are not by themselves punitive enough to incite the kind of mass uprising that would force a deeply entrenched leadership out of power. transcript And the prospect of an Iraq-style invasion of Iran is hard to contemplate. Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton both insist they do not seek war with Iran, though in moving an aircraft carrier strike force to the region this week, Mr. Bolton warned that the United States would hit back with “unrelenting force” if Iran attacked American interests or allies. “They’re talking about regime change, but we don’t have the tools to bring it about,” Mr. Haass said. “What does the administration do when it doesn’t get what it wants? Is it willing to have a more expensive foreign policy?”",The New York Times
2019,"With Sculpture, Frieze Expands to Manhattan","Rockefeller Center was transformed over four nights. The flags of the countries in the United Nations, which normally surround the skating rink, were taken down and replaced with recycled jute bags once used to carry coffee, concrete and other materials. On the main plaza between 30 Rockefeller Plaza and the skating rink, seven sculptures appeared, among them a split stone, a door of sorts and a raised fist that morphs into a gramophone. On Fifth Avenue, a white head with disembodied hands over its eyes loomed at 28 feet. Even the entrances to several buildings were made new overnight, with sculptures tucked into lobbies. These pieces, all for sale by galleries, are part of the inaugural edition of Frieze Sculpture at Rockefeller Center, a public art installation that opened to the public on April 25 and will be up until June 28. It features 20 sculptures by 14 artists, placed like Easter eggs around the whole of Rockefeller Center. The initiative, presented by Frieze New York and Tishman Speyer, which owns Rockefeller Center, is expanding the Randalls Island-based art fair’s footprint into Manhattan with work by artists including Hank Willis Thomas, Kiki Smith, Ibrahim Mahama, Sarah Sze, Walter De Maria and Joan Miró. The display is meant “to do something outside of our five-day event where we engage with people in the city who may not be people who come out to an art fair,” said Loring Randolph, Frieze’s artistic director for the Americas. “This is a free, open-platform experience that anyone can go to and learn from.” It was inspired in part by Frieze Sculpture in Regent’s Park, an offshoot of the London fair, but its highly urban setting, in one of the most heavily trafficked parts of the city, sets it apart. Brett Littman, director of the Noguchi Museum, is the curator. Conversation around public sculpture has been fraught lately, particularly since the unveiling of Thomas Heatherwick’s much-maligned Vessel at Hudson Yards, which was called “ruinously manspreading” by Michael Kimmelman, The New York Times architecture critic. Then there are those strange bronze rabbits and rhinos and dogs that keep popping up around the city, often through commissions from business improvement districts. With all this in mind, curators of public sculpture are wondering how to do better. How can one bring public sculpture responsibly to a city that suffer is from the homogenization of space? (“It’s a huge responsibility,” Ms. Randolph said. “We take that very seriously.”) The Frieze installation’s approach is largely about balance, variety and small-scale sculpture. Mr. Littman selected a wide variety of artists — most of them living and working today — and placed them in conversation with the spaces they are in. In addition to the lobbies, he used the flagpoles and even a small space in a garden, where four of Rochelle Goldberg’s sculptures are displayed. “As much as I love monumental sculpture, I think there is a great way of showing nonmonumental sculpture in the middle of the city, and to have quiet moments and contemplation,” Mr. Littman said. (There is a monumental piece, too, in the large head with covered eyes — Jaume Plensa’s “Behind the Walls,” which Mr. Littman noted would “probably be the most Instagrammed and photographed part of the show.”) Mr. Littman’s approach was also in part about the history of public art in and around Rockefeller Center. Ms. Loring and Mr. Littman said their thinking about the fair began with Isamu Noguchi’s “News,” a bas-relief commissioned by The Associated Press in 1938 that depicts five journalists in action. When it was unveiled in 1940 with great fanfare, it was the largest and heaviest stainless steel sculpture ever made. The work inspired Ms. Randolph to ask Mr. Littman to curate the show because of his leadership of the Noguchi Museum. “I wanted to tie in a relationship with an object that had existed there historically,” she said. The politics of sculpture in the center have long been complicated, too; Nelson Rockefeller had a mural painted by Diego Rivera at 30 Rockefeller Plaza destroyed in 1934 because it included a portrait of Lenin. There are several overtly political pieces in the installation — including Mr. Mahama’s replacement of the United Nations flags, a critique of globalism that deals with labor, transportation of materials and the history of trade — that may not translate so obviously into an Instagram post. Representation of artists was also an important part of Mr. Littman’s curatorial approach; he said he had to “actively fight” to have female artists represented in the show, after most galleries proposed men. Four of the 14 artists represented are women, which, Mr. Littman said, “is not a fantastic rate, but it’s better than zero.” Many of the artists featured are not white and not American. “For me, it was about democratizing the sculpture park,” he said. It was also, he said, about shrinking the scale and exploring new spaces in the city-within-a-city that Rockefeller Center is. “In some ways, maybe New York City is the giant sculpture,” he said, “and maybe the sculpture in it doesn’t need to be giant.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Sudan’s Revolution in the Balance, Darfur Moves Center Stage","KHARTOUM, Sudan — When the first winds of a revolution blew across Sudan last winter, threatening to upend decades of corrupt and destructive rule, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir needed to find a scapegoat. He got Ayob Omer. Mr. Omer, a 28-year-old veterinary student from Darfur, was scooped up by intelligence thugs outside his university dorm in Khartoum on Dec. 22, days after the first anti-government protest. He was spirited away to a safehouse where he said he was interrogated, tortured with electricity and, after a few days, forced to sit before a camera and read a prepared statement. “I participated in the protests,” he said in a recording later broadcast on state television. “I was carrying a bag and a knife.” His ordeal was part of a propaganda drive orchestrated by Mr. al-Bashir’s security services to blame the revolt on saboteurs from Darfur, the western region where up to 300,000 people have died since 2003 in a government-sponsored campaign to subdue it through pillage, murder and rape. The state intelligence service claimed that Mr. Omer, along with five other Darfuri dissidents who were also forced to appear on TV, had been trained by Israel. That effort was an abject failure. Not only was Mr. al-Bashir ousted by his own lieutenants in April and then sent to prison, but Darfuris have also emerged as some of the loudest and most impassioned supporters of Sudan’s continuing revolution. Casting aside decades of war, suffering and racial discrimination in a country where the epithet “slave” is still in use, Darfuris are seizing Sudan’s fragile political opening to make their voices heard like never before. Outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, where thousands are demanding a swift transition to civilian rule, Darfuris stand defiantly at the gates of the military that persecuted them for years. Some hold banners with graphic photos that depict the atrocities they say were visited on their community: piled corpses, torched villages, rape victims sitting mutely. In street speeches, Darfuri leaders issue strident demands for Mr. al-Bashir, currently incarcerated at a notorious Khartoum prison, to be dispatched to the International Criminal Court in The Hague to face decade-old charges of genocide and war crimes in Darfur. Sometimes other Sudanese come up to the Darfuris at the protest site, tears in their eyes, offering solidarity and even apologies for the years of suffering. “Today we feel proud to be Sudanese,” said Adam Osman, a 23-year-old student from Jebel Marra, a mountainous district of Darfur that in 2016 was subjected to “scorched earth” tactics according to Amnesty International. “We are born again; we are renewing our country. I am flying without wings.” Around him people chanted: “Darfur, we are with you. Darfur, you are our brothers.” But under the tide of euphoria and hope run currents of apprehension and fear over what comes next in Sudan. Talks between protest leaders and Sudan’s generals over who should hold power during a transitional period before elections are in their fifth week and growing increasingly testy. On Wednesday, protest leaders threatened to start a campaign of civil disobedience, including mass strikes, if their demands are not met. The generals insist they will not disperse the protest with force, yet they show few signs of compromise. Darfuris, in particular, have reason to be worried. The same generals who ousted Mr. al-Bashir also led the fight in Darfur during the 2000s, when a conflict rooted in ethnic tensions quickly spiraled into a human rights catastrophe that attracted global attention through celebrities like the actor George Clooney, and that confirmed the pariah status of Sudan’s American-sanctioned government. Some Darfuri rebel factions declared a cease-fire in 2015, but sporadic violence has continued. On the other side, Sudanese generals have turned to other ventures, like recruiting young Darfuris to fight in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Others generals have grown rich from extensive business ventures in the region, including gold mining and cattle trading, or have partnered with the European Union to stifle illegal migration across Sudan’s eastern desert. Many are unapologetic about their role in the war. “We were fighting the rebels, not the people,” said Lt. Gen. Salah Abdelkhalig, the head of Sudan’s air force and a veteran of the Darfur campaign, during an interview in which he denied the military had committed any atrocities. While the army treats the protesters camped outside its gates in Khartoum with kid gloves, it has been more aggressive in Darfur, far from the scrutiny of news cameras. Last Sunday, soldiers shot dead a protester outside a military base in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur. Of the 90 people killed in the protests throughout Sudan since December, 14 have died in Darfur, the largest number of any area outside Khartoum, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, which has been tabulating casualties. Yet for all that, many Darfuris fervently hope this revolution can change everything. One night last week in Khartoum, Migdad Ahmed lay down to sleep on the street outside Sudan’s naval headquarters, exhausted yet exhilarated. The 21-year-old student had arrived in Khartoum a day earlier, part of a six-bus convoy that crossed Sudan, traveling 900 miles over three days, from the city of Geneina in western Darfur. Several of his uncles had been killed in the war, he said, and his family lives in a refugee camp where they rely on international aid to survive. Now, for the first time, he felt respected and heard in the capital. “When my voice gives out,” he said, pointing to a whistle tied to a string around his neck. “I use this.” For decades, Mr. al-Bashir cemented his authority by exploiting the differences inside his own country, favoring light-skinned Muslim Arabs from the central Nile Valley over darker-skinned, ethnically African people from the south, Darfur and the Nuba Mountains. Longstanding racial tensions grew deeper. Wars erupted. But Mr. al-Bashir’s efforts to paint the recent revolt against his rule as a Darfuri ploy quickly backfired. Soon after the footage of Mr. Omer and the five other activists, evidently tortured and coerced, appeared on television in December, a new chant erupted during anti-government protests: “You arrogant racist, we are all Darfur!” Yet the prejudice that motivated the Darfur conflict is deep-rooted and will not vanish easily, said Iether Ibrahim, 30, a doctor in Khartoum. In private, some northerners still throw about the insult “slave,” she said, in reference to a time when Arabs captured, traded and owned ethnically African tribespeople. “Here, people deal with you according to your shape and your color,” she added, pointing to her own face as an example. People in Khartoum often mistook her for an Arab, she said, because her mother is from northern Sudan. On being corrected, the same people are often doubly shocked to learn that her father is the Darfuri rebel leader Khalil Ibrahim, the founder of a group called the Justice and Equality Movement, who died in a bombing in 2011. Mr. Ibrahim’s brother, Gibril, currently leads the group. While she is not part of the armed struggle, Ms. Ibrahim said Darfuris were demanding accountability for past crimes. “To build a new country, justice must be done,” she said. But that seems unlikely under the ruling Military Transitional Council, because its leaders might also have to answer for their actions. Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s interim military leader, was once a commander in Darfur. His deputy, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, known as Hemeti, is the leader of a military force originally drawn from the Janjaweed, a horse-riding militia that carried out the worst atrocities in the 2000s. Both men are backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are hostile toward popular revolutions across the Middle East. “We should not forgive what he did,” said Mr. Omer, the tortured student activist, in reference to Hemeti. “Anyone who committed a crime should be subject to trial. We won’t accept anything else.” If Sudan’s revolution disappoints, and its generals refuse to cede power to the civilians, some Darfuris warn that optimism could sour into dangerous divisions with the potential to fracture Sudan even further. But for now, Mr. Omer, a supporter of the Darfuri armed resistance, believes in the power of protest. “The Sudanese people have finally broken the fear,” he said. “The revolution has started a discussion among the people, created space for unity. With that, we can make the country we want.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Trump’s Visit to Japan, Empress Masako Finds a Spotlight","TOKYO — On Sunday night, men in loincloths and samurai topknots stole the limelight from the president of the United States. On Monday, the new empress of Japan was the star. When the new Japanese emperor, Naruhito, and his wife, Masako, welcomed President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, to the palace on Monday morning during their four-day state visit, Masako, a multilingual former diplomat and Harvard graduate, became an instant hit on social media. The Japanese public marveled as she spoke fluently in English to Mrs. Trump — even though the emperor also spoke English to Mr. Trump until an official urged him to introduce his interpreter. “Masako sama can speak five languages,” one Twitter user wrote in a widely shared post, using an honorific term of address. “She is awesome and cool. I admire her. I hope she will demonstrate her ability more and more.” And the image of Masako chatting with Mr. Trump suggested to some that she will be able to use her diplomatic skills to help advance Japan’s soft power and perhaps even stake out a new role for women in the deeply patriarchal imperial family. “The shining smile of Masako sama is gleaming!” wrote one Twitter user. “Brilliant! She’s such a brilliant person. Ah, I really think that Masako sama’s stage is here! Diplomacy!” Many Japanese, but especially women, saw the international debut of Masako, 55, who has been married to Naruhito for 26 years, as a chance — finally — for her to use her training and experience after spending years trapped in her role as the woman whose primary mission was to produce an heir to the throne. “I think she is going to be coming into her own,” said Mihoko Suzuki, director of the Center for the Humanities at the University of Miami, who has written about women in monarchies. But the empress faces many obstacles in defining her own role in Japanese public life because strict codes dictate what she can and cannot do. Under the Imperial Household Law, which governs most matters of protocol related to Japan’s monarchy, Masako was not even permitted to attend the sacred ascension ceremony for her husband this month. Women are not allowed to sit on the throne. “The Japanese public is so excited and it seems like they are very much expecting Masako to take advantage of her previous career as a diplomat,” said Kumiko Nemoto, a professor of sociology at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies. “I’m sure she understands that there are lots of forces she needs to take account of and not overstep certain boundaries.” Because the Imperial Household Agency, which manages the imperial family’s every move, is one of the most traditional institutions in Japan and is dominated by mostly older Japanese men, “they expect Masako the empress to behave with always a certain smile and a very subservient type of womanhood,” Ms. Nemoto said. Monday’s banquet was not Masako’s first time sitting next to an American president. Just a month after her wedding in 1993, the public swooned when she sat between President Bill Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia at a state dinner in Tokyo and conversed easily with both in their own languages. But before long, the Japanese news media became consumed by one question: when Masako would have a child. Even after her daughter, Princess Aiko, was born in 2001, the Imperial Household Agency prohibited Masako from traveling abroad in case that would interfere with her ability to get pregnant again, prompting her to sink into depression and withdraw from public appearances altogether. At a 2004 news conference, Naruhito, who was then the crown prince, implicitly criticized the palace agency for placing so many restrictions on his wife. “I think it would be better if Princess Masako could go out with a little more freedom and be able to do a variety of things,” he said. As empress, Masako is likely to travel more freely. Her mother-in-law, Michiko, rarely left the side of Naruhito’s father, Akihito, who abdicated the throne at the end of April. Some analysts say Masako could carve out an independent role by championing causes she cares about rather than simply accompanying the emperor everywhere. “Now the role of women is more independent,” said Mari Miura, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. “Women have separate jobs from wives and mothers, so why shouldn’t Masako do that?” But in addition to the constraints of the monarchy, Masako also faces the same social pressures as her fellow countrywomen. “It’s desirable that women’s advancement in society is making progress,” Lully Miura, a political scientist who runs the Yamaneko Research Institute, wrote in an essay in the June edition of Bungei Shunju, a monthly magazine. “But women still take on a large part of delivering and raising children,” she added. “So dependable women tend to play the roles of wife and mother perfectly.” The emperor has been open about his wife’s struggles with depression and has said that her ability to perform her public duties could be affected by her mental health. With her first appearance as empress, the Japanese news media has seized on Masako’s apparent sunny disposition and declared that she appears much happier than she has in years. It is an alluring narrative, analysts say, but the situation is not so simple. “People do sympathize with her and they very much want her to be the Japanese princess who has the successful happy ending after all the trials she went through,” said Kathryn Tanaka, an associate professor of cultural and historical studies at Otemae University in Nishinomiya. “Everyone is cheering for her and rooting for her and wanting her to have this kind of happy ending. It may be something where the public has to accept what she’s able to do.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Uber’s I.P.O., Dara Khosrowshahi Is Taking Travis Kalanick’s Company Public","The C.E.O. wants to prove that the start-up has evolved past a raucous, and profligate, tech-bro culture. But Uber’s past is simply not that far gone. CreditCreditChris Koehler Dara Khosrowshahi had a problem. His name was Travis Kalanick. That, of course, was nothing new. When Mr. Khosrowshahi took over as chief executive of Uber in 2017, he became the best-compensated janitor in Silicon Valley, with a mandate to clean up the mess left by the company’s exiled founder. But this time, in mid-April, Mr. Khosrowshahi faced a Travis headache that lay in the future. Uber was just weeks away from its initial public offering. After years of scandal, infighting and user revolt, this was supposed to be a $91 billion moment of triumph, when employees would become wealthy and the public could buy a piece of an indisputably world-changing company. The problem for Mr. Khosrowshahi, according to two people briefed on the matter, was that Mr. Kalanick wanted to be there. As a former C.E.O. and current board member, Mr. Kalanick had asked to take part in the hallowed New York Stock Exchange tradition of ringing the opening bell on May 10, the day Uber shares are slated to begin trading. He also wanted to bring his father, Donald Kalanick. It would be close to the second anniversary of the accidental death of Travis Kalanick’s mother, and of the dramatic boardroom coup that ousted him as boss. His presence on the exchange’s iconic balcony could make both Mr. Kalanick and the corporation appear resilient. Mr. Khosrowshahi wasn’t having it. The original plan was to fill the rafters with Uber’s earliest employees and longest tenured drivers. Moreover, some people at the top of the company felt that Mr. Kalanick was still a toxic liability, and that Uber should keep him at maximum distance as it tried to convince constituents that employees truly abided by a new motto: “Do the right thing. Period.” Mr. Kalanick’s appearance would unavoidably rekindle public memories of just how much of a disaster his final year was. Besides, Mr. Khosrowshahi had bigger things to worry about than I.P.O. pageantry. Uber is losing billions of dollars annually, and he needs to convince investors that it is a promising, long-term company — even if it won’t be turning a profit anytime soon. He didn’t need the distraction at Uber’s financial coming-out party. On the evening of May 2, after The Times approached Uber for comment on this article, Mr. Khosrowshahi decided that Mr. Kalanick wasn’t welcome on the balcony, according to an Uber executive briefed on the plans. The C.E.O. wants to prove that the start-up has evolved past Mr. Kalanick’s raucous, tech-bro culture — and his strategy of setting barrels of money aflame in the pursuit of growth above all else. But Uber’s past, to state the obvious about a company that is only a decade old, is simply not that far gone. Almost every instance of Mr. Kalanick’s bare-knuckled approach to capitalism illuminates something about Uber’s viability as a business today. (Citing the quiet period before an I.P.O., representatives for Uber, Mr. Khosrowshahi and Mr. Kalanick all declined to comment.) The company has little good will with consumers or regulators in multiple jurisdictions. And Uber still loses money on nearly every fare, using venture capital to subsidize rides, invest in new areas and beat back a set of global competitors that offer an essentially identical service. Mr. Kalanick’s heavy reliance on venture funding could be problematic for a public Uber in at least two ways. Arguably, it instilled habits of indiscipline, because executives could simply ask for more money whenever they wanted it, like rich kids with no cap on their allowance. Second, and more troubling for retail investors, the bulk of investment returns might have already been realized. Uber acknowledged in a recent filing that its growth is slowing, fueling concern that venture firms, private equity shops, sovereign-wealth funds and other elite insiders have not left much upside for mom-and-pop investors. The last big beneficiary of Uber’s private-market gains might have been SoftBank. The Japanese mega-conglomerate bought existing shares from Uber investors at a nadir, when the company was valued at roughly $42 billion. Just months later, as Uber recovered from its string of scandals, those shares had nearly doubled in value. All I.P.O.s are by nature unpredictable, but with Uber the possible outcomes seem especially extreme. Is it a juggernaut that, like Amazon before it, will someday flip the switch to profitability? Or is it something more like eBay, a well-known but puttering giant with its best growth long since behind it? For now, Mr. Khosrowshahi’s job is to execute a drama-free public offering. He was able to use the chaotic events of Mr. Kalanick’s departure and his own hiring to secure a lucrative incentive. If he is able to attain a valuation of more than $120 billion for Uber over a period of 90 consecutive days, according to two people familiar with the matter and language included in Uber’s I.P.O. prospectus, Mr. Khosrowshahi will personally net stock bonuses of more than $100 million. Going public comes with additional scrutiny and financial reporting requirements — something Uber may have a tough time adjusting to. In the beginning, investors poured billions into the company while asking for little in return, trusting that the charismatic Mr. Kalanick knew what he was doing. When the start-up was founded in 2009, venture capitalists were looking everywhere to fund the next Larry Page of Google or Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook — the newest brilliant mind who might put a multibillion-dollar dent in the universe. Investors valued an entrepreneur’s zeal almost as much as the business plan he or she was selling. And nobody was more zealous than Mr. Kalanick. In his mind, historians would one day mention Uber in the same breath as titans like Apple and Google, world-changing corporations that shaped the way billions of people used technology in their daily lives. Investors liked the idea of disrupting the taxi industry and public transportation, but they liked Mr. Kalanick even more. Despite a little salt and pepper in his hair — born in 1976, he was practically middle-aged for Silicon Valley — Mr. Kalanick was trim and boyish, with an excess of kinetic energy. When he was dangling a chance at Uber equity in front of V.C.s, he was a force of nature, combining the oracular skills of Steve Jobs with the aggression of Alec Baldwin’s salesman character in “Glengarry Glen Ross.” Typically, start-ups go to venture firms’ offices to make their pitches. At its peak, Uber was in such demand that it flipped the power dynamic, making investors come to its San Francisco headquarters. Mr. Kalanick created a system based on scarcity. For one week, he would hold just three meetings per day with potential backers, forcing them to compete for slots. (He called the method the “homeshow,” in contrast with the traveling “roadshow” that pre-I.P.O. companies conduct.) Venture capitalists didn’t care that Uber was awash in red ink, as long as the user numbers kept climbing. By the end of 2016, Uber was valued at nearly $70 billion. But abruptly, by the middle of 2017, investors started to worry in earnest that their stakes were in jeopardy of shrinking to zero. A pileup of scandals among Uber employees — from sexual harassment charges to systematically evading law enforcement — all seemed to reflect Mr. Kalanick’s personality and disregard for outsiders, and they cast his business choices in a new light. Uber’s billions in losses could be interpreted as savvy investments, keeping competitors at bay in what would evolve into a winner-take-all market. Or they could be the heedless spending of someone who cared more about winning in the moment than building a long-term company. One way Uber got to a position of dominance in cities was by throwing incentives at drivers and lowering barriers to entry — so low that people who might have been prevented from driving in the official taxi industry could easily work for Uber. That included predators. Over time, the company received such a volume of sexual misconduct allegations that to keep track of them, it had to create its own taxonomy of 21 different kinds of misbehavior and assault. (The taxonomy was developed and made public in an “open source” approach, a move the company has said is an effort to improve safety across the ride-hailing industry.) All of a sudden, Uber’s sense of ubiquity and inevitability seemed to be much less of a sure thing. Over a whirlwind weekend in August 2017, Mr. Khosrowshahi was elected to replace Mr. Kalanick as C.E.O. He was a relative outsider to the Bay Area — Expedia, the company he’d been running, was based in Seattle — and he was not a household name. But he had a good reputation, a warm appearance and, to some, one more big advantage: He wasn’t Travis Kalanick. In the fall of 2017, not long after Mr. Khosrowshahi started his new job, six of Uber’s board members received calls from Barry Diller, the chairman and senior executive of InterActive Corporation and a longtime mentor of Mr. Khosrowshahi. Mr. Diller was being protective of his protégé, and wanted to know how, exactly, he had secured one of the most formidable C.E.O. positions in all of tech. Later, Mr. Diller called Mr. Khosrowshahi with his findings: He’d been elected almost accidentally, the result of warring factions on the board vying for two different candidates and finally settling on a third. That ended up being Mr. Khosrowshahi. “I really don’t know how you got this job,” Mr. Diller told Mr. Khosrowshahi, describing the level of chaos and utter dysfunction at the very top of Uber. “No one even voted for you.” Some 20 months later, many of Uber’s most important stakeholders consider Mr. Khosrowshahi’s appointment a stroke of luck. After parachuting into a profoundly fractured board, the C.E.O. has managed to make a kind of peace among the company’s directors, a group that includes Mr. Kalanick. Leaks about internal issues have largely stopped flowing to the press. Backbiting among executives has subsided. And Mr. Khosrowshahi has refrained from extravagances like booking Beyoncé to perform at private company functions, as Mr. Kalanick did in 2015, at a cost of $6 million in restricted stock units. Mr. Khosrowshahi’s admirers say the calm is a result of his long experience with corporate distress. After years of running InterActive Corporation’s mergers, acquisitions and finance divisions, Mr. Khosrowshahi was tapped to lead Expedia as chief executive in 2012 — a time of intense political drama inside the online travel company. Mr. Khosrowshahi stabilized some of the internal tumult, according to Neha Parikh, the president of Hotwire, who worked alongside Mr. Khosrowshahi at the time. “No matter who you are,” she said, “Dara makes you feel heard.” (From May 2015 until September 2017, Mr. Khosrowshahi was on The New York Times board.) At Uber, Mr. Khosrowshahi hired a slew of lawyers to plumb and correct years of the company’s legal deficiencies. He also edited Mr. Kalanick’s list of 14 cultural values. Ranging from “Always Be Hustlin’” to “Super Pumped,” they read like Amazon’s leadership principles run through a bro-speak translation engine; now they have been made into a blander set of eight platitudes. (Among them: “We persevere.”) Investors who had billions riding on Uber’s success have been happy to see a constant stream of negative headlines shrink to a trickle. While Mr. Khosrowshahi has seemed to successfully reform many of Uber’s cultural issues, skeptics note that the company’s business fundamentals remain much the same. Uber lost nearly $2 billion in 2018, the first full year under Mr. Khosrowshahi’s leadership. That comes even after a retreat from a number of costly battles with ride-hailing competitors in China, Russia and Southeast Asia. On Uber’s roadshow to pitch itself to institutional investors (there’s no “homeshow” this time around), Mr. Khosrowshahi has broken with Mr. Kalanick’s worldview that Uber is competing in a winner-take-all market. Ride-sharing will be a “winner-take-most” game, as Mr. Khosrowshahi puts it, according to people familiar with his presentation. He has also embraced the idea that his company is like Amazon — a logistics giant in the making. His pitch casts Uber’s sustained losses as both an attempt to defend its existing market share from competitors while simultaneously investing in Uber’s future growth. That story seeks to frame Uber as a technology “platform.” Ride-hailing, the thinking goes, is a mere jumping-off point for other markets, like bikes and scooters, food delivery, long-haul trucking — even flying cars. “Just like Amazon sells third-party goods, we are going to also offer third-party transportation services,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said in an interview last year. Still, Uber has no clear path to turning a profit in the next few years, and the risks section of its registration statement runs to 48 pages, out of 285 total. Shares of Lyft, its nearest competitor, have fallen some 26 percent since their March debut. Uber’s bankers seem to have internalized the doubts. After initially targeting an I.P.O. opening range of roughly $48 to $55 per share, Uber reduced expectations to roughly $44 to $50 per share at a valuation of $80 billion to $91 billion — significantly lower than the $90 billion to $100 billion range it originally sought. Despite all Mr. Khosrowshahi has done to distance Uber from its founder, Mr. Kalanick remains intimately connected to the company he built. He remains on Uber’s board, and Mr. Khosrowshahi has shown no signs of agitating for a shake-up of the group in the months following an I.P.O., as some had expected he would. Friends of Mr. Kalanick say that he feels unfairly targeted by Uber’s I.P.O. paperwork, and its implicit criticisms of his leadership. And every time Mr. Khosrowshahi uses the word “culture,” Mr. Kalanick considers it a thinly veiled synonym for his reign, according to people familiar with his thinking. They add that Mr. Kalanick hopes that his successor will use the I.P.O. to bury the hatchet between the two men, and mark a new chapter in Uber’s history. Even former enemies on the board, like Matt Cohler of Benchmark, have spoken in favor of Mr. Kalanick’s involvement, according to a report from Axios. No matter where he stands when Uber shares begin to trade — Mr. Kalanick could watch from the stock exchange floor, or skip the event entirely — he will have the consolation of making on paper several billion dollars. That is 600 times what Mr. Khosrowshahi’s stake will be worth. Not that he’s one to let that bother him. “He’s like Teflon. You can’t scratch him,” said Avid Larizadeh Duggan, Mr. Khosrowshahi’s cousin and the chief operating officer of Kobalt, a music start-up. “But it’s a positive way, not robotic. That’s why he’s such a good choice for this role, because you have to be — especially from where he started.” An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of Dara Khosrowshahi’s decision that Travis Kalanick wouldn’t take part in the ringing of the opening bell on May 10. The decision was made on the evening of May 2, not on May 3.",The New York Times
2019,"With Woodstock 50 in Peril, Michael Lang Is Defiant: ‘We’re Not Stopping Now’","The most widely read piece of news about Woodstock’s planned 50th anniversary festival this summer came on Monday, when Dentsu Aegis Network, the event’s financial backer, made a surprise announcement declaring it dead. The event, promoted by Michael Lang, one of the original partners in the legendary 1969 festival, was supposed to run from Aug. 16 to 18 in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with Jay-Z, Miley Cyrus, Imagine Dragons, Santana, Dead and Company and dozens of others on the bill. But from the start, Woodstock 50 drew skepticism throughout the music industry. The lineup was announced in March, later than expected, and one of the headliners, the Black Keys, soon dropped out. The announced date for the start of ticket sales came and went, with no tickets and a red flag: The festival was still awaiting necessary permits from state and local authorities. Yet as soon as Dentsu pulled its support, Lang insisted that the show would go on, somehow. He even brought in the big legal guns. In a statement on Tuesday directed at the industry, the festival’s lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz — who also represents President Trump — said that Dentsu did not have the right to cancel the festival, and instructed “all stakeholders, including the entertainers,” to proceed as planned. (Dentsu has declined to make any further comment.) Still, many artist representatives have expressed grave doubts about the festival’s future, and chatter in the industry has already equated Woodstock 50 with the Fyre Festival — whose collapse in 2017 was so publicly disastrous that two documentaries were made about it. “It seems to be doomed for this year,” said Marsha Vlasic, a veteran talent agent whose client Cage the Elephant was booked for the festival. On Wednesday, Lang spoke to The New York Times about how he proposes to keep his festival alive, and what went on behind the scenes with Dentsu, which he said was the only investor. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You’ve insisted that Woodstock 50 will go on. What do you need, financially and otherwise, to do that without Dentsu? We need to replace them financially. Frankly, I think it will be a much easier process going forward, because all that baggage gets left behind. We are a few days away from permits; we are in talks with investors who are anxious to come in. The clock is ticking. How quickly does this need to be done? Believe me, I know. [Laughs.] We have a short window to put this back together. That’s obvious. We feel it’s enough time, and there is enough interest, that we think we will accomplish it. Do you have sponsors? We have potential sponsors, yes. Most of the sponsors ultimately were brought in through Concept One Communications, which is another partner to the deal, so we feel that that’s secure. Did you get any more information from Dentsu about why they pulled out? We really didn’t. The surprising thing was that they didn’t give us a heads up, or call, or say, “We’d like to back away, can you replace us?” It was just a surprise. It’s mind-boggling, in fact. Dentsu felt that production deadlines were not met, and that the capacity had been reduced too much from what was originally planned — from 100,000 people to 75,000. Do you have a response to that? We were definitely pushing initially for more than that. In researching the site more minutely, and assessing the surrounding properties that we thought would be available, we were looking for more than 100,000. But we were willing to go at 100,000, which we feel that the site can handle well. It went down to 75,000 quite a while ago. Dentsu felt that’s the number they wanted to go with. And they pushed us to agree to that number, which surprised me, because it’s not in everybody’s interest to go smaller. But nonetheless, we went along with it, and that’s been the case for months; that’s not a new circumstance that would set this off. So they agreed to 75,000? Not only did they agree to it, they kind of insisted on it. When you announced this festival, there was skepticism that you could compete with big events like Coachella and Bonnaroo. Now there is doubt that you can continue at all. How will you overcome that? The best way to overcome that is for us to get on sale, and that’s the objective now. The talent has been solid for a couple of months now. They’ve been completely paid. All of them? Yeah, all of them. So moving forward for us is finishing up the permit application, which the state and the county have been really helpful with, and should be doable in just a few days. And then to go on sale. What about the public? How do you get their confidence back? The best way to turn things around is by your actions, not by your words. So again, it’s getting on sale. I put out a letter last night to all the people who have emailed us, just to explain what is going on. The response has been great. People are being really supportive. Everybody is giving us the best of wishes, and “go get ’em” kind of stuff. And we will deliver. I know that in this day and age when things are so buttoned down, and the industry is so buttoned down, this is kind of an oddity. But things happen when you are committed and have a purpose, and we are getting a lot of heartfelt support out there. The last Woodstock festival, in 1999, ended with riots and reports of sexual assault. Now the 50th anniversary event is in doubt. What do you think this is going to do to Woodstock’s legacy? Funnily enough, this kind of fits the legacy of Woodstock in a way. In 1969, we got kicked out of Wallkill a month before the festival was to happen. One of the miracles was that we found a site the next day. Woodstock is kind of about … I don’t know how describe it other than that it’s just about commitment. We’re committed. We were committed then, and we’re not stopping now.",The New York Times
2019,"With an Ax Hovering, Don Mattingly Savors His Time as Marlins Manager","PHILADELPHIA — In his 40 years in baseball, Don Mattingly has experienced it all, from the dizzying heights — a Most Valuable Player Award at 24 — to the lowest depths — a rapid plummet as injuries prematurely ended his playing career with the Yankees. These days, Mattingly must draw from that spectrum of success and struggle as he manages the Miami Marlins, a raw team undergoing a complete rebuild. Mattingly is in the final year of the four-year deal he signed under a previous ownership group. It is a huge change from his time managing the Los Angeles Dodgers, as Joe Torre’s successor, and serving as Torre’s bench coach with the Yankees. Both of those teams had bountiful payrolls and a regular presence in the postseason. His Marlins have the worst record in the majors, 10-27 as of Thursday, and the worst attendance figures, drawing the ire of Derek Jeter, the team’s chief executive and a part owner, who recently said that “everyone knows we’re better than this.” Just weeks into the season, the team fired batting coach Mike Pagliarulo, Mattingly’s old Yankees teammate. But if anything, Mattingly seems energized by starting over again, vital for someone working with a young team at the margins. The stakes are as different as possible from those in his last job: Replacing Torre, he managed the Dodgers to three straight division titles before he was fired. He now has a chance to mold a team in his own image. “My first couple of years here were one thing. My last couple it’s like a whole new thing,” Mattingly said, sitting in the dugout on a recent afternoon, looking much the same, a week after turning 58, as he did decades ago in a Yankees uniform. “It’s almost like a new job. You keep moving forward in this game. You try to get better every day. You prepare for that next game. The ones behind you are gone.” The same approach helped bring Mattingly the kind of success in baseball that few have tasted: nine Gold Gloves at first base, a .343 average to win a batting title at age 23, the M.V.P. award a year later and a season for the ages at 25, when he hit .352 with nearly as many home runs (31) as strikeouts (35). Mattingly’s dominance ended when back injuries took hold. And the Yankees went into a downward spiral, bottoming out in 1990 as the American League’s worst team. He lasted through the team’s rebirth, making his first trip to the playoffs in 1995, his final season. He was just 34. Mattingly has yet to appear in the World Series: The Yankees won it the year after he retired, and their string of annual appearances ended before he became Torre’s bench coach; the Dodgers made it two seasons after he left. He has had four decades of tomorrows in the game, and yet he exuded an unmistakable energy as he bounded out of the clubhouse and onto the field. He settled into a chair set up on the field, getting to his national television pregame interview before the host or the camera operator, ready to throw out phrases like “We’ve been in games” and “He’s just evolving for me” — the language of rebuilds. Things looked more promising when he arrived. Mattingly’s first Marlins team finished 79-82 in 2016, with a core of young hitters — J.T. Realmuto, Christian Yelich, Marcell Ozuna and Giancarlo Stanton, none of them older than 26 — and an electrifying 23-year-old pitcher, Jose Fernandez. They seemed ready to dominate for the next decade. But Fernandez died in a boating accident that fall, and when the Marlins were sold, the new ownership decided to start over. Realmuto is now a Phillie, Stanton a Yankee, Ozuna a Cardinal, Yelich, the reigning National League M.V.P., a Brewer. All were traded to restock a farm system and build the Marlins into a contender several years from now. The centerpiece of the Yelich trade, center fielder Lewis Brinson, 25, has been disappointing, hitting .199 since joining the Marlins. He is now in the minors. The team’s new elder statesman, Curtis Granderson, 38, hasn’t made much impact on the field. He was hitting .168 before the weekend. A rare bright spot is starting pitcher Caleb Smith, who is 3-0 with an earned run average of 2.11. Despite Mattingly’s résumé — his experience with the Yankees and Dodgers, franchises that don’t settle for anything less than World Series trophies — somehow the Marlins seem like a better fit for him. Any reckoning of the playing careers of current major league managers would place Mattingly well ahead of everyone else, all due respect to Ron Gardenhire’s .232 career batting average. Yet Mattingly sees his career as slow-blooming, formed not when all of New York adored him, but when he lasted until the 19th round of the 1979 draft and then set about proving himself, taking four full seasons to reach the major leagues. In other words, he knows the meaning of incremental growth. “I had to work my way through,” Mattingly said. “I had to hit my way to the big leagues. And so I know how hard it is to get here. And how you have to improve, and you have to get better all the time. And you just never forget that.” Mattingly is going through early fatherhood all over again. He has six boys, four grown; the youngest, Louis, is 4. That means Mattingly can relate to his young players, knowing with immediacy what they are going through when they have children. Three weeks later, he checks to see if they’re getting any sleep. He is adapting to a lot these days, savoring changes in the game. So his Marlins, far from lagging on the analytics side, currently lead the majors in infield shifts. “The evolution of the game and everything that’s happened, from launch angle to shifts, all that stuff — that helps you,” Mattingly said, adding: “It’s invigorating to keep learning. You don’t want to get to the point where you’re just like, ‘Ugh, this game. What are they doing?’” Mattingly said he would be at peace with whatever the Marlins decide when his contract expires at the end of the season. “And if I’m here or I’m not here, this is going to be a good place to be,” Mattingly said. “It is. It’s going to be good from the minor leagues on up.”",The New York Times
2019,"With the 2020 Democratic Field Set, Candidates Begin the Races Within the Race","NEWTON, Iowa — Joseph R. Biden Jr. has built an early lead in the month since he entered the presidential campaign, confidently projecting himself as the Democratic front-runner and the candidate best positioned to defeat President Trump. But beneath the surface of a seemingly placid race is a much more volatile contest, as a series of primaries-within-the-primary unfold along lines that reflect some of the most animating forces in the Trump era: race, gender, age and ideology. With a historically large field of 23 candidates apparently now set, Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both African-American, are competing with Mr. Biden and other candidates for the support of black voters; Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke, who are both under 50, are vying for the mantle of generational change; Senator Elizabeth Warren is encroaching on Senator Bernie Sanders’s support from the party’s left wing; and six women are making the case that it is long past time for a female president. As the first debates loom next month and candidates begin to test initial attacks on Mr. Biden, and one another, these miniature races will help clarify who might emerge as the most formidable alternative to the former vice president. As Mr. Trump demonstrated in 2016, initial assumptions about who primary voters will and will not support can prove foolhardy. “It’s easy for those of us who are deeply involved in the process to get so wrapped up in it that we forget just how many people will tune in for this very late in the calendar year,” said Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who like other candidates spent the Memorial Day weekend campaigning. Referring to Mr. Sanders, he said that other than “the more ideological candidates” nobody’s “support is consolidated at this point.” Mr. Biden, hoping to stay above the fray of the primary, has found success ignoring his rival candidates and putting Mr. Trump at the center of his campaign. He is keeping a notably light schedule and carefully avoiding political risks. At a moment when many in his party are shaped by the post-traumatic stress lingering from 2016, Mr. Biden’s implicit message, that he can win, carries significant appeal. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.] However, interviews with dozens of party leaders and strategists revealed a far more fluid race than Mr. Biden’s double-digit polling advantage would indicate, especially in the early-nominating states where so many Democratic races had been upended over the years. “My party doesn’t like front-runners,” said Paul Begala, the former top adviser to former President Bill Clinton, noting that nearly every Democratic favorite in recent history either lost the nomination or suffered a scare along the way. “It’s going to tighten no matter what.” Democrats say that is in part because much of the party’s energy is coming from younger, female and progressive activists, making it unlikely that a 76-year-old, establishment-aligned white male will simply march to the nomination. And while Mr. Biden has benefited so far from the sprawling field, which has split the opposition, there are already signs that he could face stiffer competition. In the race to become the progressive alternative to Mr. Biden, multiple polls indicate that Ms. Warren is gaining on Mr. Sanders, the other septuagenarian in the race who is running second in most surveys. And while she has so far declined to take on the Vermont senator by name, Ms. Warren has repeatedly appeared together in recent days with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a galvanizing force among progressives, sending an unmistakable signal that she intends to pursue Mr. Sanders’s left-wing base. There are also indications that many in the party would prefer a woman to be their standard-bearer: 31 percent of Democrats surveyed in a new Pew poll said they would be “more enthusiastic” about a female nominee, a number that rose to 45 percent among Democratic women under the age of 50. And in a new poll from Monmouth University taken after a series of state abortion bans, three women — Ms. Warren, Ms. Harris and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — are building support. Claire Celsi, an Iowa state senator, said she had narrowed her choices to the women in the race. “I see the brilliance in all the female candidates and I want to shine a little light on that,” Ms. Celsi said. “Because of what happened to Hillary Clinton I feel like I owe them that.” She has already met privately with five of the six female candidates, had phone calls with Ms. Harris’s husband and influential sister and next month will sit at Ms. Harris’s table during a major fund-raising dinner for the Iowa Democratic Party. Indeed, no other state better illustrates the volatility of the primary than Iowa, where the contours of the last three Democratic caucuses have changed late in the race, most notably when Barack Obama thrashed Ms. Clinton in 2008, jump-starting his rise to the nomination. Appearing Friday at a house party in Newton, just east of Des Moines, Mr. Booker warned Iowa Democrats not to seek “a savior in this election” and said that 2020 must be about something bigger than simply unseating Mr. Trump — unmistakable references to Mr. Biden and his message. In a brief interview after the event, Mr. Booker recalled that Mr. Trump himself had said that he alone could successfully confront the country’s challenges. “We have to resist the temptation to project upon one candidate the solving of all of our problems,” Mr. Booker said. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are knotted together above the rest of the field right now, according to public and private polls, but at this time in 2015 Ms. Clinton had led Mr. Sanders by 41 points in a Des Moines Register poll. She would eke out victory by less than a single point. “There is a long way to go and at this point no one thought that a peanut farmer from Georgia was going to be president, or that a governor from Arkansas was going to win or that a guy named Barack Obama was going to be able to capture the White House,” Ms. Klobuchar said. Voters like Linda Wormley make clear that it is folly to assume the two current Iowa leaders will remain as such next February. Ms. Wormley, a retiree who attended Mr. Booker’s house party, said she had a list of six potential candidates to support, but instead of identifying them she mentioned the two contenders she had ruled out: Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. “I’m open to the women and a couple of the men,” said Ms. Wormley, who invoked the House speaker to argue that a woman would have the best chance to rattle Mr. Trump. “Look at what Pelosi has done to him,” she said. [Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.] While Mr. Biden enjoys significant good will in Iowa, organization is crucial to success in the caucuses, and he is only now building an operation while some of his rivals have already put in place a more substantial infrastructure. “He’s going to have to pick up the organization,” said Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor. “It requires a lot of people and Warren has lots of people on the ground and they’re good.” The most engaged Iowa activists see a more wide-open race than polls indicate, with the female contenders as well as Mr. Buttigieg drawing frequent mention. “It seems the press and perhaps the party have landed on Biden as the top contender, when Harris, Buttigieg and others are quite popular with the Democrats I know,” said Marjie Foster, the party chairwoman in Decatur County. “We are scratching our heads a bit at the polling information because it truly doesn’t seem to reflect how the majority of my sphere of influence feels.” Sean Bagniewski, the party chairman in Polk County, which includes Des Moines and represents about 20 percent of the state’s Democrats, said the vast field was prompting many Democrats to take their time. “Instead of having one favorite or two favorites, people have three to five favorites,” Mr. Bagniewski said. “Other than people working for the candidates, I know less than 10 people who have made up their minds.” Perhaps no subject is touchier in the Democratic contest than the age of the two front-runners. It comes up repeatedly, if politely, in conversations with voters. And the issue was on vivid display in the new Pew poll, which asked voters the ideal age for their nominee: just three percent said somebody in their 70s and only six percent said a candidate in their 30s (Mr. Buttigieg is 37). For now, Mr. Biden, who has vowed to restore dignity to government and forge consensus in Washington, is dominating the field among older voters. “That’s a reaction to the fact that folks my age don’t like the tone and content from this president,” said Mr. Vilsack, who is 69. “They want some stability, they want an adult in the room who’s tough enough to beat President Trump.” But younger voters, said Bryce Smith, the Democratic chairman in Dallas County, “are saying the wheel is totally dismantled and we need to reinvent and rebuild the wheel.” The generational divide, Mr. Smith predicted, would be “the biggest division in my eyes leading into the caucus and primary season.” Terry Kocher, the party chairman in Humboldt County in northwest Iowa, said he donated to Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign after being impressed with his “calmness, intelligence, poise and wit during interviews.” “It is time for the torch to be passed,” he said. “To have someone who looks more like you, talks more like you and better understands how you feel is what will drive us to victory for years to come.” That sentiment was evident as Mr. Booker left the home of Fritz and Carol Kramer Friday afternoon. Ms. Kramer said she was excited about him and Ms. Harris. “A lot of my older friends really like Joe because they think he can beat Trump and they like him because they knew him,” she said. “And he is a good person — but I’m still wanting some young people and people of color.”",The New York Times
2019,"With ‘NOS4A2,’ Joe Hill Finally Sinks His Teeth Into TV","The AMC horror series is one of several adaptations the best-selling horror author (and son of Stephen King) has in the works, after multiple stalled attempts. On a sunny spring morning in a hotel near Central Park, the writer Joe Hill settled into an overstuffed chair before an 18th-century-style fireplace, received tea and sandwiches — rectangular, crusts removed — and stroked his graying beard. He was there to talk about a vile old man with rotten teeth who feasts on the souls of young children. The contrast was one he seemed to relish, with self-awareness. “The tea I’m drinking is called Mystical Creatures, which is a little bit on the nose for today’s themes,” he said. “But we’ll roll with it.” Those themes, in no particular order, included: vampirism; feminism; supernaturalism; sadism; his father, the best-selling novelist Stephen King; and his own best-selling novel “NOS4A2,” which has been developed into a TV series that debuts Sunday on AMC. An update to the classic vampire tale (the title is a play on “Nosferatu”), the series follows a supernaturally gifted young heroine from a broken New England home and her battles against the villain Charlie Manx, who carries children off in a demonic Rolls-Royce to a terrifying place called Christmasland. “NOS4A2” is both the first of Hill’s stories to make it to the small screen and one of several TV projects he now has in the works, a dramatic reversal of fortune after multiple stalled attempts. Misfires included a reboot of George A. Romero’s horror series “Tales From the Darkside,” which never made it past the pilot stage after Hill wrote several scripts, and two adaptations of “Locke & Key,” a comic Hill did with the artist Gabriel Rodríguez. Separate pilots were produced for each — first for Fox, then for Hulu — but both were dropped. Then suddenly, abundance: In addition to “NOS4A2,” “Locke & Key” was finally picked up for a Netflix series, which is expected to debut by early next year. A Netflix film based on “In the Tall Grass,” a short story Hill wrote with his father, is expected this fall. And in a development that completes a personal circle for Hill, the streaming service Shudder is in postproduction on an adaptation of his 2014 short story “By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain” for its anthology series “Creepshow,” a reboot of the 1982 movie written by King — which also starred Hill as a little boy. “I feel like I’ve had a real lucky run,” he said. “But it’s kind of a gold rush, right?” Networks and streaming services were now “vacuuming up books and comic books and short stories,” he argued, which presented new opportunities for writers who worked with “suspense and high concepts.” “We’ll see how long it lasts,” he added. “Probably until the environmental apocalypse finishes us all off.” “NOS4A2” traveled a comparatively straightforward path to TV. Published in 2013, the novel was an immediate best seller; by 2015, it had found its way to AMC, which has made horror a core part of its programming. “The Walking Dead” remains one of TV’s most popular shows, and a spinoff, “Fear the Walking Dead,” begins its fifth season Sunday as the lead-in for “NOS4A2.” This summer AMC will present a second season of its well-received anthology series “The Terror,” which brings supernatural horror to historical settings. Screen adaptations of sprawling stories are, of course, a tradition in Hill’s family. Dozens of his father’s stories have been adapted, many into classics, like “Carrie,” “The Dead Zone” and “The Shawshank Redemption.” Others, like “Maximum Overdrive” and “The Lawnmower Man” … weren’t so classic. (AMC is also developing a pilot script based on “Sleeping Beauties,” a novel written by Stephen and Owen King, Hill’s brother.) Hill said his father had offered some good advice about the vicissitudes of having one’s work adapted, a process over which the writer often has little control once the rights are sold. “He’d say, ‘If someone takes one of my novels and makes a brilliant movie, it doesn’t make my novel one word better,’” Hill said. The important thing, King told him, was to “be working on the next book.” As valuable as it was to have the world’s most famous living horror writer for a father, Hill was determined to succeed on his own merits. “I knew by the time I was 12 that I really wanted to make stuff up for a living,” he said. Still, he “was deeply insecure” about being taken seriously. “I needed to feel like when I got published, I got published for the right reasons,” he said. Hence the pseudonym, which Hill adopted in college — a shortening of his full name, Joseph Hillstrom King. (That’s not to say there is no family loyalty: Of Stanley Kubrick’s revered adaptation of “The Shining,” which King hated, Hill said, “It has an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson, which makes it easy to ignore how lousy the rest of the picture is.”) After early attempts to separate himself even further — writing what he called “New Yorker-type stories about divorce and difficult children and middle-age ennui” — he soon realized that the stories “had no inner life.” Once he embraced the uncanny storytelling he had always loved, success soon followed, including several best-selling novels. (His identity was officially outed by Variety in 2006.) “NOS4A2,” Hill’s third novel, was an obvious fit for television, said David Madden, the president of programing for AMC’s entertainment networks. Madden believed that recent years had seen a deepening interest in what he called “immersive horror,” with its longer arcs and detailed character building. “I don’t think you could have compressed it into an hour and 45 minutes and done it any version of justice,” Madden said. (Hill’s second novel, “Horns,” was made into a movie, released in 2014 to middling reviews.) Still, the world of “NOS4A2” required some compression, even though the 10 hourlong episodes of Season 1 cover only one-third of the novel. The protagonist Vic McQueen is 8 when the novel begins; in the series, she’s a high school senior with a dirt bike. And much of Manx’s back story was drawn from Hill’s spinoff graphic novel, “Wraith,” named for the model of Manx’s 1938 Rolls-Royce. “You really begin to understand what a horrific upbringing Charlie had as a child — how abandoned, how neglected, how abused he was,” said Zachary Quinto, who took the role partly because he was drawn to its moral complexity. “It really gave me a lot to understand that, no, I don’t think he is pure evil. I just think he’s someone who seriously lost his way.” Jami O’Brien, the series’s showrunner and head writer, said that Hill had been very hands-off with the adaptation, letting her do what she needed to bring the story into a different medium. But the two swapped insights. “We did have lots of conversations about tone, about voice,” she said. “I remember the first conversation I had with him he said to me, ‘There’s nothing scarier than a candy cane in July.’ And I held onto that throughout as a way to think about the scary parts of the show.” They agreed that the female perspective of the young protagonists should drive the production: The writers’ room was deliberately staffed with mostly women. Kari Skogland, who directed several episodes of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” was hired to direct the first two for “NOS4A2,” an attempt to “set our tone out of the gate,” O’Brien said. Compressing the story also let O’Brien confine Vic’s portrayal to a single actress. Ashleigh Cummings (“Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries”), who plays Vic, said she had been drawn to the character in part because she relied on powers other than the traditionally masculine ones valued in most superheroines. It was important, she said, to “broaden the scope of the term ‘strength’ to include qualities that have been typically attributed as female.” “She does have the courage and bravery that you see in superheroine females, but her strongest muscle is actually her heart,” Cummings said. “And her superpowers are her creativity, her intuition, her empathy, her vulnerability.” It seemed important to Hill that his brand of horror should convey that depth of character, beyond the blood and guts. (Though the story has plenty of that, too.) Television was great for that, he noted, because a viewer could really fall in love with the characters over many weeks and months, and thus come to root for them. “I think some people think horror is about sadism; it’s about flinging intestines at the camera,” he said. “And some is. And I like some of that stuff. But I do think the really effective horror is about empathy.”",The New York Times
2019,Witnessing the Holocaust,"“We all know the who, what, when and where of the Holocaust, but the why is a mystery still,” an archivist said. “If you can get bystander photos, that explains a little bit of the why.” AMSTERDAM — Two teacups sit on the windowsill of an Amsterdam apartment. Behind them, out the window and across the street, can be seen a blurry crowd of men, women and children who stand nervously, with bags packed on the sidewalk. It is June 1943, and this is a photograph of Jews who have been rounded up and are awaiting deportation to Nazi concentration and death camps. Who took this photograph, and why? Taking a snapshot like this could have resulted in arrest for someone during the German occupation of the Netherlands. But still, Dutch citizens took them as they witnessed their Jewish neighbors being forcibly removed from their homes, put on trains and sent to camps, where 104,000 were killed. “Teacups” is one of the disturbing images in an exhibition called “Persecution of the Jews in Photographs: The Netherlands, 1940-1945” that runs through Oct. 6 at the National Holocaust Museum in Amsterdam. The display will then move to the Topographie des Terrors, a documentation center in Berlin, from late October to April 2020. René Kok and Erik Somers, World War II researchers at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam, spent eight years assembling some 400 photographs for a book on the subject, and along the way, they decided to present a selection of them in exhibition form. “People are so moved by these two innocent teacups,” Mr. Kok said in an interview. “Those people who took that image were very nervous.” The researchers were able to identify many of the details about the photographed raid and some of those pictured, who were sent to the Westerbork transit camp that day, but the identity of the photographer remains a mystery. Mr. Somers said in an interview that most of the images of Jewish persecution that had previously been exhibited were taken by those doing the persecuting: Nazi occupiers documented their activities for leaders in Germany, while Nazi sympathizers used photographs of Jewish people to accompany articles in decidedly anti-Semitic pamphlets. The exhibition in Amsterdam presents such images, but it also offers photographs by bystanders, school and wedding pictures, and a handful of shots by professional Jewish photographers in hiding, such as Maria Austria and Henk Jonkers, who documented what they could. Judith Cohen, director of the photography archive at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, said in a telephone interview that bystanders’ pictures spoke to one of the main questions about the murder of Jews in the 1940s. “We all know the who, what, when and where of the Holocaust, but the why is a mystery still,” she said. “The why is, ‘What were ordinary people thinking? What were they doing?’ If you can get bystander photos, that explains a little bit of the why.” One of the most moving images in the exhibition is a portrait of children, ages 4 to 17, taken in the courtyard of a Jewish school in the Dutch city of Deventer in September 1942. All the children over 6 are wearing the Star of David on their clothes. The photograph was lost for decades, covered up when its frame was used for a painting. In 1998, the painting was removed from the frame to reveal the group portrait underneath. An organization in Deventer then did extensive research to identify the children. Only one of them is believed to have survived the war. The images in the show span the early days of the occupation through the horrifying denouement of the war. In the summer of 1942, a professional photographer took a portrait of his neighbor, Vrouwtje Blitz-Kleinkramer, then 76, seated in front of her house on a wooden bench. The only ominous sign is a Star of David stitched into her dress. Within two months, on Sept. 14, 1942, Ms. Blitz-Kleinkramer and her husband would be murdered in Auschwitz. Many of the photographs feature people going about ordinary lives, walking through the central Dam Square in Amsterdam or riding bicycles past the Rijksmuseum. Looking at the images now can give the viewer a chilling feeling of impending doom. But, Ms. Cohen said, “It’s important not to read history backwards.” “We must keep in mind that nobody knew how it would end,” she said, “so for a long time, people thought, as bad as it is that we have to wear Jewish stars, we might go on with daily life.” But, she added, “Once Jews were being rounded up, you didn’t want to be photographed because that would be a death sentence.” Only four witness photographs are known to exist of the Nazi extermination camps, and they were taken in August 1944 at Auschwitz-Birkenau, most probably by a Greek prisoner, Alberto Errera, who was later killed by a guard. The negatives were smuggled out of the camp in a tube of toothpaste. No one knows how Mr. Errera got the camera, and the images are blurry, shot hastily at an angle. They show naked women and burning piles of dead bodies. A controversy erupted in the Dutch news media about the images, after Emile Schrijver, the general director of the organization that runs the National Holocaust Museum and other Jewish cultural sites in Amsterdam, decided that the photographs would not be included in the show, an exclusion that Mr. Kok and Mr. Somers, the NIOD researchers, opposed. Mr. Schrijver said in an interview that the photographs did not fit in an exhibition focused on the persecution of Dutch Jews, because the subjects were known to be from Hungary. Three of the four photographs are also already on display across the street at the Hollandsche Schouwburg, a Holocaust memorial, where they are part of a larger exhibit that explores brutal, humiliating or otherwise difficult imagery of the mass extermination. “If we are going to show images like these, the context has to be 100 percent historically correct,” Mr. Schrijver said. “We’re not afraid to show them, but we feel we show them in the context that we believe is necessary, which also contains a discussion on how to deal with them.” The images will be included when the exhibition moves to Berlin. The Amsterdam iteration does have another image, perhaps even more harrowing, of a 7-year-old boy walking past hundreds of emaciated, dead bodies near the entry of Bergen-Belsen, shot by the English war photographer George Rodger just after the British liberated the concentration camp in April 1945. After the image was published, the boy was identified as Simon “Sieg” Maandag, an Amsterdammer, by his uncle, who was in New York. The photograph led to the reunification of Sieg with his mother and sister, who had also survived the war.",The New York Times
2019,Woman Convicted in Kim Jong-nam’s Killing Is Freed in Malaysia,"BANGKOK — A Vietnamese woman who was the only person convicted in the bold assassination of Kim Jong-un’s elder half brother, Kim Jong-nam, was released on Friday after serving 27 months in a Malaysian prison. The release of Doan Thi Huong, 30, brings an end to the legal case in the murder of Mr. Kim, who died in February 2017 after two women smeared VX nerve agent on his face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The use of a severely toxic military weapon in such a public assassination was highly unusual. An Indonesian woman arrested in the case, Siti Aisyah, 27, was released in March after high-level appeals by the Indonesian government to free her. The police have identified at least seven North Koreans suspected of involvement in the killing, but none of them were ever brought to trial. Four escaped Malaysia immediately after the attack, and three others were allowed to leave after Pyongyang blocked Malaysian diplomats from leaving North Korea. The North Korean government denied any involvement in the killing, but the country’s ruler, Kim Jong-un, was widely believed to have ordered it. Kim Jong-nam, who was never fully accepted by the ruling family in North Korea, lived much of his life wandering abroad, in Europe and Asia. After Ms. Siti’s release, Ms. Huong was allowed to plead guilty to a charge of causing bodily harm and sentenced to 40 months in prison. She received a standard sentence reduction and credit for time served while awaiting trial. At the Kuala Lumpur airport on Friday afternoon, before Ms. Huong’s departure for Hanoi, her lawyers released a letter she had written by hand in English, thanking the governments of Malaysia and Vietnam, her lawyers, the news media and her jailers, who she said had taken good care of her. “I’m very happy and thank you all a lot. I love you all,” she wrote, drawing a small heart. One of her lawyers, Hisham Teh, said he did not expect any further legal action in Ms. Huong’s case. “The case has come to a complete end as far as Doan is concerned,” he said. Ms. Huong and Ms. Siti, who did not know each other before the attack, said they had no intention of killing Mr. Kim and had been tricked by North Korean agents into thinking that they were participating in a harmless prank for a television reality show. Mr. Hisham described Ms. Huong as “naïve and gullible.” In accepting her plea to a lesser offense, the judge in the case, Azmi Ariffin, told Ms. Huong that she was “a very lucky person.” She had faced the death penalty if convicted of Mr. Kim’s murder.",The New York Times
2019,"Woman Convicted of Forcing Sri Lankan to Work Without Pay, and Marrying Her to Keep Her in U.S.","A New Jersey woman was convicted Thursday of forcing a Sri Lankan woman to work without pay for nine years, causing her to overstay her visa, and marrying her in an attempt to keep her in the country. A jury found the defendant, Alia Imad Faleh Al Hunaity, 43, guilty on charges of forced labor, alien harboring for financial gain and marriage fraud. The jury had deliberated for two hours after a six-day trial before Judge Robert B. Kugler of the United States District Court in Camden. Prosecutors did not name the victim, who they said took care of the woman’s children and cleaned her house, and was largely hidden from the outside world. They said she came to the United States on a temporary visa in 2009. “The defendant in this case treated the victim as a slave,” United States Attorney Craig Carpenito said in a statement from the Justice Department. “Al-Hunaity kept the victim in this country illegally and hid her away, in order to force her to perform household work for Al-Hunaity without pay, privacy, or the ability to move about freely.” Robert Kovic, a lawyer for Ms. Al-Hunaity, said that he and his client contested the claims made by the prosecution. “The evidence presented was nowhere near proving the government’s claims,” he said in an email, adding that the prosecutors’ claims were rejected “not only by Ms. Hunaity, but also by the alleged victim herself.” In court documents, federal prosecutors said that Ms. Al-Hunaity, a naturalized United States citizen from Jordan, was divorced from the father of her children. They said the victim had worked for Ms. Al-Hunaity’s parents in Jordan before coming to the United States. “Hunaity forced the victim to cook and clean her homes in Woodland Park and Secaucus, New Jersey, and to care for her three children, all without pay,” the Justice Department said in its statement. “She further limited the victim’s interactions with the world outside of Hunaity’s homes. During this time, Hunaity required the victim to sleep on a bed in a public space in Hunaity’s homes, including in the kitchen.” Ms. Al-Hunaity will be sentenced on Sept. 4. The forced labor charge carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.",The New York Times

2019,"Women Hockey Players, Seeking a Better League, Say They’ll Sit Out","After the Canadian Women’s Hockey League folded on Wednesday, North America was left with one professional option for female hockey players, the National Women’s Hockey League. But on Thursday, many of the game’s top players announced that they would sit out the coming professional season rather than join the N.W.H.L. in an effort to spur better working conditions for their sport and pressure the N.H.L. to fully back women’s hockey. Monique Lamoureux-Morando, Meghan Duggan, Brianne Jenner and many other American and Canadian Olympians shared a message on social media Thursday morning, stating that, “it is time to create a sustainable professional league for Women’s Hockey,” saying a lack of health insurance and salaries as low as $2,000 a season make adequate training and preparation impossible. “Because of that, together as players, we will not play in ANY professional leagues in North America this season until we get the resources that professional hockey demands and deserves,” the statement continued. More than 200 players have reportedly backed the decree, which used the hashtag #ForTheGame. A full list of players involved has not been made public, although Liz Knox, a chairwoman of the C.W.H.L. Players’ Association, estimated 98 percent of her former league’s almost 150 players were on board. Lamoureux-Morando and Jenner added that they had support from players from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Denmark. The N.W.H.L. released a statement Thursday afternoon saying it will increase salaries next season and evenly split revenue from league-level sponsorships and media rights deals. They also said the league had raised significant investments since the C.W.H.L. ceased operations, although details of these financial developments were not disclosed. Thursday’s decision echoes a move by the United States women’s national team in March 2017, when they threatened to boycott a world championship tournament until they received more equitable support from USA Hockey, their governing body. Social media was a key tool in spreading their message, which ended with increased salary, medical and travel benefits. “It’s a scary step, but in order to make big changes, we had to do something that’s bold,” Jenner said. Duggan and Lamoureux-Morando, vocal leaders of that movement, said that a group of American and Canadian stars had been discussing the best course for women’s pro hockey almost a year before the C.W.H.L. ceased operations, beginning shortly after the rivals played a thrilling Olympic gold medal final that elevated the sport to unforeseen popularity. The N.W.H.L. is in a perilous spot after beginning plans to add two Canadian teams to their core of five American franchises in light of the C.W.H.L.’s closure. Many United States national team members played in the N.W.H.L. but were disgruntled after the league cut salaries during its 2016-17 season. Lamoureux-Morando, who did not play in the league, said women’s pro players should not accept earning less than $25,000. Knox, who also posted on Twitter her support for sitting out this season, said discussions with the N.W.H.L.’s players association broke down over issues like job security and health insurance. “We’re not trying to harm anybody doing this or take down any businesses, we just say we deserve better,” Knox said. “We want a seat on the table and felt we didn’t have it in either of the leagues. Without us there is no league. If we’re serious about this, let’s do it right.” Anya Battaglino, the director of the N.W.H.L.’s players’ association, held several calls with the Canadian league’s counterpart in recent weeks. She said that Thursday’s announcement was frustrating and counterproductive and that the players did not make their demands clear to her. “My goal in unifying with them was to understand what their needs and wants were, to better accommodate,” Battaglino said. “If they say we want full transparency on league books, that’s not something I can do and I’m handcuffed. It’s a privately held business. ” Battaglino, who said she would be willing to keep dialogue open with the Canadian league’s players association, said that she was confident that the N.W.H.L. would have many returning players and that the league would grow in its fifth season. The N.W.H.L. has received increased funding from the N.H.L. since the end of last season, but the most powerful entity in hockey has repeatedly voiced its intent to not enter the women’s pro hockey world while other leagues are in operation. Bill Daly, deputy commissioner of the N.H.L., wrote in an email that this sentiment had not really changed with Thursday’s news, and that “We would need to know a lot more before taking any affirmative position.” However, with so many players uniting, the N.H.L. may be hard-pressed to stay on the sideline. Knox added that she hoped that USA Hockey and Hockey Canada would also take stronger stances in supporting the best competitive environments for women’s hockey players. Mary Kay-Messier, vice president for marketing at Bauer Hockey, a leading equipment supplier, also called on the N.H.L. to become more active “We’ve seen the same statements everyone has seen,” Duggan said. “But I find confidence in those statements and I trust and support they do have a vision for women’s hockey. We’re looking for a long-term vision with a sustainable business model with expertise, transparency, proper resources and treatment of players.” Lamoureux-Morando added, “I don’t think the wheel has to be reinvented to create this league.”",The New York Times
2019,"Women Onstage, Not Getting What They Want","London Theater Reviews LONDON — Sally Field wears anxiety like a layer of clothing she can’t shed in the Old Vic’s revival of “All My Sons,” the latest in a number of plays by Arthur Miller onstage here, and the starriest, too. Running through June 8, the production will be shown in movie theaters around the world via National Theater Live on May 14. Alongside the admirable and avuncular Bill Pullman, Ms. Field grabs a sometimes labored play by the scruff of its neck and ensures that “attention must be paid.” (That’s to quote from another forlorn Miller wife, in a later play, “Death of a Salesman,” currently playing down the road at the Young Vic. That one is notable for having an almost all-black cast.) In “All My Sons,” Ms. Field proves once more that an actress long feted for her work in films and on TV possesses real theatrical mettle. Playing Kate Keller, a housewife adrift in a family dogged by deceit, the double Oscar winner combines fear with restlessness and tenderness alongside an overwhelming sense of denial. She and Mr. Pullman’s Joe lost one of their two sons in World War II, and Kate lives daily with the self-deluded prospect that he might yet return to them. At the same time, Joe must grapple with the shame that he let a business partner take the blame for manufacturing faulty parts that led to the deaths of 21 pilots during the war. Joe wants to put this grievous episode behind him, but Miller, like his adored Ibsen before him, shows how the past can’t help but invade the present. Mr. Pullman conveys a sense of a man trying not to implode, but, in this production by the director Jeremy Herrin, Kate is the play’s tremulous pulse. A concurrent Broadway revival of this same play is dominated by the Tony nominee Annette Bening, in much the same way as Ms. Field commands the stage in London. In the West End, the Keller family feels quite ordinary, but on Broadway, the family seems somewhat grander, more imposing. Both approaches have their strengths, and when Ms. Field beats against Mr. Pullman’s chest in distress, you sense a good woman hollowed out by the moral decay amid which her every day has become a living death. If “All My Sons” showcases its stars rather than re-evaluating the play, the opposite is true of the director Rebecca Frecknall’s revelatory production for the Almeida Theater of “Three Sisters,” which runs through June 1. (The feisty new adaptation is by Cordelia Lynn.) An unusually youthful cast reminds us that the blighted sisters are all less than 30 when Chekhov’s play begins, even if they are aged before their time by disappointment and regret. Not one for naturalism, Ms. Frecknall fills her stage with chairs, alongside a piano reminiscent of the crescent-shaped array of pianos in an earlier Almeida revival she directed, “Summer and Smoke.” At moments of ostracism or neglect, the characters can withdraw to a platform at the back of Hildegard Bechtler’s set, and, as the chairs disappear, a sense of depletion engulfs the show. Ms. Frecknall’s ensemble includes the fast-rising Patsy Ferran, who last month won an Olivier Award for her performance in “Summer and Smoke.” Playing the fretful eldest sister Olga, a schoolteacher resigned to her own spinsterhood, Ms. Ferran slips into the bustling cast just when she might instead be choosing star vehicles to advance her career. Pearl Chanda’s unsentimental Masha, the middle sister all but undone by love, and the wonderful Peter McDonald’s bearded Vershinin, the unhappily married military commander who speaks of a brighter future even as the sisters know better, are especially fine as the two halves of a doomed love affair. The future doesn’t loom much jollier for the sweet-natured Charity Hope Valentine (Anne-Marie Duff), the lovesick dance hall hostess at the bruised heart of “Sweet Charity.” The ever-popular 1966 musical, with its Neil Simon book, punchy Cy Coleman score and whip-smart lyrics by Dorothy Fields, is receiving a surpassingly smart revival at the Donmar Warehouse (through June 8). This production is the swan song of the theater’s artistic director, Josie Rourke; her successor, Michael Longhurst, starts his tenure next month. Those wanting soaring vocals and galvanic dance breaks won’t get those from Ms. Duff, who has built her career away from the musical theater. But her proven ability to burrow deep inside a character pays off: I’ve never seen such a searchingly acted portrayal of Charity as Ms. Duff provides here, and what she lacks in a Broadway-style belt is made up for by the emotional truth she brings to every moment in song. For once, you really feel this character’s ongoing drive toward a happiness that is always being deferred. Ms. Duff’s Charity says she loves happy endings, but has difficulty arriving at one of her own. Her co-star Arthur Darvill wrings unusual pathos, too, out of the part of Oscar, the prospective husband who cannot come to grips with the fact that Charity may not be entirely “pure,” to use the lingo of the show. The production ends with Charity back at her place of dubious employment, joining her colleagues in a sorrowful reprise of a song calling for “something better than this.” Will these women find it? As Chekhov’s Prozorov sisters would be the first to tell you, perhaps not in this lifetime. An earlier version of this article misstated the date that “All My Sons” runs until. It is June 8, not June 1.",The New York Times
2019,"Women Sue F.B.I., Claiming Discrimination at Training Academy","WASHINGTON — Women who were once F.B.I. recruits sued the bureau on Wednesday, accusing it of running a “good-old-boy network” at its training academy that discriminates against women, in some cases because of race and disabilities in addition to gender, and sets them up to fail. Male instructors at the academy in Quantico, Va., exposed the women beginning in 2015 to a hostile work environment, sexual harassment and inappropriate jokes, according to the lawsuit. One woman said that an instructor referred to an African-American female trainee as “spaghetti head,” a reference to her braids. The woman also said training agents made repeated sexual advances. In particular, the lawsuit takes aim at the tactical training that plays out Hogan’s Alley, the academy’s mock town where hired actors play terrorists and criminals. Trainees practice making dangerous arrests where they use weapons. Many of the female agent recruits were kicked out of the academy during this phase more quickly and more often than men were. [Women said F.B.I. training instructors punished them, not men, for mistakes.] “The real purpose of the suit is to change the culture of the F.B.I.,” said David J. Shaffer, the lawyer for the women. The suit also named the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, who is accused by one woman of dismissing her complaints, and Mark Morgan, President Trump’s nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who oversaw the academy as a former top F.B.I. official and was involved in the dismissal of female trainees. Mr. Comey declined to comment. Mr. Morgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sixteen women sued, seven of whom continue to work for the F.B.I. Some women did not use their full names, fearing retaliation. As part of the lawsuit, they asked for a review of the training evaluation process; $300,000 each for emotional stress; and more female training instructors. The F.B.I. declined to comment on the lawsuit but said in a statement that it was “committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected.” Internal figures provided by the F.B.I. show the bureau’s efforts to recruit more women are gaining traction. The F.B.I. said the number of women applying to be agents had increased from 22 percent in 2017 to 36 percent this year, surpassing the bureau’s goal of 33 percent for the current fiscal year. Attorney General William P. Barr said last month that he had directed the Justice Department to investigate accusations of discrimination, including claims that the F.B.I. academy forced out male potential agents for not being “masculine enough.” The lawsuit comes as the F.B.I., historically a male-dominated law enforcement agency, is trying to increase its ranks of female agents. Women made up only a fifth of the bureau’s 13,500 agents as of October, and few women work in the agency’s top echelons. In the lawsuit, a majority of the women took issue with many aspects of the F.B.I.’s agent training program. It typically lasts 20 weeks and involves firearms, academics, defensive tactics and navigating high-risk situations. According to the lawsuit, instructors overseeing the tactical training, most of whom are men, penalized and dismissed female trainees at a “rate significantly and disproportionately higher than their male counterparts.” The men, the lawsuit said, are allowed to retake tactical exams while women are denied the same opportunity. When the women tried to defend their decision-making or their actions, instructors admonished them for lacking integrity or emotional maturity, they said in the lawsuit. They also accused instructors of employing a double standard for men. “When male trainees do the same, they are praised for having a ‘command presence,’” the lawsuit said. One of the women, Clare Coetzer, washed out of training in June 2018 after passing all the previous required courses. During training, she was written up four times and given a warning that the F.B.I. calls a “suitability notice,” which put her in jeopardy of being kicked out of the program. But, Ms. Coetzer said, a male instructor rescinded two such notices that male colleagues received. She said she performed well on future tests but was still bounced from training. Another woman, Erika Wesley, worked for the F.B.I. for six years, completing an assignment in Baghdad before leaving the agency in 2010 before her first child was born. She attended training in 2018 to become an analyst. Ms. Wesley said she was subjected to “inappropriate sexually charged commentary” by male instructors, with some saying that women needed to take birth control to control their moods. When Lauren Rose, who works in the F.B.I.’s Miami field office, complained in an email in 2015 to Mr. Comey, the director at the time, about discriminatory practices, he rebuffed her. Mr. Comey suggested she use her “pain” to reflect on strengths and weaknesses, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit says Mr. Morgan was involved in Ms. Rose’s dismissal from the academy in 2015 and that he took issue with her “attitude” at the time. Ms. Rose said in the lawsuit that she had an “exemplary history of performance reviews” before her training and after as an F.B.I. employee. Female trainees were sometimes offered other F.B.I. positions after being kicked out of training but were “forced to take positions several grades lower than their previous grade or experience justified,” according to the lawsuit. Some of the same women filed a complaint last year with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accusing the F.B.I. of engaging in similar practices. Mr. Shaffer said his clients decided to sue after the F.B.I. ignored the complaint. “I asked the F.B.I. twice to sit down before this lawsuit, and the F.B.I. would not respond to me,” Mr. Shaffer said. “It’s very unusual.” In two previous class-action lawsuits, Mr. Shaffer said, the F.B.I. had been responsive. The women are receiving support from the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which fights workplace sexual harassment and discrimination.",The New York Times
2019,"Women in India, Tell Us How You Voted in This Election and Why","Help us understand the concerns that drove a wave of women to the polls in the world’s biggest election. A record number of women were expected to vote in India’s general election, and for the first time, they may account for half or more of the total votes cast — all at a moment when the country faces a slowing economy, societal divisions and environmental challenges, among other issues. The Times asked voters from different states and backgrounds to talk about the issues they were most concerned about as they cast their ballots. We invite other women in India to use the comments to tell us about the issues you are most concerned about in this election. We may feature some of them below. Rehana Khan, 24, housewife | Uttar Pradesh Ms. Khan comes from a conservative Muslim family in the city of Lucknow. She says the problems she faces start with daily, practical ones: drinking water that is unclean, piles of trash outside her house, rising inflation. But what troubles her the most right now are the big divisions in Indian society: between men and women, and between Hindus and Muslims. “The elderly in my family object to girls’ education. The general impression is that if you get your daughter a good education, she will think differently, she will want to step out and get a job,” she said. “It’s a bad time to be a woman in India.” The Hindu-first rhetoric of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has also troubled many Indian Muslims. “I voted for the party that I thought would not divide the society on the lines of religion,” she said. “I was getting exasperated hearing ‘Hindu-Muslim, Hindu-Muslim.’” Imoni Sangmaji, 30, factory worker | Assam Ms. Sangmaji works in a silk factory, producing fabric in Assam’s state capital, Guwahati. She says the B.J.P. has helped improve roads and electricity in her area, and credits Mr. Modi for a campaign that installed tens of millions of toilets around the country. She feels life, overall, is better now than it used to be. “Some years ago, I could not imagine leaving home after dark, but that’s improving,” she said. “So is the toilet situation. I used to go out to the fields until about three years ago. That has changed, and we have a toilet in the village now.’’ But she feels that schooling, especially for girls, remains a real problem. “Illiteracy contributes to a backward society. There are schools but no teachers,” she said. Her dream is to send her 11-year-old daughter to a good school, so she can “grow up and take up a job of her liking.’’ Gayatri Nair, 36, wedding photographer | Tamil Nadu Ms. Nair lives in the southern Indian city of Chennai with her husband and three dogs. She is deeply concerned about environmental issues and says that Chennai suffers from diminishing green cover, dirty air, too few parks and too much garbage. “Pollution is at the top of my mind,” she said. “We live in a country where millions are dying every year from pollution-related health issues, and yet I don’t hear even one political party talking about this seriously. While I do see the environment on the manifestoes of B.J.P. and the Congress, I’m very skeptical of how much they will actually do.” As a wedding photographer, she has observed many families. “It disheartens me to still see so many age-old sexist practices continued and celebrated,” she said. “At the same time, I do see some couples making the effort to shift this culture. Every time I shoot an inter-caste, inter-religion wedding, with the support of their families, I see hope for this country’s future!” Maninder Kaur, 42, farmer | Punjab Like many Indians who farm for a living, Ms. Kaur is angry at the government, saying that officials have not lived up to their vows to improve life in rural areas. “Politicians don’t care about common people like us, not at all. They always give us false hopes and fake promises,” she said. “I work six hours a day in the fields, and there is no value attached to my work.” She feels it is time to change certain traditions that favor men, particularly those that would make it difficult to pass down her share of the family farm to her daughter. “I want to get into village-level politics, but it’s really difficult because I’m uneducated,” she said. “But I will not give up.” Her area will be among the last to vote in India’s rolling, six-week-long parliamentary elections. She said she was still torn about whether to vote for the Akali Dal party, as she usually has, or to register a protest vote. “I am very disillusioned this time and may press NOTA” — None of the Above. Rohita Dwivedi, 43, marketing professor | Maharashtra Ms. Dwivedi teaches marketing and retail subjects at Prin. L. N. Welingkar Institute of Management Development and Research in Mumbai, one of India’s largest cities. She said she was supporting the B.J.P. because of improvements during the party’s last five years of governance, including in the economy, in fighting corruption, and in providing better access to banking and sanitation for everyday Indians. “Benefits of the government’s schemes actually were passed on to the poor — be it toilet building, housing for the poor, electrification, health insurance, cooking gas and many more,” she said. “We, as countrymen, saw a five-year term without scams, and that is a big achievement.” She is worried about a widespread “lack of pride and confidence” in India right now. But she believes the B.J.P. is in the best position to improve that, too. “India is a complex nation and certainly no party is perfect, but there is this party that gives me hope,” she said. “As an Indian, I am finally proud.” Mala, 35, maid | Bihar Mala, who goes by first name only, sweeps floors and performs other domestic duties for a wealthy family in New Delhi. She works 10 hours a day, six days a week, making $160 a month. Born into a lower caste, she says she feels humiliated by the way she is treated. “Am I made differently from them?” she asked. Above all, she says she wants better education opportunities for her children so that they do not have to take jobs as servants. And she credits Mr. Modi for improving that prospect for poor and low-caste Indians, saying he “has done well in that way for us.” She remains worried about her daughters’ safety given the prevalence of sexual assault. “This country is not safe for girls. When they leave the house, I am on the edge, and when I’m at work, I constantly worry,” she said. “We hear of rape and harassment everywhere.” Kalpana Tatavarti, 52, business executive | Karnataka Ms. Tatavarti runs a company, Parity Consulting, that emphasizes gender parity in the workplace. Her goal is to get more women into executive positions, but she says the government needs to improve basic facilities to help that: day-care centers for working moms or even just more bathrooms for women. She is concerned about sexual assault and feels the government has failed to protect women. “Please don’t say women should protect themselves,” she said. “Protecting themselves by doing what? Wearing a burqa? Staying at home? Because that’s what happens, finally.” She is also troubled by what she describes as an oppressive political climate that “snuffs out dissent.” “No sooner than you say something that’s different from the majority, and abuse or heckling is unleashed at you,” she said. “In our neighborhood associations, in our WhatsApp groups, in our friends’ circles, it is so pervasive. People are afraid to state their opinions. Is this what we call democracy?” We invite other women in India to use the comments to tell us about the issues you are most concerned about in this election.

2019,"Women, Alcohol and Perceived ‘Sexual Availability’","In her words A new study finds that women who drink alcohol in social settings are seen as more “sexually available” and “less human.” You’re reading In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “Just holding a beer bottle increased perceptions of intoxication and sexual availability for women.” — Jeanine Skorinko, a psychology researcher and author of a recent study about women and alcohol When Brock Turner, the former Stanford swimmer who was found guilty in 2016 of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on campus, appealed his conviction, he and his lawyers devoted 60 pages to how intoxicated the victim seemed. He lost the appeal. Last year, a Yale student, Saifullah Khan, was found not guilty of sexually assaulting a fellow student. His lawyers worked relentlessly to discredit the account of the woman, repeatedly asking how much she’d had to drink. Using alcohol to cast doubt on women’s reputations, particularly in cases of sexual assault, in court and in life is not rare. Now a new study from researchers at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the University of Nebraska and Iowa State University finds that women who drink are in fact judged more harshly than men who do the same. The study, titled “She Looks Like She’d Be an Animal in Bed: Dehumanization of Drinking Women in Social Contexts,” explored the stereotypes applied to women who drink and how presumptions of alcohol and sexual promiscuity go hand-in-hand. It was published in a May issue of the journal Sex Roles. Researchers found that both women and men believed that a woman drinking alcohol in a social setting was more intoxicated than a man having the same drink, and that she was more “sexually available” and “less human” than a woman drinking water or a man drinking alcohol. “Sexual availability” was defined as whether study participants perceived the women to be single or open to having casual sex. “Less human” meant they were perceived to lack self-restraint and were described as mechanical and cold, unsophisticated, superficial, shallow, less intelligent and rational, as well as more immoral. (The researchers came to these conclusions by asking study participants to respond to photos and fake social media posts of a woman and a man drinking.) The findings, not surprisingly, have “troubling implications,” said Jeanine Skorinko, a psychology professor at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and an author of the study. Among them, the researchers found that people may be less likely to help a woman in a risky situation if she’s been drinking because they might think she’s interested in risky or casual sexual behaviors, and therefore not think the situation is a threat to her. “This is especially shocking,” Skorinko said, “because just holding a beer bottle increased perceptions of intoxication and sexual availability for women, but not for men.” Sign up here to get future installments of In Her Words delivered to your inbox. ______ Here are five articles from The Times you might have missed. “It’s awesome how many girls are showing up and throwing down.” Teenage girls are claiming their place inside an emerging online community of extreme athletes who flip, freerun and defy expectations.

By the mid-1970s, Day had been dismissed as a goody-two-shoes and the leader of Hollywood’s chastity brigade, but the passing decades have brought a reappraisal, especially by some feminists, of her achievements.

2019,Wondering at the ‘Special Universe’ of Gay Life in All Its Diversity,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. OUT OF THE SHADOWS Reimagining Gay Men’s Lives By Walt Odets When the clinical psychologist Walt Odets began working with gay men in San Francisco in the mid-1980s, much of the therapy focused on trauma and shame. There was the reality of growing up gay in America combined with the catastrophe of the AIDS epidemic, which by 1989 had killed at least 90,000 people, including a number of Odets’s patients. More than three decades later, the gay men Odets now works with live in a markedly different world, one where they can marry and in which sex doesn’t come booby-trapped with the fear of death. A gay man, Pete Buttigieg, is widely considered a viable presidential candidate, his sexual orientation seemingly no longer disqualifying (and possibly even an asset). Many in the contemporary L.G.B.T. movement insist that gay men — particularly white gay men — have relatively little to worry about in 2019. But in “Out of the Shadows,” Odets argues that the transformational effects of recent political and judicial victories on the lives of gay men have been greatly exaggerated. “Shame still often lurks unconsciously behind the most successful of gay lives,” he writes, a theme that he returns to over and over again in a book that is part polemic, part memoir and part road map for gay people hoping to live fully. Odets is clear that the shame he believes still haunts many gay men isn’t their fault. “The stigmatization of gay people has always been a societal problem for which gay people have been blamed,” he writes. To add to that, there is the lingering traumatic effects of a “deeply stigmatizing 15-year plague” and what Odets calls our current “late epidemic,” which, despite game-changing breakthroughs in treatment and prevention, still results in some 40,000 new H.I.V. infections a year. Odets also dissects the psychological impact of families and communities that too often burden young gay men with shame. He rejects the idea that we live in a post-homophobic country. “There is not a single gay man alive in America who has not sometimes felt self-conscious or fearful about touching a lover in public,” he writes, correctly calling this “a human tragedy.” The solution to the enduring psychological challenges facing gay men, Odets believes, likely won’t be found in a desperate attempt to make a home in institutions designed by heterosexual people, including marriage. Odets writes that if “acceptance is predicated on ‘normalizing’ gay relationships by molding them — at least in appearance — into conventional heterosexual forms, the change will become a significant additional source of hopelessness for gay men. Mimicking and misrepresentation are inauthentic, and inauthentic lives feel hopeless.” Nor will healing always be found, Odets argues, in contemporary gay communities, where he laments that younger and older men too often view each other with increasing suspicion and hostility, and where he insists that — despite the ostensibly endless possibilities for connection offered by gay dating and hookup apps — “isolation is endemic.” Odets’s solution is for gay men to acknowledge and face the shame they’ve been burdened with, and then to begin the difficult work of building lives “that stand on authentic self-acceptance.” Odets introduces us to a number of men struggling to do just that and sometimes succeeding. Some of these case studies (and the conclusions Odets draws from them) feel dated and not particularly profound, and Odets is at his best when focusing less on his patients and more on the gay men with whom he has shared his own life. “Out of the Shadows” finds its purpose in its strong last two chapters, including an extraordinary one focused on Odets’s small chosen family of friends and lovers. Here, his writing is poignant and achingly beautiful — so much so, in fact, that I occasionally had to put the book down to avoid weeping on the subway. There’s sadness in Odets’s life story, but there’s mostly resilience, tenderness and a willingness to fashion an unapologetic gay life, sometimes against all odds. (The exquisitely told story of Odets’s longtime friend and lover, who fled a trailer he shared with a brutally homophobic family and built a life bursting with meaning and intimacy, is the most compelling story of gay self-actualization I’ve ever encountered.) Odets and his close friends and lovers should serve as an inspiration to many gay men, as well as a reminder of what might be the book’s most enduring message. “All the diverse forms that true gay life has improvised,” Odets writes, “constitute a special universe that should not be relinquished to meet the expectations of a pathological society.”",The New York Times
2019,Woody Allen Pitched a Memoir. Publishers Weren’t Interested.,"Woody Allen has been largely shunned by Hollywood. Celebrities who once vied for roles in his films now say they regret working with him. Amazon has backed out of a multimovie distribution deal with him. Now, Allen appears to be losing stature in another quarter of the entertainment industry: publishing. In the last year, Allen quietly tried to sell a memoir, according to executives at four major publishing houses, only to be met with indifference or hard passes. Before the #MeToo movement roared to life, Allen’s memoir would probably have set off a bidding war and commanded six or seven figures, given his cultural status. But with his career all but derailed by resurfaced allegations that he molested his daughter Dylan Farrow nearly three decades ago — allegations that Allen denies and that have left Americans unsure whom to believe — the prospect of publishing his memoir seems to hold little appeal. Executives at multiple publishing houses said that an agent representing Allen approached their companies about the memoir late last year, but that they made no offers, largely because of the negative publicity that working with Allen may have generated. Some publishers declined to even read the material, which apparently consisted of a full manuscript. The executives said they knew of no other publishers who offered Allen a book deal; if one has, it has been kept tightly under wraps, and the manuscript does not seem to have been widely pitched. Some publishing executives used the word “toxic” when describing the challenges of working with Allen in the current environment, noting that while he remains a significant cultural figure, the commercial risks of releasing a memoir by him were too daunting. [A timeline of the complicated history of Woody Allen and the Farrows.] Each of the executives declined to speak on the record, citing an understanding of confidentiality between agents and publishers regarding nascent or unsigned projects. The writer Daphne Merkin, who has known Allen for a long time, said he had referred to his memoir as a project that he had been working on for a while, and she noted that she had mentioned the book to some editors she knows. Merkin said she hadn’t read the manuscript and wasn’t sure what aspects of his life the book covers or whether he addresses the accusations and the subsequent fallout. “He’s not one to set the record straight, but presumably, the memoir is his side of things,” she said. “He’s the kind of person who soldiers on, and someone whose work is his nutrient. Whatever vicissitudes he’s been exposed to, I think he keeps his own counsel about how all this affects and doesn’t affect him.” Queries to Allen’s production company and publicist went unanswered; his producer and sister, Letty Aronson, and the filmmaker Robert Weide, who has defended Allen, said they were unaware that Allen had written a memoir. Allen’s longtime agent, John Burnham of ICM Partners, declined to comment beyond saying, “For the 30 years that I’ve worked with Woody, the standard mantra on anything is, ‘I can’t discuss his business,’” Burnham said. The tepid response from some publishers marks another blow to Allen’s career and legacy. Allen is currently locked in a court battle with Amazon. The streaming giant scotched their four-movie deal, which included the now-shelved film “A Rainy Day in New York,” and in response, Allen sued the company for at least $68 million. In a court filing, Amazon cited tone-deaf remarks Allen made about the #MeToo movement, along with public statements from several actors who said they regretted working with him as evidence that it would be impossible to profit from Allen’s work. The break with Amazon and the lack of interest in his memoir from several major publishers highlight how tenuous his once hallowed position has become. “Personally, I don’t foresee any work in his future,” said Tim Gray, senior vice president and the awards editor at Variety, the entertainment industry trade publication. “However, it’s possible that history will be kinder to Woody Allen than the current moment seems to be.” He added that “Hollywood loves comeback stories; Ingrid Bergman, Charlie Chaplin and Elizabeth Taylor were each denounced on the floor of Congress for their private lives, but were eventually welcomed with open arms by Hollywood and the public.” Allen is known for work inflected with literary and philosophical references, and he has a long track record in publishing. He began his career as a comedy writer. As a teenager, he got a job writing jokes for an advertising agency in New York, and, in the 1960s, he began publishing satirical pieces in The New Yorker. He contributed 44 pieces to the magazine over the decades, and last wrote for them in 2013. His first book, the humor anthology “Getting Even,” was released in 1971 by Random House, and the publisher put out several more of his books, including “Without Feathers” and “Side Effects.” Even when much of the material was recycled, his books often found an eager, if not enormous, audience. (His 2007 humor collection, “Mere Anarchy,” sold more than 40,000 copies in print, according to NPD BookScan.) Critics were not always kind. Reviewing “Mere Anarchy,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times that “he has sustained a writing style that remains impervious to the changing world around him” and added that “the best of Allen’s old pieces outshine the new work.” A reviewer for The Guardian groused that “even in the smallest doses, these lazy riffs and lame parodies do more to annoy than entertain.” Although several biographers have tackled Allen as a subject, he has never published a straightforward memoir. In 2003, Allen was close to a deal to sell a memoir to Penguin for about $3 million, but Allen held out for more money. “For this I want a lot of money. The ball is in your court,” Mr. Allen wrote in a letter to his agent that was sent around as a proposal. But these days, publishers are skittish about working with authors accused of sexual misconduct — for pragmatic reasons as much as ethical ones. Authors facing harassment allegations have been dropped by their agents, their finished books pulped, literary awards revoked and their books pulled from store shelves. Boycotts by readers and booksellers often snowball to envelop publishers as well. Dylan Farrow, the adopted daughter of Allen and his former girlfriend, Mia Farrow, accused Allen of inappropriately touching her in 1992, when she was 7. Investigators found no evidence of sexual abuse. But Dylan Farrow has stood firm by her allegations, and her family remains divided, with her mother and her brother Ronan Farrow supporting her, and her brother Moses Farrow defending his father. She reiterated them in opinion pieces in 2014 and 2017 and in a televised interview in 2018 that unleashed fresh waves of outrage against Allen. Theater adaptations of Allen’s film “Bullets Over Broadway” were canceled, and actors, including Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page, Evan Rachel Wood, Michael Caine and Colin Firth, expressed remorse at having worked with him. Several stars of the now-shelved “A Rainy Day in New York,” including Timothée Chalamet, said they would donate their proceeds from the film to charity. Allen is still celebrated in some corners. The actress Anjelica Huston, who has appeared in two of his films, told Vulture she would work with him again “in a second.” Similarly, the Spanish actor Javier Bardem lamented the “public lynching” of the filmmaker and said he would work with him “tomorrow morning” if asked. The Spanish production company MediaPro continues to collaborate with Allen on his newest film. A MediaPro spokeswoman said that the untitled project is scheduled to start shooting in July in northern Basque Country, and that the cast was being assembled. She had no further details. Allen, an accomplished clarinetist, also still has music fans. In June, he has an eight-city tour planned for Europe with the Eddy Davis New Orleans Jazz Band, after their weekly residency this spring in New York at the Carlyle Hotel. Those performances, which cost $165 per person, with a $75 prix fixe menu, were nearly sold out.",The New York Times

Finally, Ms. Daly carefully cut away the paper pattern and any unwanted organdy, revealing the design on the net. Knowing her lace, Rebecca also had requested some guipure openwork.

Eavesdropping on some characters speaking Polish, she’s amazed to find she understands every word: “I, with my command only of Romance languages (I dabble in German, know the names of 20 kinds of fish in Japanese, have soaked up a splash of Bosnian, and understand barely a word of the language of the country in which this room is to be found), I, as I’ve said, somehow did manage to understand most of what they were saying.” If I had more space, I’d happily expatiate on what’s wrong with this mortifying passage. But two things leap out right away: the gratuitous humblebrag about the speaker’s fancy expertises (sashimi!), and the labored, self-conscious explanation of her narrative context. The author of this tortured self-advertisement wasn’t a born novelist. _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

Scott: …The reawakening of the slumbering franchise in 2015 gave birth to “Jurassic World,” one of the highest-grossing terrible movies of all time, a lumbering walk in the rebooted park that squandered the charisma of the big lizards and the charm of the human cast in a witless farrago of blockbuster self-importance. “Fallen Kingdom,” directed by J. A. Bayona, is in most respects a dumber, less ambitious movie than its immediate predecessor, and also, for just that reason, a little bit more fun.

2019,Work Out and Chill?,"Cool temperature workouts may be the answer for those who want to exercise without becoming a hot mess. I’m a regular six-day-a-week exerciser and a fan of strenuous cardio workouts along the lines of hill sprints, running, high-intensity interval training and jump rope. But I find it difficult to exercise when the temperature rises above 65 degrees Fahrenheit. I get too sweaty, overheated and sluggish. Even the air-conditioned gym in my apartment building isn’t cool enough. I need to be surrounded by two floor fans to move hard the way I like to and crave chilly fall and winter days when I can exercise outside in 40-degree or cooler weather. Summer, needless to say, is my least favorite time to get my cardio fix in. Over the years, plenty of people, including my husband, have told me that I’m eccentric. But there is some evidence that cool temperatures support an increase in exercise performance and fat burn. Late last summer I started going to Brrrn, a Manhattan exercise studio where all the classes are held in a room kept at 50 degrees Fahrenheit, based on the idea that cool temperature exposure improves endurance and burns more calories than an ambient or heated environment. The studio’s founders and owners, Johnny Adamic, who worked on Mayor Bloomberg’s obesity task force, and Jimmy Martin, a certified personal trainer and former college wrestler, said that the idea to open their cool temperature studio in 2013 came from Mr. Martin’s experience training a client. “We were in a gym where it was pretty hot, and she got faint and had to stop,” Mr. Martin said. “She told me that she was from Boston and loved exercising in cold weather because she found it easier.” As a former wrestler used to competing in matches in non-air-conditioned settings, Mr. Martin had long thought that profuse sweat equaled a more challenging workout. “I was intrigued by her reaction to the heat and by what she said but started researching cold temperature workouts and found lots of evidence to support how she felt,” he said. Dr. Ira Jacobs, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Toronto, for one, has researched the phenomenon of cold weather workouts and found that people can exercise for longer and harder, and thereby burn more calories, if they can slow down the rate at which their body temperature increases. “When you work out, you produce heat, but your rate of perceived exertion is less when it’s colder, making exercise seem easier,” he said. Indeed, research published in the journal Diabetes in 2014 shows that exposure to cold stimulates growth of brown fat, which burns calories. But the exposure has to be repeated. “You have to feel cold for a number of weeks before there is brown fat production and an increase in calorie burn,” Dr. Jacobs said. And a 2013 report in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, led by professors at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, states that “regular exposure to mild cold may provide a healthy and sustainable alternative strategy for increasing energy expenditure.” Ray Cronise, a former NASA scientist, has studied mild cold stress and health span and said that humans not only burn more calories while they’re exposed to cold temperatures, they continue to do so for hours afterward. Harley Pasternak, a Los Angeles-based personal trainer who studied the impact of the environment on exercise when he worked as an exercise physiologist for the Canadian military, said that humans burn more calories in colder climates because the body has to work harder to create heat. “In a warm environment, your metabolism gets slower so that your core temperature doesn’t overheat,” he said. Mr. Pasternak’s sprawling training facility in Los Angeles has a room with a treadmill where the thermostat is set to below 59 degrees. “When my trainers or I have clients on calorie-burning programs, we often have them go in there for cardio sessions because it’s not as much of a strain for them to really push themselves,” he said. In his role as the global fitness adviser for Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Mr. Pasternak said that he is looking to incorporate elements of temperature manipulation in the brand’s gyms, which would mean having heated rooms ideal for yoga and stretching and cold rooms for fat burning. Of course, some people like stretching and sweating in hot yoga studios, and may have trouble warming up to the idea of chilling. Most gyms have their thermostats set to between 68 and 72 degrees. But Christopher Minson, head of the department of human physiology at the University of Oregon who has done numerous studies on exercising in high heat and heat acclimation workouts, said that this temperature range is too warm for endurance workouts such as intense cardio sessions. “It’s true that endurance performance diminishes in temperatures higher than 50 degrees,” he said. “You might feel chilly when you start, but you will warm up fast,” he said. “If it helps you work harder, you will burn more calories.” Stephen Kaminsky, a Chelsea resident who works in the finance industry, takes two to three classes a week at Brrrn and said that he can noticeably push himself harder, compared with when he is exercising in a warmer setting. “Instead of lifting 25 pounds overhead, I do 40 pounds,” he said. Lindsay Koffler, a graphic designer who lives in the East Village, is a regular, too, and said that, thanks to the cold room, she no longer dreads doing burpees. “I used to despise them but now, I can get through 20 of them- twice as many as normal- and still feel energized after,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,Work in America Is Greedy. But It Doesn’t Have to Be.,"Long, inflexible hours are the norm. But in a tight job market, more companies are offering flexibility on the when and where of work. The best employees show unending loyalty to work, staying long hours and being on call for bosses or clients. At least, that’s the credo of 21st-century American capitalism. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Even though long, unpredictable hours have become a feature of many jobs, and people who work them now earn disproportionately more, some employers have figured out how to cede more control over where or when work gets done. It’s happening even in occupations where face time and on-call availability seem essential, like finance or food service. There are signs that, with unemployment at the lowest point in half a century, more companies are turning to flexible work arrangements to recruit workers — and, in some cases, creating a model for how work in the United States could be remade. At Credigy, a finance company near Atlanta, any worker can arrive late, leave early or work from home, no questions asked, as long as the work gets done — and even the members of the senior leadership team do so. It’s a different world from most professional services companies, which require long hours in the office. At Miss B’s Cafe in Louisburg, Kan., servers collaborate on their schedules so they can fill in for anyone who needs a day off, and the kitchen manager bakes brunch pastries the evening before so she can attend yoga on weekend mornings. It’s unlike many service-sector jobs, in which schedules can be assigned at the last minute. The long and unpredictable hours that have resulted from America’s obsession with work have spread from the so-called greedy professions, like law, finance and consulting, to many other jobs, both salaried and hourly. It’s a major driver of gender inequality: The increasing wage premiums of long hours have pushed many couples with equal educations to take on unequal roles, because if they’re parents, they can’t be on call at work unless someone else is on call at home. Working like this also contributes to burnout, stress and poor health — without necessarily helping productivity. It’s one of the reasons that Americans have among the lowest levels of happiness and work-life balance in the developed world. Control over the time and location of work is the key to closing gender gaps, according to research by Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard. The changes can be small, like allowing employees to step away during the day, work remotely or shift their schedules, said Annie Dean, a co-founder of Werk, which provides companies with flexibility data and tools. Driven by competition for workers, more employers have begun offering these benefits (while still providing stable wages and benefits, unlike in the gig economy). Sixty-eight percent allow workers to telecommute as needed, up from 54 percent in 2014, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. Twenty-seven percent offer the flexibility to work outside normal business hours, up from 22 percent. “For the last 10 years, employers have been used to having it all their own way,” said Martha Gimbel, an economist at Indeed, the job search site. “In a tight labor market, they’re having to compete in a way they’re not used to.” Stanford University has discovered that offering shorter hours is a way to tap an available and highly educated group of workers. More than 600 of its staff members have reduced schedules. “The labor market is incredibly tight in Silicon Valley, and suddenly you’re able to access a whole labor pool of people,” said Nicholas Bloom, an economist there. “They’re highly qualified people, and they’re very loyal, because there are not 50 other jobs like that.” Even when people work long hours, it’s unlikely they’re actually working the whole time. At Unlimited Power, which makes portable solar grids in Greenville, S.C., everyone has a 26-hour workweek but is paid for a 40-hour one (based on average pay for similar jobs in the area). Chris Petrella, the chief executive, said people were just as productive because they worked more efficiently. In contrast to his old job in management consulting, they rarely use email (they text instead), and they “stop having meetings, and meetings about meetings.” “Once you implement it, you’re like, ‘O.K., a lot of the stuff we do at work really isn’t productive, and it really isn’t work,’” he said. “It’s not: Go in on Monday and work eight hours a day until the weekend. It’s: This is the project I need to get done, and I only need to be here a few hours a day, so I might as well use those productively.” Technology has helped employers be able to call on employees at all hours, but it has also helped employees be able to work at different times and places. At Auth0, which makes security technology for businesses, nearly all the employees work remotely — 475 people across 32 countries. (Jobs like receptionist are the exception.) The chief executive leaves at 4 p.m. to pick up his children. The key, said Melinda Starbird, its vice president for human resources, is technology for messaging and video conferencing. One result has been far fewer internal emails or meetings, said Ms. Starbird, who goes to the Seattle office a couple of days a week and works from home the rest of the time. Senior managers and high earners are more likely to be on call outside business hours, but they’re also more likely than a junior or hourly employee to be able to step out midday. That’s true at Wente Vineyards, a winery in Livermore, Calif. Grape pickers, wine bottlers and tasting room servers cannot easily take extended breaks. But during their employment anniversary month, they receive eight hours off to use as they please — taking a few hours off on a few different days — and the company has considered expanding those breaks to other times of the year. It has begun training people to do more jobs so they can easily fill in for other employees, said Amy Hoopes, the president. Many white-collar jobs also prioritize time in the office. At BDO, the accounting firm, it’s especially true during tax season, when people work long hours with intense deadlines. So the company started busy-season breaks — short periods when employees can leave work and not check their phones. They’ve taken children to the zoo or gone for a hike. “We felt very strongly that it’s during the busiest time of year when day-to-day flex is most important,” said Marcee Harris Schwartz, the national director for diversity and inclusion. “When you’re working all the time is when you make mistakes or burn out or decide you’re leaving accounting forever.” BDO also has “go dark weekends,” when people don’t log in to their work accounts for a weekend and assign a colleague to handle emergencies. Most professional services jobs require individual workers to be responsive to clients around the clock, but Ms. Schwartz said BDO had learned that there were multiple advantages when clients relied on a team instead. A big part of making flexibility work is convincing people they can use it. That didn’t happen at Credigy, the finance firm, until it put in a formal set of benefits, with the help of Werk, and senior executives started using them, said Kim Williams, the senior director of employee experience. “What we’ve encouraged is that you don’t need to justify the ask,” she said. “It’s not taboo anymore.” The biggest use of the benefit has been for caregiving, but people have also used it for volunteering, exercising or taking classes. “Working mothers maybe had a louder voice for a long time, out of necessity, but we fully believed it’s an important issue not just for women and caregivers, but for everybody,” Ms. Williams said. Half of workers say they would switch jobs if they found one that offered them the ability to adjust their schedule as needed, and 37 percent would switch if they could work remotely at least part of the time, Gallup found. One recent study found that workers were willing to accept 20 percent less pay to avoid jobs in which employers set their schedules with a week’s notice and had them work evenings and weekends. Another found that people thought that setting their own schedule was equivalent to a 9 percent wage increase, and that telecommuting was worth a 4 percent raise. It’s not clear yet whether benefits like these will outlast the competitive labor market. Real change for American workers would mean that entire industries question whether they need to work the way they do — fundamentally remaking how work gets done. “It’s easy,” Ms. Gimbel said, “to mistake progress in a tight labor market for long-term systemic change.” Businesses of very different sizes and specialties cited many of the same strategies for offering flexibility. Ditch email for internal communication. Use Slack or text messages instead. (They say these are more efficient, and also more intrusive, so people pause before interrupting someone off hours.) Have fewer meetings. Ask yourself whether something really requires an in-person conversation. Always include a dial-in number or video conferencing link in calendar invitations to include people who are working remotely. Train employees to do other jobs so they can fill in for one another. Assign teams to cover clients, and tap recent retirees as substitutes. Keep part-time employees on the advancement track for promotions. Make flexibility a formal, structured part of work, not something given on an individual basis. Ensure that everyone takes advantage of it — including senior managers, men and people who aren’t parents.",The New York Times
2019,Working Moms and Stay-at-Home Moms Are Not at War,"They’re often the same people — because parents go in and out of the work force depending on their caretaking needs. [Sign up here to receive NYT Parenting in your inbox once a week] This week NYT Parenting is debuting guides about negotiating for parental leave in a variety of work situations where leave may not be guaranteed: if you’re an hourly worker, if you’re a freelancer or if you’re employed by a company without a formal leave policy. What we don’t have is a guide on how to decide whether to go back to work at all after the birth of a child, because we realized that the way each family resolves that question is so personally and financially complicated that we couldn’t possibly provide a satisfying set of answers. But in researching how parents reconcile work and family, one thing jumped out at me: For too long, we have been talking about “stay-at-home parents” and “working parents” as if staying at home and working were fixed, unchanging states. Additionally, there’s the persistent cultural myth that working parents and stay-at-home parents are locked in a perpetual grudge match (colloquially referred to by that cringeworthy, retrograde term “the mommy wars”). But according to researchers, the mommy wars are, at most, a skirmish between extremists on either side. Research has shown that since the late ’70s, millions of moms have left the work force for some period of time and then returned. (We’re talking mostly about moms here since stay-at-home dads are in the minority — only 7 percent of them stayed home in 2016, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center analysis. For comparison, 27 percent of moms stayed home that same year — and that percentage has remained consistent since 1989). The need or desire to stay home can emerge at any time, in response to changing personal priorities, care obligations or financial circumstances. In a recent study published in the journal Demography, Dr. Alexandra Killewald, a sociology professor at Harvard University, analyzed employment patterns during the first 18 years of motherhood, among a group of about 3,500 women who were teens and young adults in 1979. She found that nearly half of this cohort consistently worked throughout those years, whether it was full- or part-time. Fifteen percent of these moms returned to the work force around when their children went to kindergarten, while another 14 percent returned to the work force around when their children went to junior high. Twenty-one percent of this group remained out of the work force for the entire 18 years. The group of women who did not work outside the home at all were more likely to lack high school diplomas and to have traditional attitudes about gender roles, Dr. Killewald told me. What’s also important to note is that the real-live humans making decisions about working or staying home aren’t ’80s-era parodies of shoulder-padded working moms sneering at cookie-baking stay-at-home moms and vice versa. Women’s actual attitudes about their professional and caregiving choices are far more complicated and less judgmental — and they have been for a while. It was always a minority of mothers who were “dismissive and contemptuous,” said Stephanie Coontz, a history professor at Evergreen State College who has studied marriage and families for decades and has done many studies, oral interviews and focus groups with real parents: “The rest of moms were vulnerable to feeling defensive and hardening their positions because they were deeply ambivalent.” Which is to say, working moms felt conflicted and guilty about working, and stay-at-home moms felt conflicted and guilty about staying at home. Research shows that children can thrive with both working moms and stay-at-home moms, and attitudes about mothers who work have evolved over time. As they always have, parents are making decisions about working or staying home for a wide variety of reasons: because they’re breadwinners and have no choice; because child care costs are out of control; because they really enjoy and find meaning in what they do; because raising kids feels more valuable than sitting in airless conference rooms; because they have spouses whose work is all-encompassing, and someone needs to keep the children alive. Though policy has mostly focused on the parents of newborns, Dr. Killewald said, family responsibilities don’t go away after parental leave. For many mothers, “statistically speaking it takes another decade before they recover to the same rate of full-time employment that they were at before the kid was born,” Dr. Killewald said. Someone still needs to take the kids to doctor’s appointments and soccer practice, and that someone is still disproportionately likely to be Mom (why it’s still Mom is a topic for another newsletter). More research is needed on the additional responsibilities shouldered by parents of kids with special needs, according to Dr. Killewald. “It is a real job to navigate the school system, the insurance you’re dealing with, extra help around the home,” when you have a child with special needs, she said.

2019,Worried About the Weather for Your Cruise? So Is James Van Fleet,"Q&A James Van Fleet is the only chief meteorologist working in the cruise industry. Surprisingly, hurricanes are not his biggest concern. James Van Fleet, chief meteorologist for Royal Caribbean Cruises, tracks the weather around the world for dozens of ships.CreditCreditRoyal Caribbean Most cruise lines have a large staff that includes a deck crew, housekeeping, entertainers and more. But only one has a chief meteorologist whose sole job is to track the daily weather for multiple ships and about 150,000 passengers. James Van Fleet joined Royal Caribbean International two years ago, after more than two decades as a meteorologist on television and radio. As the first full-time, on-staff chief meteorologist for both the company and the cruise industry, a position he calls a “dream job,” he travels around the world and works with cruise staff to keep travelers safe. He has helped dozens of captains navigate through storms and heavy rain, fog and other inclement weather. His job also involves forecasting the weather weeks ahead, to help the company’s shoreside and shipboard teams decide if they should cancel, reroute or reschedule cruises. Mr. Van Fleet spoke with The Times about growing up around tornadoes, his odd work hours and how the weather in the Bahamas could affect the 135-foot waterslide at Royal Caribbean’s newly reopened private island, Perfect Day at CocoCay. I grew up in Tulsa, Okla., where the weather can literally kill you. When we have tornado days, the state shuts down. Everyone pays attention. It’s in my DNA. I started in some radio stations, then I worked behind the scenes in television. I did some storm chasing and got on television, working for Fox, ABC and CBS affiliates. A recruiter reached out about this job. I’m up in the middle of the night tracking Australia and Asia. In the early morning, I’m tracking Europe, and during normal workday hours I’m looking at the Caribbean. It never stops. It’s the complete opposite of a nine-to-five job. I get to work with people on the other side of the globe. You have to have current weather data to make a forecast. You got to know what’s happening right now. For example, what’s happening in Europe now and what will be happening in Europe later? This is the most challenging forecasting I’ve ever done. It’s trickier than just ‘is it going to be windy or is it going to rain?’ The stakes are quite high, so I never step away from the data for too long. I need to know what’s been going on in different places at different times. Several times a day at hours that make no sense to anybody, I’m looking at data. I’m always asking myself: What did the weather data say a day or two days ago? There’s a big waterslide and because of its height, we have to be careful about tracking lightning. There’s also a big balloon ride that takes people up to 450 feet and we have to really think about the wind there. I’ve been on 24 of the 26 Royal Caribbean International ships. It takes every bit of the time to get to every one and build relationships. I keep an eye on the ships of our sister lines, but I’m more involved with these 26. I work with two dozen meteorologists who have gone to the academy and gotten basic meteorology skills. They are great. Part of my job is to help educate them on things they didn’t learn in the academy. This company walked the walk when it realized things were going in a direction that put guests in trouble. It made the changes to address that. The accidents are not something we’re proud of, and changes have been made to help us keep that from happening again. Less than a year after those accidents, I was hired. And obviously this is a dream job for me, but it also speaks to the company prioritizing safety. A cruise ship is a city at sea. There’s going to be a fender bender, a stubbed toe. But the sooner you can catch issues, the sooner you can make adjustments. My job is to help catch things early. You’d think so, but no. The smaller stuff like fog can be harder to deal with, harder to forecast than hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms.

2019,Opinion | Worry About Facebook. Rip Your Hair Out in Screaming Terror About Fox News.,"Novel forms of digital misinformation still pale in comparison with Fox News’ full-time hall of mirrors. Opinion Columnist At the risk of losing street cred as a tough-as-nails tech pundit, I’ll confess that I couldn’t muster much outrage when Facebook declined last week to delete a video doctored to make Nancy Pelosi look like a drunken mess. Sure, there’s a good argument that Facebook should have taken down the fake, as YouTube did. But what the company did do — label the clip as misinformation and limit its virality so that very few people got to see it — struck me as a reasonable effort to quash the lie, especially since I worry about Facebook’s overreach. Demanding that Facebook remove posts that cross some hard-to-define line may end up dragooning lots of legitimate political speech into its memory hole. Such a policy would also enrich Mark Zuckerberg with the last thing we should want him to have: more power over what we read, watch, listen to and think about. Mostly, though, I felt indifferent to the debate. Whatever Facebook decides to do with this weird little video is a big meh, because if you were to rank the monsters of misinformation that American society now faces, amateurishly doctored viral videos would clock in as mere houseflies in our midst. Worry about them, sure, but not at the risk of overlooking a more clear and present danger, the million-pound, forked-tongue colossus that dominates our misinformation menagerie: Fox News and the far-flung, cross-platform lie machine that it commands. [Farhad Manjoo will answer your questions about his column on Thursday at 2:30 p.m. Eastern: @fmanjoo] And that’s exactly what happened last week. In going after Facebook, many observers forgot about Rupert Murdoch’s empire, whose Fox Business spinoff aired a similarly misleading Pelosi hit job on “Lou Dobbs Tonight.” This was upside down. While newfangled digital manipulations should raise some concern, they are still emerging, long-range threats, and social networks are at least experimenting with ways to mitigate their negative impact on society. But we don’t have much hope nor many good ideas for limiting the lies of old-media outlets like Fox News, which still commands the complete and slavish attention of tens of millions of Americans every night, polluting the public square with big and small lies that often ricochet across every platform, from cable to YouTube to Facebook to Google, drowning us all in a never-ending flood of fakery. Indeed, what was remarkable about Fox’s Pelosi video was its very ordinariness. Instead of slowing down Pelosi’s speech, Fox Business misleadingly spliced together lots of small sections of a recent news conference to make it look as if Pelosi stammered worse than Porky Pig. Fox’s editing technique was not novel; this sort of montage is a common feature on Fox and much of cable news. The clip was aired with all the trappings of serious TV journalism. After showing the video, a Fox pundit, Greg Jarrett, and Ed Rollins, the longtime Republican political consultant, concern-trolled about how Pelosi, who “could not put a subject with a predicate in the same sentence,” was “getting worn down” by the demands of her “very big job.” Pelosi “STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE,” the chyron read. While Facebook moved quickly to limit the spread of the doctored Pelosi clip, Fox is neither apologizing for airing its montage nor taking it down, because this sort of manipulated video fits within the network’s ethical bounds. And Fox has apparently persuaded us all to live with its lying, too. Even though it was the Fox Business clip, not the amateur Facebook segment, that President Trump tweeted to his millions of followers, it was somehow Facebook, Twitter and the digital world that came in for the biggest scolding from press critics. I understand the fear about digital fakery. But to focus on Facebook instead of Fox News is to mistake the symptom for the disease. The disease is an entrenched, well-funded, decades-in-the-making, right-wing propaganda network, one that exists to turn faintly sourced rumors into full-blown, politically convenient narratives. The propaganda network’s tentacles now infiltrate every form of media — magazines, books, talk radio, social networks — but it still finds its most profitable and effective outlet in the Murdochs’ cable empire. And it is devastatingly effective: Just about every political lie that has dominated American discourse in the past two decades — the Swift Boaters and the birthers, death panels, the idea that undocumented immigrants pose an existential threat but climate change does not — depended, for its mainstream dissemination, on the Fox News machine. This makes sense when you look into the scholarship on misinformation. As Brendan Nyhan of the University of Michigan has pointed out, while it’s reasonable to worry about lies online, what we should really be up in arms about are the lies of “elites” — politicians, anchors, pundits and their spin doctors — who transform latent misinformation into comprehensive narratives of untruth. Not that this is a comforting thought; in fact, it makes the whole problem a bit hopeless, because what are we going to do about Fox News? Aside from Elizabeth Warren — who has a plan to limit the power of Fox, as she has a plan for everything (a caveat that is becoming a regular occurrence in my columns) — few on the left bother anymore to even mention the scourge it poses, because it’s all so obvious: Fox is fake, water is wet. But we should not grow inured to this. Because if we give up expecting truth from Fox, there’s little point expecting it on Facebook, either. Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.

2019,Would You Change Your Eating Habits to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint?,"Student Opinion What did you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday? Take this short quiz to find out how much your choices contribute to climate change. Then, tell us: How did you score? How do your eating habits compare with those of other Americans? In “Your Questions About Food and Climate Change, Answered,” Julia Moskin, Brad Plumer, Rebecca Lieberman and Eden Weingart answer questions about the impact that food shopping, cooking and eating habits have on climate change: Does what I eat have an effect on climate change? Yes. The world’s food system is responsible for about one-quarter of the planet-warming greenhouse gases that humans generate each year. That includes raising and harvesting all the plants, animals and animal products we eat — beef, chicken, fish, milk, lentils, kale, corn and more — as well as processing, packaging and shipping food to markets all over the world. If you eat food, you’re part of this system. How exactly does food contribute to global warming? Lots of ways. Here are four of the biggest: When forests are cleared to make room for farms and livestock — this happens on a daily basis in some parts of the world — large stores of carbon are released into the atmosphere, which heats up the planet. When cows, sheep and goats digest their food, they burp up methane, another potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Animal manure and rice paddies are also big methane sources. Finally, fossil fuels are used to operate farm machinery, make fertilizer and ship food around the globe, all of which generate emissions. Which foods have the largest impact? Meat and dairy, particularly from cows, have an outsize impact, with livestock accounting for around 14.5 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases each year. That’s roughly the same amount as the emissions from all the cars, trucks, airplanes and ships combined in the world today. In general, beef and lamb have the biggest climate footprint per gram of protein, while plant-based foods tend to have the smallest impact. Pork and chicken are somewhere in the middle. Is there a simple food choice I can make that would reduce my climate footprint? Consuming less red meat and dairy will typically have the biggest impact for most people in wealthy countries. That doesn’t necessarily mean going vegan. You might just eat less of the foods with the biggest climate footprints, like beef, lamb and cheese. If you’re looking for substitutes, pork, chicken, eggs and mollusks have a smaller footprint. But plant-based foods like beans, pulses, grains and soy tend to be the most climate-friendly options of all. How much would changing my diet actually help? It varies from person to person. But a number of studies have concluded that people who currently eat a meat-heavy diet — including much of the population of the United States and Europe — could shrink their food-related footprint by one-third or more by moving to a vegetarian diet. Giving up dairy would reduce those emissions even further. If you don’t want to go that far, there are still ways to shrink your individual footprint. Just eating less meat and dairy, and more plants, can reduce emissions. Cutting back on red meat in particular can make a surprisingly large difference: According to a World Resources Institute analysis, if the average American replaced a third of the beef he or she eats with pork, poultry or legumes, his or her food-related emissions would still fall by around 13 percent. Students, read the rest of the green “Big Picture” section of the article, then tell us: — What were the most interesting or surprising facts about climate change and food you learned? What questions do you still have? — How climate-friendly is your diet? Do you tend to eat a lot of meat and dairy? Or do your meals mostly consist of plant-based foods? How do you feel about the impact your eating habits have on the environment? — Why do you choose to eat the way you do? Do your parents do most of the meal planning, food shopping and cooking? Do you make any personal choices based on moral, religious, environmental or health reasons? Or, do you just simply eat what tastes good? — After the “Big Picture” introduction, the article goes on to detail five specific areas that contribute to climate change: Meat, Seafood, Dairy, Plants, and Shopping and Food Waste. Choose one and read the related section. What did you learn about this topic? If you were to alter your diet in this area to make it more environmentally-friendly, what changes would you have to make? How difficult would these changes be for you and why? — Now that you know more about the impact your eating habits have on the environment, would you actually be willing to change any of them to reduce your carbon footprint? If so, what specific changes would you make and why? If not, why not? Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Would You Let the Police Search Your Phone?,"We are much more likely to give consent than we think. Dr. Sommers is a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School. Dr. Bohns is an associate professor of organizational behavior at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell. Law enforcement officers on the doorstep threatening to “come back with a warrant” is a cliché of police procedural dramas. Things are much less dramatic in real life: The officers ask if they can take a look around, and the civilians say yes without putting up a fight. A key question in so-called “consent -search” cases is why people so readily agree to allow intrusions into their privacy. The answer, as we argue in a forthcoming article in The Yale Law Journal, is that psychologically, it’s much harder to refuse consent than it seems. The degree of pressure needed to get people to comply is shockingly minimal — and our ability to recognize this fact is limited. The legal standard for whether a consent search is voluntary — and thus whether any contraband police discover is admissible in court — is whether a reasonable person would have felt free to refuse the officers’ request. Courts tend to judge the voluntariness of consent by looking for clear markers of coercion. Did the officer phrase the request as a demand, instead of a question? Were weapons drawn? If not, the search is likely to be deemed voluntary. But this approach misunderstands the psychology of compliance. It takes much less pressure than it seems to secure people’s acquiescence. Police don’t need to use weapons to get people to accede to their requests; they just need to ask. Our research shows that a simple, polite face-to-face request is harder to refuse than we think. To test how the psychology of compliance operates, we recruited hundreds of participants to the lab. We approached half of them with a polite but audacious request: “Before we begin the study, can you please unlock your phone and hand it to me? I’ll just need to take your phone outside of the room for a moment to check for some things.” For the other half, we asked what a reasonable person would do if hypothetically approached by the same experimenter with the same request. Our control group, who merely imagined the interaction, said that most people would refuse to hand over the phone: Only 14 percent thought a reasonable person would let us search the phone, and only 28 percent said they would yield their phone to a stranger. But when we actually approached people, 97 percent handed over their phone. In addition, these participants reported feeling significantly more pressured to comply than the control group imagined feeling. The fact is, saying no is more difficult, and rarer, than we realize. We believe this same dynamic plays out the in the law surrounding consent searches. To be sure, saying no to a police officer is different from a saying no to an experimenter in a laboratory study. So we also tested whether people underestimate the pressure to comply with the police as well. We recruited a separate group of survey respondents and offered them a monetary bonus if they could predict how often drivers grant consent when stopped by the police. According to traffic data, upward of 90 percent of drivers say yes when the police ask to search their car. But our survey respondents’ average guess was far lower: They thought that only about 65 percent of drivers say yes. Again, people vastly understated compliance. [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private?Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.] This tendency to underappreciate the power of social influence is one of the most enduring and important findings in all of social psychology. In Stanley Milgram’s famous studies on obedience, for instance, research participants were willing to heed an experimenter’s instructions to administer dangerous electric shocks to an innocent, protesting victim. Mr. Milgram showed that normal people would commit violent acts — not because they were sadists, but because they were loath to disobey an authority figure’s directives. This was a result that no one, including expert psychologists, expected. Critics of consent searches have also been approaching the issue in the wrong way. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union have focused on advocating that the police be required to notify citizens of their right to refuse consent, much as the police are required to read custodial suspects their Miranda rights. But this is unlikely to address the psychological factors at play. [Technology has made our lives easier. But it also means that your data is no longer your own. We’ll examine who is hoarding your information — and give you a guide for what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.] In another study, we tested what happens when we tell people they “have the right to refuse”the request to search their phone. We found that this notification altered people’s beliefs about the consequences of refusal, but it did not change how free they felt to refuse. Nor did it reduce the rates at which they handed over their phone to us — a result consistent with previous studies that have found negligible effects of Miranda warnings on the rates at which suspects confess to crimes. The failure of “know your rights” interventions makes sense if you think about the psychology behind police-citizen interactions. Telling people about their rights addresses information deficits, but the real reason people comply is social, not informational. The social imperatives to comply with a police officer’s request persist even when people are properly informed of their rights or given a consent form to sign — or just asked politely.

Could Tevas, the sturdy, quick-drying sandal designed for water sports and other outdoor activities, be the shoe of summer 2019? A few brands are betting on it. In early May, the activewear start-up Outdoor Voices released a Teva collaboration with sandals marked by mismatched, color blocked straps. Within a week, the company said, most sizes had sold out on outdoorvoices.com. Instagram fed the frenzy; one commenter called the sandals “STUPID CUTE.” Another suggested: “Maybe they can make crocs cool again too.” At New York Fashion Week in September, upstart labels like Sandy Liang and Collina Strada showed their spring collections on models who wore simple black Hurricane Tevas (socks, too). Area, another brand, adorned its Tevas with a thick beaded fringe. At her runway show, Anna Sui debuted a collaboration with the company — colorful platforms whose straps were dotted with snakes and birds — that was released this spring. According to company lore, Teva’s Velcro sandals were created in 1984 by a river rafting guide who wanted to prevent his flip-flops from flying off his feet. The shoes soon came to stand for practicality and adventurousness. But in recent years, Tevas have stepped into new territory: everyday style and even runway fashion. Teva’s first fashion collaboration, with the New York-based label Grey Ant, came out in 2010. Media coverage of the chunky, sporty 4-inch stiletto sandal reveled in its novelty, but refrained from heralding it as the beginning of a Teva fashion moment. The company tried out some collaborations in Japan (a region that Erika Gabrielli, Teva’s senior director of global marketing, described as “hungry and looking for newness”) before making fashion partnerships a bigger part of its strategy. Then, in 2014, Teva rolled out a collection with Opening Ceremony: classic styles updated with extra straps, buckles and graphic fabrics. That collaboration, which Ms. Gabrielli sees as Teva’s “first real fashion launch,” was reprised in 2015 and 2016. Since then, Teva has worked with partners like the singer Jhené Aiko, the upscale outdoors brand Snow Peak and Herschel Supply Co., which sells a multitude of hipster-baiting backpacks. The company has also established a presence on the music-festival circuit. On Instagram, the hashtag #teva yields about 247,000 posts, many of the #ootd (outfit of the day) and #festivalstyle varieties. On Twitter, the Teva discourse is a bit more self-mocking. Tevas — often grouped with Birkenstocks, Dansko clogs, Uggs and Crocs as “ugly shoes” — are popular in part because of their outsider status. “There’s something so normal about them that if you’re a fashion person and wear them it’s kind of funny and cool,” said the stylist Kate Young, whose clients include Selena Gomez and Sophie Turner, in an email. But that doesn’t rule out genuine appreciation for their functional design: Ms. Young wears Tevas in the summer while camping and swimming in streams with slippery rocks. “They were way too crunchy for me when I first saw them. Lately they hold this sort of nostalgic minimal sport appeal for me,” she said. “I do wear the version The Row made in the city all the time and I think they’re dead chic.” Others, like Marc Jacobs and Miuccia Prada, have offered their own takes on the sandal. The ascent of Tevas has coincided with the rise of “gorpcore,” a term coined by the writer Jason Chen to describe the rise of everyday technical gear. Patagonia fleeces are now the stuff of GQ style guides, the brand’s image bolstered by its stance against the Trump administration’s environmental policies. In addition to featuring Tevas in her spring 2019 presentation, Sandy Liang has developed a cult following around her own fleece jackets, which are sensible and stylish, with their leopard prints and neon linings. Tyler Haney, the C.E.O. of Outdoor Voices, said that Tevas were a common sight around the brand’s Austin headquarters well before the collaboration’s release. Even Ms. Sui, a mainstay of New York fashion, has been wearing Tevas for years, usually when taking her nieces and nephews on vacation to rocky European beaches. “I thought they were brilliant because they were like not wearing shoes, they were so comfortable, but protected your feet,” she said, adding that the adjustable toe and ankle straps “hit in very strategic places so that they look good.” (Ms. Sui doesn’t count Tevas as ugly shoes.) She believes that the current interest in Tevas is a function of the cultural dominance of sneakers, as comfort has come to trump formality at work and in daily life. The sandals from her collaboration are snazzier than many of its in-house styles, but at the end of the day, they’re still dependable, pillowy Tevas. “Once you start wearing sneakers or comfortable shoes, it’s really hard to go back,” Ms. Sui said. “I never understood women who would carry their Manolos in their handbag and wear sneakers on the subway. Now I get it.”",The New York Times
2019,Wreck of Migrant Ship That Killed Hundreds Will Be Displayed at Venice Biennale,"A fishing vessel that sank off the Libyan coast in April 2015, trapping hundreds of migrants in its hull, is the centerpiece of a new art project by the Swiss-Icelandic artist Christoph Büchel at the 58th Biennale di Venezia, which opens this week. The wreck will be exhibited in the Arsenale, the former shipyards and armories that provided the Venetian Republic with its formidable naval power for centuries. Areas of the Arsenale have lately been turned into an exhibition space for the Biennale. Mr. Büchel declined to be interviewed ahead of the project’s presentation on Monday, but a news release for “Barca Nostra,” which means “Our Ship” in Italian, describes the vessel as “a relic of a human tragedy but also a monument to contemporary migration, engaging real and symbolic borders and the (im)possibility of freedom of movement of information and people.” The relic underscores “our mutual responsibility representing the collective policies and politics that create such wrecks,” the statement added. At least 800 people are believed to have died in the capsizing of the vessel on April 18, 2015, when the boat, crammed with migrants, collided with a Portuguese freighter ship that had been called to its aid. Only 28 people survived the accident, one of the deadliest shipwrecks in the Mediterranean in living memory. The disaster accounted for nearly a fifth of the estimated 3,665 migrant deaths in the sea that year, as tallied by the International Organization for Migration. The Tunisian captain of the fishing vessel was later sentenced to 18 years in prison after being found guilty of charges including multiple manslaughter and human trafficking. At the time of the disaster, Mr. Büchel was working on a project for the 56th Venice Biennale: a working mosque inside a disused Venetian church that officials closed not long after its inauguration, citing security concerns. Mr. Büchel made fresh headlines last year when he created an online petition to preserve and have designated as national monuments eight prototypes for President Trump’s proposed border wall between the United States and Mexico. The Biennale piece seeks to be equally thought-provoking. In June 2016, the wreck of the fishing vessel was recovered from the seabed and taken to a NATO base on Sicily, where teams of forensic scientists and experts began the difficult task of identifying the corpses that had been trapped in the hull. The wreck’s symbolic power was immediately apparent, and various proposals were put forward regarding its future use. Italian news media reported in 2016 that the movie director Alejandro González Iñárritu wanted to display the boat in front of the Gothic cathedral in Milan to coincide with a visit by Pope Francis. But Cettina Saraceno, a spokeswoman for the Comitato 18 Aprile, an association established to preserve the memory of the tragedy, said that Mr. Büchel had been the first artist to ask to use the vessel. “It seemed to us like a valid project,” Ms. Saraceno said in a telephone interview. The wreck has been entrusted to the Sicilian city of Augusta, which is working with the committee to find a space for it at the heart of what Ms. Saraceno said would be a “garden of memory.” The vessel will return to Augusta after the Biennale. “It is the right moment” for the Biennale project and for the garden, Ms. Saraceno said.",The New York Times
2019,"Writing About Teenager Who Makes Sex Videos, School Paper Becomes the News","The Bear Creek High School newspaper has profiled notable students — athletes, budding entrepreneurs, academic whizzes — without incident for decades. But an article that appeared Friday in The Bruin Voice caused an uproar over free speech, feminism and student journalism, all before it was even published. The 18-year-old subject is a senior at the school in Stockton, Calif., one of more than 2,100 students. She also makes her own pornographic videos. The story about the story follows a pattern similar to other clashes between student journalists and school boards. The Lodi Unified School District, after learning about the planned profile, demanded last month that it be turned over for review before appearing online and in print. The attempted oversight drew far more attention than the article probably would have. The district said the piece might violate a state rule that it said prevented publications at public schools from featuring “obscenity, defamation and incitement,” and it threatened to fire Katherine Duffel, the paper’s longtime faculty adviser. In articles, columns, television programs and social media posts, the standoff over an unpublished story became either a symbol of censorship and women’s rights, or the loss of traditional values and a school district’s responsibility to protect young students from harmful content. People from all over the country weighed in. Someone sent the paper a $250 donation. One woman sent $100 and asked for a sneak peek of the article. Hilde Lysiak, who publishes a local paper in Pennsylvania and is, at age 12, the youngest member of the Society of Professional Journalists, offered to flood the Bear Creek campus with copies of the story if the district blocked The Voice from publishing it. “It’s been pretty hectic — we weren’t expecting so much feedback,” said Bailey Kirkeby, 17, the article’s author. “I’m a little scared that it’s hyped up too much and that when people read it, it’s going to be anticlimactic.” In the end, the district decided not to block publication. But its lawyers did send a letter to an attorney representing both Ms. Duffel and Ms. Kirkeby, asking that The Voice publish a disclaimer stating that the district did not endorse the article. The Voice refused to do that, according to the lawyer, Matthew Cate. In the letter, the district told Mr. Cate that it still had the right to review all material scheduled to appear in the newspaper and that it had the right to block an article. It also accused Ms. Duffel of insubordination. “Students and journalism advisers face a lot of pressure from districts and others in positions of authority, and there’s a serious imbalance of power that can be easy to give in to,” said Mr. Cate, who shared the letter with The New York Times. The letter also raised concerns that underage journalists may have been exposed to pornography while pursuing the story, and that the student, Caitlin Fink, may have “been exploited before reaching legal age” in “an industry that is at best notoriously poorly regulated, if not abusive and exploitative.” On Friday, the district said it was “very pleased” that the exchanges with the paper had “resulted in an article that meets legal requirements.” “We know that these experiences regarding controversies and debates help prepare our students to be successful as they pursue future efforts of higher education and career,” the district said in a statement. The nearly 1,100-word article explores Ms. Fink’s path to the adult entertainment industry. In it, she explained that she sold erotic photographs of herself on messaging and dating apps like Kik and Tinder, initially for the money but later because she enjoyed the attention. She left home and now lives with a friend’s family, paying some $300 a month for food, utilities and rent, according to the profile. “The only hard thing so far is making sure I have enough money,” she told the paper. The piece also mentioned that she had fallen victim to scams, that her body acne had once disrupted a planned shoot and that she had faced threats. Here’s an excerpt from the piece: Although Fink makes a livable income through her adult entertainment career, as well as her second job as a dish washer, she admits the industry is not always glamorous; workers are constantly at risk of being taken advantage of due to their occupation. “People assume that just because you’re in the industry, you would do sexual things with anyone, and that isn’t true,” Fink said. “Adult entertainment is a job just like any other job. There’s always that risk of getting kidnapped or possibly not even knowing what to do after your career is over and trying to find work after that.” Ms. Fink told The Times that she had been making her own online pornographic videos since turning 18 in September. She also began working as a stripper recently. She said she was enthusiastic about being profiled in The Voice, seeing the article as a way to address rumors and meanspirited gossip about her work in pornography. “I don’t see the story as too taboo — I want to inform people about this topic, that it’s not just all fun and games the entire time,” Ms. Fink said. “I know for a fact that I’m not the only person at school that’s thought about porn.” The story of the paper’s standoff with the school district has been reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, The Associated Press and The Washington Post. Ms. Fink said she hoped that the publicity would have “a positive effect” on her career: maybe some scenes in movies, “possibly new friends in the industry.” The school district’s involvement with the article “shocked” the group of teenagers behind The Bruin Voice, an eight-page paper produced through an elective class, said Ms. Kirkeby, the managing editor and news editor. The last time The Voice was so at odds with officials, the principal at the time confiscated 1,700 copies after it criticized the school’s safety policy. The principal later released them on the district’s orders. “It was the same as the profiles we do for every issue, like a star athlete; just a student sharing her story,” Ms. Kirkeby said of Ms. Fink’s profile. Friday’s issue is the fifth of the year. After receiving copies from the printer, students stuff them with an advertisement — such as a coupon for a $10 discount on a driver’s education class — and then distribute them to classrooms. Ms. Duffel, an English teacher with a journalism degree and a love of Hemingway, has overseen the paper since the school was founded in 1991. Each year, she said, students pitch stories about teenagers and sex. The feature about Ms. Fink is part of a special section about sex, including pieces about blood-donation rules for gay and bisexual men and a film focused on the founder of Planned Parenthood. “It’s just the word ‘pornography’ and where people’s minds go,” Ms. Duffel said of the tussle over Ms. Fink’s profile. “I think they lose their minds, quite frankly, when they hear that word.”",The New York Times
2019,XX Marks the Spot: KAWS Goes Global,"The artist known as KAWS is famous for his commercial collaborations. Now his paintings are fetching ever-higher auction prices. Many art careers are made from the top down: A museum show typically provides the seal of approval that propels a young artist to success in the commercial world. But KAWS — the nom-d’art of Brian Donnelly — took another direction. He became a popular juggernaut thanks to the simple, graphic and recognizable characters he invented — like “Companion,” his version of Mickey Mouse — that riff on famous cartoon figures and have XXs for eyes. First he sketched them, then he inserted them, illegally, into the sides of phone booths, and soon they became the staples of toys, T-shirts and commercial collaboration of all stripes, giving him 1.9 million followers on Instagram. Mr. Donnelly had a streetwear store in Tokyo, OriginalFake (2006-13), before he ever had a solo museum show. [This week, contemporary art sales brought in $981 million, led by Jeff Koons and KAWS] Only in the last few years has his renown translated into institutional recognition, but it will be 2021 before he finally has his first New York star turn in a survey at the Brooklyn Museum. He’s already earning big auction prices, however, like the $14.8 million paid at Sotheby’s Hong Kong in March for his painting “The KAWS Album” (2005), a mash-up of “The Simpsons” and the cover of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” It was a record for his work — almost 20 times the low estimate — and it stopped many experts in their tracks. “My trajectory has been from the bottom up,” the 44-year-old artist said last month, sitting in his well-appointed Williamsburg studio, one of two he operates in Brooklyn. And the easygoing artist seemed fine with that. Mr. Donnelly — a former graffiti tagger who grew up taking the PATH train into the city from his hometown, Jersey City, to hang out at Canal Jeans — created the name KAWS to “live vicariously through the work,” he said, adding, “I don’t feel any need to create attention for myself.” That may be difficult after this week, when four of his paintings are coming up for bid during the spring evening auction sales, offering his take on the Smurfs, SpongeBob SquarePants and Snoopy. On Wednesday, Christie’s Post-War and Contemporary auction featured “Kurfs (Tangle)” from 2009; the work sold for $2.6 million, well over its high estimate of $800,000. On Thursday Sotheby’s offered “Kurf (Hot Dog)” from 2008, which sold for $2.6 million, over its high estimate of $2 million. Also on Thursday Phillips sold “The Walk Home” from 2012 for $5.9 million, well over its high estimate of $800,000 and “Untitled (MBFU9)” from 2015 for $1.3 million, well over its high estimate of $500,000. Some experts have put KAWS’s work in the category of street art, which is undergoing the same transition that Pop Art made in the 1960s and 1970s. “His work is universal, and it transcends the traditional market,” argued David Galperin, head of Sotheby’s contemporary art evening auctions in New York. “It bridges fine art and commercial art, and that taps into a global, deep audience.” Even so, Mr. Galperin added that the March Hong Kong record “surprised all of us.” Last year was the first time KAWS work was even included in an evening sale at the big houses, showing just how far and fast his reputation has moved. Mr. Donnelly expressed his feelings about the Hong Kong sale on Instagram: “Do I think my work should sell for this much? No.” In an interview he noted the obvious — artists don’t see a check from an auction sale unless they consigned the work — but he acknowledged that it adds luster to a career: “I think you’d be kind of naïve to think that it doesn’t affect you in some way.” Mr. Donnelly does not lack for ambition or activity. He has a just-opened show at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, “KAWS: Alone Again,” on view until August 4. He shows with two prestigious galleries, Perrotin and Skarstedt, and he has an ongoing collaboration called KAWS x Dior, with the French fashion house, involving sculptures for runway shows and store displays. He is surely the only artist working with both Dior and Cookie Monster; his KAWS x Sesame Street collection debuted at Uniqlo in the fall. Last month, Mr. Donnelly’s studio was full of sharply delineated and brightly colored, abstract paintings in progress — there were no cute characters in these works, but they still bear his deep influence from comics and cartoons. He favors a very thin type of paint, similar to that used for cel animation. “I’ve always just really liked color,” said Mr. Donnelly of the puzzle-like shapes he was working on. He draws the images and does a first and last paint coat himself, with middle paint layers done by assistants. “You bring in these muted ones and it’s really what gets the others to pop,” he added. Though paintings may dominate the auction offerings this week, his three-dimensional work has brought him much renown. At the time of his Hong Kong record sale, Mr. Donnelly had a 121-foot-long inflatable sculpture, “Companion,” floating in the city’s Victoria Harbor. The fourth in a series, organized by the Hong Kong studio AllRightsReserved, will be installed in July at Mount Fuji in Japan. Michael Rooks, a curator at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta who put on a KAWS show in 2011—12, said that such projects are why “KAWS has had an enormous impact on visual culture across the globe.” For their part, museums have been traditionally suspicious of things that have too much mass appeal. “It makes the art world uncomfortable,” said Anne Pasternak, the director of the Brooklyn Museum. “But Brian doesn’t respect those traditional hierarchies.” Ms. Pasternak took time to come around, too. “I didn’t see the appeal initially,” she said of his work. “But artists love him. They all said, ‘Go visit him. ’And I’ve learned to listen to artists.” Asked if he still felt unwelcome in the high culture citadel at times, Mr. Donnelly laughed and said, “Yeah, all the time. There’s a sense that you can be a commercial artist or a fine artist, but you cannot do both.” The visibility of artists like Takashi Murakami, who had a large show at the Brooklyn Museum in 2008, likely helped pave the way. In featuring Mr. Donnelly’s work, museums are making an explicit play for younger viewers. “KAWS is someone I know is loved by my board members’ grandchildren,” said Elysia Borowy-Reeder, executive director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. “Millennials and young people are our future supporters and collectors.” The KAWS characters are sometimes slumped over or have their heads in their hands, and the High’s Mr. Rooks — who sees Mr. Donnelly as a clear heir to Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein in building on pop culture imagery — emphasized the emotional connection that Mr. Donnelly makes. “There’s no cynicism in his work,” Mr. Rooks said, though he didn’t weigh in on whether the characters could be seen as gentle criticism of old animation tropes. “There’s a level of tenderness that communicates to millennials and emerging generations who have anxiety and existential angst.” Mr. Donnelly is also an avid collector, and his studio is full of works by Peter Saul, Keith Haring, Jim Nutt and others who have been influenced by animation culture. “I always visually gravitated toward comics, but I wasn’t somebody who read every story,” he said of his Jersey City childhood, which was much more about finding places to skateboard than see art. “I wasn’t taken to galleries.” He attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and then started traveling to Japan, further embedding himself in the cartoon aesthetic. In the 1990s the KAWS name became associated with on-the-fly Manhattan street projects. “I haven’t painted illegally since about 2001,” Mr. Donnelly said. With age came a more conventional life: He’s married to an artist and has two young children. Given the toys and characters he’s surrounded by at all times, “I had to have kids just to make it not seem weird,” Mr. Donnelly joked. In a season when he seems to have it all — the fun of childlike pursuits plus serious auction clout and designing stores for Dior — he made no apologies for his low-to-high success. But he did it in his soft-spoken way. “Honestly to me, it would be weird to be an artist these days and not be working in all these spaces simultaneously,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Xavier Dolan Has Gone to Cannes for 10 Years. It Hasn’t Gotten Easier.,"CANNES, France — The Quebecois director Xavier Dolan has had more movies play at the Cannes Film Festival than most auteurs will ever get to make. His first, “I Killed My Mother,” debuted on the Croisette when Dolan was just 20, and he has directed seven more since, nearly all of which have received a Cannes berth. Sometimes, the Cannes premiere has been as wonderful as a filmmaker could hope for, like when Dolan’s 2014 film, “Mommy,” won best-of-career raves and tied for a jury prize with Jean-Luc Godard. Other times, the experience is more complicated: Dolan earned the Grand Prix three years ago for “It’s Only the End of the World,” but the film was dogged by such scathing reviews that Dolan claimed the whole endeavor left him a physical wreck. Now 30, Dolan has returned to the festival with “Matthias and Maxime,” which tells the intimate story of two friends (played by Dolan and Gabriel D’Almeida Freitas) who are asked to kiss on camera for a short film, though the smooch stirs feelings that they’re not sure how to deal with. “It’s love, and they wonder if it’s gay,” Dolan told me Friday at a beach club on the Côte d’Azur. “I’ve lived with the ambiguity of men my entire life — men who wanted to sleep with me and told me, ‘No, I’m not gay.’” “Matthias and Maxime” mostly eschews the sweeping pop maximalism of Dolan’s last film, “The Death and Life of John F. Donovan,” which starred big names like Natalie Portman and Kit Harington but has had trouble securing American distribution since its Toronto International Film Festival premiere last fall. How will “Matthias and Maxime” fare beyond the festival circuit? A candid Dolan told me he hoped for the best. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation. How does this Cannes experience differ from the others? It’s just very discombobulating. I don’t even know where I stand. It’s very hard to build confidence and try to believe in yourself and come here. I don’t even know if we belong to this competition. I feel like I came here underdressed, when it comes to the film. I don’t know about underdressed, but “Matthias and Maxime” definitely feels more unadorned and stripped-down than your previous films. That’s what we wanted to do, but it’s tricky. I spent my entire 20s feeling like I was too much, and I’ve tried to strip down a layer of color and texture and intensity. And I feel like now, it’s not enough. You feel like that’s the critical reaction? I have a feeling that something’s missing. I’ve been coming here 10 years, and it’s really hard to evolve here as an artist. I want to grow, but then when you change, people tell you, “Why didn’t you make the same film?” I’m disappointed in myself because I wanted to come here with my friends, and I made this film for them. I said, “If everything goes well, we’ll go to Cannes and I’ll show you this incredible atmosphere.” How did you feel as you walked up the red carpet with them? I realized in my stupid little heart when we were out there, I wasn’t as free as I wanted to be. In their company, I was sort of outside of my body. It went so fast and so quickly that I felt like I didn’t really live it. Do you think you’ll get U.S. distribution for this? I don’t think I will. No. You want to bet? One hundred thousand dollars. I don’t have that kind of money! I don’t have it either. You’re obviously willing to wear your heart on your sleeve, but what I found fascinating about the mostly heterosexual group of friends that Matthias and Maxime are a part of is that every time someone gets a little vulnerable, they get made fun of. It’s good-natured ribbing, but it also feels like a reinforcement of masculinity. The movie is about toxic notions of masculinity we’ve been given by society, but this group of friends, all of them feel very liberal, very accepting. In this group, homosexuality is clearly not a problem for anyone, and no one seems shocked by the existence of that kiss. The only characters that are troubled by it are the lead characters, because their notions of masculinity and how they see themselves are threatened by the kiss. The two characters are at a place where they might be young, but they’re not young enough to be part of this new generation that feels so much more freedom and independence from labels. When I graduated from high school, a guy kissing a guy was “gay” and a guy kissing a girl was “straight.” Notions of sexuality and gender were not as evolved, and thank God they are now, but it doesn’t mean we don’t still have blockages in our mind that keep us from embracing these possibilities. That’s what the characters in the film are dealing with: “Will I still be a man in the eyes of my male friends and my girlfriend and my mother if they only knew this kiss was haunting me?” And on an emotional level, can you discover new feelings for someone and take the risk of change when everything is established in your life quite orderly? No matter how accepting society becomes, there will still be people wrestling with their sexuality because it could redefine the way people will think of you, or maybe even the way you think about yourself. That’s my point. Are we straight or gay by nature? I know for a fact, and I think everyone does, that I’m entirely homosexual. [Laughs.] Even if I tried — and I did — I couldn’t have a heterosexual relationship or intercourse. That’s something that’s been extremely frustrating my entire life, because it would have brought a diversity to my life that probably would have made me feel much less lonely. You dedicate “Matthias and Maxime” to the directors of four recent gay-themed movies, Eliza Hittman (“Beach Rats”), Luca Guadagnino (“Call Me by Your Name”), Joel Edgerton (“Boy Erased”) and Francis Lee (“God’s Own Country”). What kind of effect have they had on you? Someone once asked me, “Why are your movies always about homosexuals? Couldn’t it be heterosexuals?” And a part of my mind didn’t forget that, even though I tried to. You know, the kid in “Mommy” was supposed to be gay. I decided that it wasn’t a narrative element that seemed meaningful, so we left it out, but I wonder: Did I do that because I feel shame for my sexuality? But when I read the script for “Boy Erased,” I was so impressed that Joel would adapt this story as a heterosexual. That he would feel such a deep connection with the story moved me in a way that felt like a departure from something. And then I saw “Beach Rats” and the other movies, and it felt like I had lied to myself about what I wanted to make. In “It’s Only the End of the World,” there’s a [gay] sex scene, but it’s not too daring or physical — God forbid we see someone’s ass. I realized I felt shame about how honest I could be. Of course it’s not a problem for me to film heterosexual love, but I’m here as a human being, making films that are very close to me, and there’s no reason for me to feel coy about my sexuality. Making “Matthias and Maxime” was a way for me to tell a love story about two men, which I realized I had never really done. The gay movies that you were inspired by also have really dedicated teenage-girl fanbases. I feel aroused by a lot of heterosexual romance I’ve seen, and in the same way, I would hope this movie would feel arousing and sensual to everyone. You can guess that the greatest thing for me would be for a young heterosexual man to come to me and say, “I loved the kiss scene.” And they have! That’s always vastly satisfying, because you feel like you go beyond the limits people forced on themselves sexually. In the end, cinematic desire doesn’t belong to any given sexuality. I actually … well, I can’t even tell you this. You can’t start a sentence like that and not tell me, Xavier. There’s a woman who told me she was so deeply aroused by the kissing scene during the festival that she went home and masturbated. I was just like, “Yes, girl! Thank you.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Xi Jinping Wanted Global Dominance. He Overshot.,"China wasn’t ready for the trade war with the United States. Mr. Lian is a former lead writer and chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal. The endgame in the trade war between China and the United States seems near. President Trump, betting with real currency — American strength — apparently has the upper hand, and the concessions President Xi Jinping is likely to make won’t be mere tokens. When — if? — an agreement is finally announced, Mr. Trump will surely fire off bragging tweets, partly to shore up his credentials for a second term, amid personal and policy troubles. For Mr. Xi, almost any deal could mean a very serious loss of face. Mr. Xi assumed power when China was still riding high on its so-called economic miracle (and the United States remained mired in the aftereffects of the 2008-9 recession). He became general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) in late 2012 and president of the People’s Republic in early 2013. His anticorruption campaign was instantly popular. He championed the “Chinese Dream,” a vague vision of prosperity, strength and well-being for the country and its people, that seemed to fire up many citizens. His proposal to President Barack Obama to establish a “New Model of Major Country Relations” could only please Han-majority Chinese with imperial yearnings. But those were easy stunts, performed in a country with no audible opposition and that bans “reckless” talk about the government. The trade war, on the other hand, is the first real occasion to assess Mr. Xi’s leadership capabilities. And his performance might not look so good, even if one discounts the setbacks related to the trade war. First and foremost, Mr. Xi has utterly failed to manage the United States–Chinese relationship. In contrast, every Chinese leader since the founding of the communist state in 1949 had recognized the paramount importance of those ties, worked hard to improve them — and reaped huge benefits. Mao staged Ping-Pong diplomacy to break the ice in 1971, and President Nixon supported him in his standoff against the Soviet Union. Deng Xiaoping went all-out to woo the United States, and President Jimmy Carter switched recognition of China from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. During the 1980s, the C.C.P. leaders Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang invited Milton Friedman and other American economists to visit and provide advice; after that, American capital and technology started flowing into China. In 1997, Jiang Zemin made an eight-day visit to the United States — at one point, while in Williamsburg, Va., putting on a three-cornered colonial hat. Bill Clinton then gave China a strong push to enter the World Trade Organization in 2001. The Hu Jintao years, 2003–13, saw China’s most tactful exploitation of American openness (and naïveté). Cheap Chinese imports created runaway bilateral trade deficits for the United States. The Confucius Institutes, a network of language schools cum influence agencies, began to take root in American universities and high schools. (Today, there are more than 100 throughout the United States.) Chinese venture capitalists flooded Silicon Valley with money raised in American financial markets — then quietly siphoned off cutting-edge American expertise and injected it into China’s own high-tech hub. But Mr. Xi has been aggressively hard-line. Under him, anti-American rhetoric has spread in official media. The Chinese government has been explicit about wanting to challenge the United States’s military presence in Asia. It has made aggressive moves toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It has sent Chinese battleships through American waters off the coast of Alaska. (It claimed to only be exercising the internationally recognized right of “innocent passage,” but the move clearly was a show of force.) State authorities in Beijing try to co-opt members of China’s vast diaspora, hoping to develop a network that will facilitate political infiltration into other countries and high-tech transfers out of them. To this end, they resort to both overt schemes, like the Thousand Talents Plan, an official headhunting program, and covert tactics overseen by the C.C.P.’s influence machine, the United Front. These efforts have set off alarms among some Americans. In 2017 and 2018, two groups of blue-ribbon scholars and ex-officials from previous United States administrations advocated a fundamental change in America’s view of China. Their members were moderates and mostly well-disposed toward China. Yet some of their recommendations dovetailed with the views of the Trump administration hawks who consider China to be America’s number-one enemy and security threat. Mr. Xi, apparently oblivious to this sea change, was caught unprepared when Mr. Trump hit China with a tariff war. The dispute is having a knock-on effect elsewhere in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and Europe. After a summit in Brussels last month, China agreed to grant European Union countries “improved” market access, stop the forced transfer of technology and discuss the possibility of curtailing state subsidies to Chinese companies, which, other governments say, gives them an unfair competitive advantage. Although these concessions were presented in the mild, mutual-promise language of a joint statement, they were a clear setback for China and will blunt its global ambitions. Why is all of this happening under Mr. Xi? History suggests an answer. In the late 1950s, Mao began to challenge the Soviet Union’s leadership of the international communist movement, then a potent force that hoped to overturn the United States-led world order. Mao was also seeking global dominance, in line with the traditional concept that the emperor of the Middle Kingdom was the rightful ruler of “tian xia” (天下), everything under the heavens. But Mao overreached; China wasn’t strong enough for that then. The Soviet Union’s decision to scrap aid programs to China and pull out its scientific and technological advisers there dealt a severe blow to China’s underperforming socialist economy. Like Mao with the Soviets, Mr. Xi may have challenged the global leadership of the United States too hard and too soon. Mr. Xi’s second major shortcoming has been his failure to articulate a coherent set of policies to stop the Chinese economy’s long-term weakening, after many years of stellar performance. China’s gross-domestic-product growth in 2018 was the weakest in 28 years. The figure for the first quarter of this year was 6.4 percent, compared with the record high of 15.4 percent for the same period in 1993. Even that number would be the envy of many Western states, but the decline should concern China’s leadership because it underlines the country’s structural problems — notably, a rapidly graying population, a shrinking labor force and a total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio that neared 300 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The Japanese bank Nomura has estimated that defaults on bonds denominated in renminbi (also known as yuan) quadrupled between 2017 and 2018. Weighed down by demographics and debt, China can hardly expand through more private investment and consumption. Worse, since its economy already has some huge excess capacities (think newly built ghost towns), government stimulus isn’t very effective. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2008, it took one trillion yuan of credit to generate one trillion yuan of economic output; by 2017, the ratio was 3.5-to-1. Yet Xi has done little to address these structural issues. Evidence of severe demographic problems had become apparent by the late 2000s, but in 2016 Mr. Xi merely replaced the one-child policy with a two-child policy. Too little, too late. China’s number of newborns per year has dropped since the changes. The 2018 total was the lowest since 1961, a year struck by a terrible famine. Mr. Xi signed off on an economic stimulus package in 2015 that was 25 percent larger than his predecessor’s emergency plan in 2009, which had been implemented as a response to the global financial crisis. And again, in January and February of this year alone, even while Mr. Xi has been paying lip service to the need to wean the economy off state support, the government offered new loans and financing exceeding the package for all of 2015, according to an article in Forbes. A third criticism of Mr. Xi is that under him, China has sponsored or condoned actions by Chinese citizens and entities worldwide that have damaged the country’s international reputation while degrading its own moral fabric. Take intellectual property, for example. The United States seems to have hard evidence that it was the policy of Huawei, a flagship Chinese high-tech company, to reward employees for I.P. theft. And, as I have written before, such a policy is encouraged, arguably even mandatory, under China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law. Traditionally, the ideal Chinese state is a Confucian state that adheres to strict moral and behavioral norms. Yet for all his cracking down on corruption at home, Mr. Xi has encouraged moral turpitude abroad; his vision of China is a nation of patriotic thieves. All Chinese arguably have lost face as a result, and now innocent people overseas may be dismissed out of hand as guilty by association. Mr. Xi is widely seen as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao. After the Constitution was amended last year, he could be president for life — unless his serious failures of leadership give his opponents at home enough reason to cut him short.

2019,Yael Stone Is Identified as ‘Witness X’ in Geoffrey Rush Defamation Case,"SYDNEY, Australia — A mystery witness who lawyers had hoped would provide evidence of an alleged pattern of inappropriate behavior by the actor Geoffrey Rush in his defamation battle against Rupert Murdoch’s Nationwide News has been formally identified as the Australian actress Yael Stone. The Federal Court of Australia on Friday lifted an order suppressing the identity of “witness X,” as she was originally called, revealing her to be Ms. Stone, who is best known for her work in the Netflix series “Orange Is the New Black.” In an interview published in December, Ms. Stone, 34, told The New York Times that Mr. Rush danced naked in front of her when both were starring in a 2010-11 Sydney production of “The Diary of a Madman.” She also alleged that he used a mirror to watch her while she was in the shower and sent her sexually suggestive text messages. At the time of the alleged incidents, she was 25 years old and Mr. Rush was 59. [Read Yael Stone’s interview with The New York Times about Geoffrey Rush.] The identification of Ms. Stone inserts a potential new element into the legal battle over Mr. Rush’s reputation, just a month after he won his defamation suit against Nationwide News, which publishes the Sydney tabloid newspaper The Daily Telegraph. Mr. Rush was awarded 850,000 Australian dollars, or nearly $600,000, in initial damages. Damages for his economic losses are still to be determined, but could run into the millions of dollars. Mr. Rush, 67, argued during the trial that two front-page articles published in The Daily Telegraph in late 2017 wrongly portrayed him as a “sexual predator” and a “pervert.” The articles suggested that the Oscar-winning actor behaved inappropriately toward an unnamed female co-star, later revealed to be Eryn Jean Norvill, during a 2015-16 Sydney Theater Company production of “King Lear.” One article was accompanied by a photograph of Mr. Rush in character with the headline “King Leer.” Midway through the two-week trial late last year, Nationwide News called on Ms. Stone (then known publicly only as witness X) to provide evidence in its defense. However, Justice Michael Wigney rejected the last-minute bid and ordered Ms. Stone’s identity suppressed. Nationwide News is now appealing the defamation verdict. A key element of the appeal is that the judge refused the publisher’s application to amend its defense to include evidence from Ms. Stone. Nationwide News has also requested that Justice Wigney recuse himself from hearing the application. “One of the issues that the appeal court will need to decide is whether or not the judge made the right decision when deciding to exclude that evidence,” said Sophie Dawson, a Sydney-based partner at the law firm Bird & Bird and an expert in media and defamation law. “The fact that Yael Stone has been revealed as witness X doesn’t really change a lot for the case at this stage — it is likely that the court knew her identity,” Ms. Dawson said. “The lifting of the suppression order has just made it available to the public.” Lawyers for both Mr. Rush and Ms. Stone refused to comment. The court has continued to suppress the exact nature of Ms. Stone’s allegations against Mr. Rush. In her December 2018 interview with The Times, Ms. Stone recalled, in particular, an incident with Mr. Rush in the shared dressing room showers. “I remember I looked up to see there was a small shaving mirror over the top of the partition between the showers and he was using it to look down at my naked body,” she said in the interview. “I believe that it was meant with a playful intention, but the effect was that I felt there was nowhere for me to feel safe and unobserved.” She added of her decision to come forward: “I feel a responsibility to speak.” In a statement, Mr. Rush said that Ms. Stone’s allegations “are incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context.” “Clearly Yael has been upset on occasion by the spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work,” he said. “I sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress.” OpinionBari Weiss",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Beat Rays With a Taste of Their Own Medicine,"Yankees 13, Rays 5 On the one-year anniversary of the Tampa Bay Rays’ first use of a so-called opener, the Yankees copied the concept, having Chad Green, a reliever, start the game before handing off to another reliever, Nestor Cortes Jr. The concept did not exactly work to perfection for the Yankees, with Green and Cortes combining to allow five runs over five and two-thirds innings. But holding their own without the help of a traditional starter, Green and Cortes kept things tied at 5-5 before the Yankees’ bats exploded for a seven-run sixth inning. The end result was a 13-5 victory, with the Yankees, who have won two series against Tampa Bay over the last week, claiming a half-game lead in the American League East. For the Yankees, the adoption of the strategy, which Tampa Bay initiated with Sergio Romo on May 19, 2018, came as a result of an injury to James Paxton, who said he would need at least one more bullpen session before returning to a game. The Yankees’ execution on Sunday was only “O.K.” in the pitching coach Larry Rothschild’s assessment. But Rothschild said he had seen the concept’s potential because the staff’s number of elite relievers matched Tampa Bay’s. Last year, the Rays allowed the fewest first-inning runs in the A.L. and, after introducing the opener, ranked third in the majors with a 3.50 E.R.A., reducing the 4.43 it had to that point by nearly a run. “What they did last year was brilliant, and the results were pretty amazing,” Rothschild said. “You have to have the arms to do that.” He added, “We have the arms, too.” The idea is that having an elite reliever start the game helps mitigate damage in the first inning while reducing the long man’s exposure in the sixth — traditionally, the two highest-scoring innings across each season. That has changed somewhat this season, in part because of the opener’s influence. The first inning traditionally provides that offensive bounty because a manager can stack his best hitters at the top of the batting order, while some starting pitchers need time to settle. More runs were scored, on average in first innings than any other inning in 41 of the last 45 seasons, dating to 1974, the start of Baseball Reference’s complete play-by-play data. Through a quarter of the 2019 season, first innings rank fourth for runs, trailing third, fourth and sixth innings. The sixth is usually the next highest-scoring inning, marking the convergence of a tiring starter or a long reliever with the heart of the opponent’s order batting for the third time. Rays Manager Kevin Cash publicly described the rationale behind the opener simply as “a way for us to win games.” But what was born out of necessity for the small-market club worked for and has been mimicked by nearly half the league, including the moneyed elite. The Tigers, the Rangers, the Pirates and the Yankees all deployed openers for the first time this week. “It’s probably something that every team is going to look at as a viable option,” Rothschild said. The success of the opener, the Rays pitching coach Kyle Snyder theorized, generated some awareness and “maybe changed how a lot of traditional starting pitchers approached the first inning.” Added Cash, “I know we’ve asked our pitchers, ‘Don’t conserve anything — just go out there and, when it’s time for you to come out, we’ll come get you out.’” No matter their methods, the Rays and the Yankees have been two of the stingiest in first innings, yielding the third and fourth fewest runs in the majors this season. Green threw a scoreless first on Sunday, shutting down a Tampa Bay lineup that has been baseball’s most productive in those innings this season. Kendrys Morales’s run-scoring single for the Yankees plated the only first-inning run of the series. The results, though, have varied greatly for Yankees starters. Masahiro Tanaka, Domingo German and C. C. Sabathia have collectively allowed just two first-inning runs in 25 starts this season. But J. A. Happ has allowed a combined seven runs in the first innings of his nine starts, and Paxton has given up six first-inning runs in seven starts. Both Happ and Paxton lent credence to the notion that starting pitchers need time. Happ said he had usually “gotten better as the game went on.” Paxton’s average fastball velocity rises by nearly two miles per hour over the course of a start, but he said that was “not on purpose.” Finding timing has not been an issue for Tampa Bay’s Ryan Stanek. Since May 19, 2018, the king of openers has started 41 times — a quarter of all Rays games in that span — allowing only 10 runs in those opening frames. That’s good for a 2.23 E.R.A. in first innings, half of his 4.48 in all other innings. Stanek, though, says his preparation remained essentially the same. “I feel like not as much changes as people think,” said Stanek, who on Sunday was wearing a custom T-shirt in Rays colors featuring a can opener and a soup tin bearing the label “Openers are humans too.”",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Blast 5 More Homers Against the Orioles,"BALTIMORE — Gleyber Torres hit two of the Yankees’ five home runs, and the team survived a shaky outing from C.C. Sabathia in a 7-5 victory over the Orioles on Wednesday night. Torres homered leading off the third and fifth innings to help the Yankees take a 7-2 lead. He has four multihomer games this season — all against Baltimore — and has gone deep against the Orioles 10 times in 11 games. Gary Sanchez hit his ninth homer against the Orioles this season, and D.J. LeMahieu and Thairo Estrada also connected. New York has 33 home runs against Baltimore, leads the series 9-2 and is 6-0 at Camden Yards. The Yankees will seek to complete a four-game sweep Wednesday afternoon and already are assured of their sixth straight series win. Baltimore has lost five in a row to sink to 15-34, the worst record in the majors. Sabathia (3-1) allowed five runs and six hits, including two home runs, in five innings. Although his earned-run average climbed from 2.97 to 3.48, the lefty earned his first win at Camden Yards in seven starts since June 2016. Aroldis Chapman worked the ninth for his 13th save in 14 chances. The Yankees took charge in the second inning when Estrada and LeMahieu hit two-run homers off Dan Straily (1-4), who gave up two more long balls before being pulled after four ineffective innings. Torres hit Gabriel Ynoa’s second pitch over the right field wall, the 104th home run yielded by Baltimore pitchers in 49 games. One night earlier, the Orioles broke the record held by the 2000 Kansas City Royals for quickest to allow 100 home runs (57 games).",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Continue to Pummel Orioles Pitching,"BALTIMORE — Clint Frazier homered twice and drove in a career-high five runs, Gary Sanchez contributed a three-run drive and the Yankees kept up their assault on Baltimore pitching in an 11-4 rout Tuesday night. Domingo German (9-1) won his sixth consecutive start and increased his major-league-leading victory total. The right-hander pitched only five innings and left with a 9-3 lead. David Hale worked the last four innings to earn his first save since 2010 at Class A. The Yankees are 8-2 against the Orioles this season, after outscoring them by 73-40 and going 5-0 at Camden Yards. Over all, then Yankees have won 10 straight at Camden Yards. The Orioles are a major league worst 6-17 at home. Five of Frazier’s eight home runs this season have come against Baltimore, and Sanchez and Gleyber Torres each have homered eight times against Baltimore pitching. Of the major league-high 100 home runs the Orioles have allowed, 28 have been hit by the Yankees. D.J. LeMahieu had three hits and Sánchez finished with four R.B.I.s for the Yankees, who have won seven of eight. Stevie Wilkerson hit a three-run homer for the Orioles, who have lost 10 and 12 and dropped to an A.L.-worst 15-33. Baltimore has allowed double-digits in runs in three straight games and four of six. Sanchez got it started, hitting his second three-run homer in as many nights before David Hess (1-6) got an out. In the third, Gio Urshela doubled in a run before Frazier homered, and New York went up 9-0 in the fifth on Frazier’s three-run blast. INSIDE PITCH There was a lot of news on injured Yankees: After a bout of dehydration Monday, Didi Gregorius (Tommy John surgery) was held out of Tuesday’s extended spring training game but was expected to play Wednesday. … Giancarlo Stanton (left shoulder) also sat on Tuesday after homering for Class A Tampa on Monday … Dellin Betances (right shoulder) threw 120 feet on flat ground Tuesday. … James Paxton (knee) will pitch a simulated game (three innings) on Friday and may be able to rejoin the rotation. … Masahiro Tanaka, forced from Saturday’s game after being hit in the leg with a comebacker, will start against the Orioles on Thursday. … Aaron Judge (left oblique) shagged fly balls and took swings without a ball on Tuesday and is “definitely feeling better,” Manager Aaron Boone said.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Give Padres a Rude Welcome in First Visit to New Stadium,"Yankees 5, Padres 2 Yankees fans jeered Manny Machado on Monday afternoon with the same intensity Clint Frazier, Brett Gardner and Gary Sanchez pounded the baseball. Machado was greeted with loud boos and chants of “Overrated!” in his first visit to New York since free agency. He was 1 for 4 with a leadoff double in the ninth inning during the Yankees’ 5-2 win over the San Diego Padres, the eighth win in nine games for the American League East leaders. “I get booed everywhere I go,” Machado said. “Great players get booed.” Machado struck out, popped out and hit into a double-play grounder in his first three at-bats. He would not judge whether the salutation was louder than elsewhere. “How can you compare?” he said in a sometimes terse postgame media session. “A boo’s a boo.” A four-time All-Star with division rival Baltimore before he was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers last summer, Machado was interested in playing for the Yankees after becoming a free agent last fall. He dined with Yankees officials in December in hopes of becoming their third baseman. The team did not bite, however, and Machado signed a $300 million, 10-year contract with the Padres in February. The Yankees’ third basemen have 30 runs batted in this year, four more than Machado. Manager Aaron Boone thought the reception was predictable. “More a tribute to what a good player Manny is,” he said. San Diego became the last opposing team to play at the new Yankee Stadium, which opened in 2009, and quickly gained firsthand knowledge of its homer-friendly dimensions. Matt Strahm (2-4) struck out a career-high 10 in six innings but wasted a 2-0 lead in the Yankees’ three-run second. Frazier cut the deficit to 2-1 with his 10th homer, over the left-field scoreboard. Gio Urshela walked and Gardner hit a 352-foot fly over the right-field fence, giving the Yankees a 3-2 lead and leading Strahm to slam his glove against a thigh in anger. Sanchez added his 16th homer off Craig Stammen in a two-run eighth, an opposite-field shot to right measured at 353 feet. “I think everybody kind of knows Yankee Stadium, how short right field is,” Machado said. “You definitely saw that today with Gary. That was what, 300 feet?” Short on starting pitching with Luis Severino, James Paxton and C.C. Sabathia on the injured list, the Yankees used Chad Green as an opener for the third time, and he struck out the side in a perfect first as Machado swung under a slider. “That’s overpowering, dominating Greeny when he’s at his best,” Boone said. “He set the tone.” David Hale (1-0) allowed run-scoring doubles by Josh Naylor and Austin Hedges in the second, then retired his last 10 batters for his first win since September 2015 with Colorado. “It’s felt like a while,” Hale said. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman followed with an inning each, combining for three-hit relief in a six-hitter. Chapman got his 15th save in 16 chances. “It’s borderline textbook, six, seven, eight, nine, what they’re going to,” Padres Manager Andy Green said. San Diego lost its second straight after a five-game winning streak. At 27 the oldest starter in a young rotation, Strahm entered with eight consecutive outings of allowing two runs or fewer. He gave up four hits and three walks. “I didn’t have my changeup, but I made the adjustment and finished strong,” Strahm said. Inside Pitch After going 2 for 7 with a home run in two games for Class A Tampa, shortstop Didi Gregorius is set to move to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday as he nears a return from Tommy John surgery. … James Paxton (left knee inflammation) was cleared to pitch and could start Wednesday or Thursday in his first appearance since May 3. … C.C. Sabathia (fluid drained from right knee) could start Sunday’s series finale against Boston. … Luis Severino (right rotator cuff inflammation, strained lat muscle) planned to throw off flat ground Tuesday for the first time since April 6. … The right-handed pitcher Dellin Betances (right shoulder impingement) threw off a mound for the first time since March 17, a 20-fastball bullpen session. An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the impact of Clint Frazier’s second-inning home run in the Yankees’ 5-2 victory against the San Diego Padres. It cut the Yankees’ deficit to 2-1; it did not tie the score.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Greet Padres Rookie With Two Homers Right Off the Bat,"Yankees 7, Padres 0 Chris Paddack ran to the Yankee Stadium mound on Wednesday, eager to start for the San Diego Padres. Already a rookie sensation, he was savoring the type of moment he had envisioned since childhood. The reality was a bit more jarring. D. J. LeMahieu and Luke Voit, batting 1-2 in the lineup, jolted Paddack with home runs in the first inning, and the Yankees cruised to a 7-0 victory. Gio Urshela also connected off Paddack, Gleyber Torres hit a late homer and Voit added his first major league triple as the Yankees won their eighth straight series. James Paxton pitched four hitless innings for the Yankees in his return from the injured list. San Diego’s first hit came in the sixth, when Wil Myers’s blooper bounced out of LeMahieu’s glove as he drifted out from second base. Paddack, 23, began the day with a sparkling 1.93 earned run average. But the Yankees quickly showed him why so many visiting pitchers detest Yankee Stadium — and he wasn’t even victimized by the short porch in right field. LeMahieu led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run on an 0-2 pitch, and Voit followed with an even longer drive to left. It was the 10th time in franchise history the Yankees had begun a game with back-to-back homers. The most recent time was July 7, when Brett Gardner and Aaron Judge connected in Toronto against J. A. Happ, who is now their teammate. Paddack slapped his right hand into his glove when he reached the dugout. The Yankees kept making noise, too, when Urshela hit a solo shot in the second. At that point, Paddack (4-3) had allowed three home runs on only 23 pitches. Scratched from his previous start because of a stiff neck, he was pulled after five innings trailing, 4-0. “I think the guys were excited coming in today, an opportunity to face this guy that’s obviously kind of taken the league by storm,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. Paddack said he felt fine and blamed himself for poor pitch selection and execution. “Beat myself today,” he said, adding, “I’ll learn from it.” Paxton, on the other hand, was in complete control. Out for nearly a month because of inflammation in his left knee, he showed no ill effects in his 66-pitch outing. He struck out seven and walked two. “It was really good, seeing him back out there and just pitching so well,” Boone said. “He picked up right where he left off.” This is Paxton’s first season with the Yankees, and he previously mentioned he was having a little trouble with the mound in the Bronx. Boone said groundskeepers were working on a “fairly subtle” change to the sticky clay on the landing slope when Paxton pitches, hoping to soften the surface to ease the twist and torque on the left-hander’s knee. Chad Green worked the fifth, Adam Ottavino gave up Myers’s hit, Jonathan Holder (4-2) went two innings and Nestor Cortes Jr. completed the four-hitter. Voit hit a sinking liner that got past the charging center fielder Manuel Margot in the seventh, and Torres homered one batter later off Adam Warren. Notes The Yankees hope the left-handed pitcher C. C. Sabathia (right knee inflammation) can come off the injured list to start Sunday against the Red Sox. … Catcher Gary Sanchez and outfielder Aaron Hicks got a regular day of rest. … J. A. Happ (4-3, 5.09) is expected to face Boston’s Chris Sale on Thursday night as the Yankees begin a four-game series at home. Happ is 8-4 against the Red Sox, and pitched into the seventh inning against them in mid-April.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Injury Update: Didi Gregorius Takes a Big Step in His Recovery,"TAMPA, Fla. — Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius played five innings of defense and went 2 for 4 with a walk on Monday at extended spring training in his first game action since Tommy John surgery on Oct. 17. “It was good,” Gregorius said. Playing against Detroit Tigers minor leaguers and in front of Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner, Gregorius singled twice and cleanly fielded three grounders but got an error for a bad throw to first base. Gregorius, who throws right handed, is coming back from surgery to a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. He appears on track to start a minor league injury rehabilitation assignment with the Class A Tampa Tarpons soon and to rejoin the Yankees in mid-to-late June. “He got a lot of at-bats, got a couple balls. He threw a ball away, so his arm was feeling a little too good, I guess,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said before his team faced the Orioles in Baltimore. “But he got through it. A hot day down there. A couple more days down there and then, hopefully, get transferred over to the Tarpons. But a big step, obviously, in the return for Didi.” Gregorius had an eventful first inning. He charged to field a one-hopper and then make an accurate throw to first to retire the second batter. After fouling a ball off his foot and breaking a bat on a pop foul, Gregorius drew a walk in the bottom half. He slid feet first into second base on a grounder, then slid headfirst into third on an infield single. Gregorius hit .268 with a career-high 27 homers and 86 runs batted in last season. He injured the elbow in October while making a throw from left field after a ball bounced off Fenway Park’s Green Monster during Game 2 of the Yankees’ American League division series against the Red Sox. Outfielder Giancarlo Stanton was scheduled to start an injury rehab assignment for Class A Tampa on Monday night. He has not played since March 31 because of a strained left biceps and then a strained left shoulder. Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, sidelined since April 3 by a strained left calf, took on-field batting practice Monday and continued taking grounders at shortstop and third base.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Open Doubleheader With Sixth Win in a Row,"Yankees 7, Royals 3 | First Game KANSAS CITY, Mo. — With 60 family members and friends in the stands at Kauffman Stadium, Luke Voit hit a 470-foot, go-ahead home run in the seventh inning that sent the Yankees past the Kansas City Royals, 7-3, Saturday afternoon in the first game of a split doubleheader. Voit grew up near St. Louis, was drafted by the Royals out of high school, went to Missouri State and made his major league debut with the Cardinals. “To hit the farthest home run I’ve probably ever hit, in front of them, is pretty surreal,” Voit said. The two-run drive helped the Yankees win their sixth in a row. J.A. Happ (4-3) threw six strong innings, striking out 10. He allowed only a single hit until a familiar problem showed up in the sixth when Whit Merrifield hit a game-tying, three-run homer. It was the 14th homer Happ has allowed, tied for second most in the majors. But unlike past home runs, Happ threw a good pitch, and Merrifield simply put a good swing on the ball. “You tip your cap,” Happ said. “He hit a ball at his shoulders.” But Yankees Manager Aaron Boone would not let one swing take away from Happ’s effort. “It was a dominating effort,” he said. “He had swings and misses all day on the fastball. I thought he was just locked in from a focus standpoint, getting the ball and executing pitches all day long.” Voit quickly restored the Yankees’ lead when he connected off Scott Barlow (1-1). Voit also singled and scored in the first inning, from first base on Clint Frazier’s two-run double. “Everybody calls us the Baby Bombers, so I feel like someone will hit a home run or get a big hit,” Voit said. Thairo Estrada added some insurance in the eighth inning with a double into the right-field corner that scored Brett Gardner and Frazier. Gardner had three hits and scored twice. Adam Ottavino and Luis Cessa combined to throw three scoreless innings in relief of Happ. After Billy Hamilton reached on an infield single and Nicky Lopez singled, Merrifield connected for his seventh home run of the season. Merrifield did not hit his seventh homer last year until Aug. 5. “Whit’s put himself in a position to be a run producer,” Royals Manager Ned Yost said. Barlow had his second straight shaky outing for the Royals. His earned run average sat at 2.01 after a scoreless outing against the Los Angeles Angels last Sunday, but he was tagged for four runs in one and two-thirds innings on Wednesday in St. Louis and gave up four more runs Saturday in one and a third innings. “We gave up six runs on three hanging sliders today, and Barlow threw two of them,” Yost said. Jakob Junis threw six innings, giving up six hits, three runs and striking out seven, giving up little else after the two-run first. Lopez had a couple of hits in his first game as the Royals’ leadoff hitter, and Adalberto Mondesi stole his major-league-best 18th base.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Say Miguel Andujar Will Have Season-Ending Surgery,"Yankees third baseman Miguel Andujar, the runner-up in voting for the American League Rookie of the Year Award last season, has decided to have season-ending surgery, after nearly six weeks of trying to rehabilitate and then to play through a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder. Chris Ahmad, the Yankees’ head physician, will perform the surgery on Andujar, 24, on Monday at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the team announced Wednesday night. “Miguel tried to give as much to the team as he could but realized that he just wasn’t physically able to deal with the pain and still be as productive as we all know he can be,” Andujar’s agent, Ulises Cabrera, said in a text message after the team’s announcement. In a Yankees season defined by injuries — and by a 26-16 record in spite of them — Andujar became their first player to be shut down completely. Seventeen Yankees have hit the injured list in the first quarter of the season, and a major-league-leading 13 are currently there. “Miggy is beloved in that room and obviously really important to us between the lines and just who he is,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. “Hopefully this is a really good step for him in starting the healing process, so look forward to him getting it done and on his way back and making a full recovery.” Andujar, who hit .297 with 27 home runs and 92 runs batted in last season, originally hurt his right shoulder diving back to third base on a pickoff attempt on March 31. After a magnetic resonance imaging examination, the Yankees said that the tear was small and that Andujar’s shoulder still appeared to have substantial strength. He received a couple of medical opinions in which surgery was not suggested, Boone said earlier this week. The injury interfered mostly with Andujar’s throwing, not his hitting, and the Yankees put him through a stretching and strengthening routine, plus a gradual throwing program, before he returned from the injured list on May 4. Andujar played in nine games after he came back, mostly as the designated hitter, while Gio Urshela, a sure-handed fielder, took over at third base. But Andujar’s performance at the plate caused concern. Usually a stout hitter, he was 3 for 34 with no runs batted in after his return. He struck out nine times and was making weaker contact than usual. He batted .128 over all in 12 games this season. On Monday the Yankees decided to put Andujar back on the I.L. and to reconsider the options. Andujar recently had another M.R.I. exam, and the results were nearly identical to the previous one, Boone said Tuesday. Andujar was then given a few days to discuss the next move with his family and confidantes. He told the team on Wednesday that he would have the operation. “It’s sad,” Urshela said, adding later, “I’ll pray for him to get a quick recovery and get back soon.” Cabrera commended the Yankees’ treatment of Andujar throughout the process. He said that both doctors involved in the case — Ahmad and David Altchek, who provided a second opinion — were confident that Andujar could return to his previous form. After struggling in the field last season — only three major league third basemen made more errors than his 15 — Andujar spent the off-season and spring training working on his fielding and throwing, which he often preferred to do from a sidearm angle rather than the traditional overhand method. In his absence, Urshela has thrived, and over the weekend, the Yankees claimed infielder Breyvic Valera, who has played in parts of two major league seasons, off waivers from the San Francisco Giants. Valera was sent to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he and Tyler Wade can serve as infield insurance. On Tuesday night, the Yankees traded for Kendrys Morales, who Boone said was expected to get quite a few at-bats as the designated hitter. Morales, 35, was recently designated for assignment by the Oakland Athletics after hitting .204 with a .569 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. He went 1 for 2 with two walks in his Yankees’ debut, in the nightcap of their doubleheader sweep against the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday. But advanced metrics suggest that Morales was hitting the ball harder than his statistics showed. Last season with the Toronto Blue Jays, Morales hit .249 with 21 home runs and a .769 O.P.S. Morales, a switch hitter, has played in parts of 13 major league seasons, most with the Los Angeles Angels, and is a career .267 hitter with 212 home runs. In reality, the Yankees need only to buy about another month of time before shortstop Didi Gregorius returns. When Gregorius had Tommy John surgery last fall, his target return date was some point during the summer. He is on pace to return closer to the early side of that projection. Whenever Gregorius is back, Gleyber Torres can return to second base. D. J. LeMahieu can float around the infield, as he was expected to do before the season, or handle third base, with Urshela serving as a backup.",The New York Times
2019,"Yankees Show Off Their Depth, Beating the Orioles Once Again","Yankees 6, Orioles 5 BALTIMORE — Aaron Boone used all the self-discipline he could muster in making out the lineup on Thursday at Camden Yards, where the Yankees were on the doorstep of a four-game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles. It would have been easy to pencil in the club’s hottest hitters — Gleyber Torres and Gary Sanchez — and further demoralize the American League East. No one would have faulted Boone for going to the whip, even during this stretch of 17 consecutive games without a day off. His Yankees, after all, are baseball’s hottest team and continue to put distance between themselves and the Tampa Bay Rays. What manager dares to pull the plug on a hot streak? But Boone, taking the long view, opted for prudence. He kept both Torres and Sanchez out of the starting lineup — and still won. The 6-5 victory over Baltimore was the Yankees’ ninth in 10 games and improved their record to 24-7 since April 19, the best in the majors. When Boone says, “We’re playing really well,” he’s sending a chilling message to the rest of the American League: The Yankees are rolling with a cast like that of “The Expendables.” Think of it: Without Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton or Didi Gregorius, and with Torres and Sanchez saved until the ninth inning as pinch-hitters, the Yankees used the series finale as an advertisement for their depth. They erased an early 1-0 deficit on Clint Frazier’s solo homer in the fifth inning, took the lead on Gio Urshela’s two-run single in the sixth and made it 4-1 on Austin Romine’s run-scoring single in the seventh. [Keeping Score: Beating up the Orioles is a bit of a tradition for young Yankees hitters.] Luke Voit’s solo homer gave the Yankees what felt like a safe cushion in the eighth, but that was before the Orioles tied the game with a four-run rally in the bottom half of the inning, a rally that included Renato Nunez’s three-run home run off Tommy Kahnle. That was when Boone decided to unleash the bats he had held in reserve — Torres and Sanchez, both of whom had been on a ferocious tear. Torres’s two home runs on Wednesday represented his fourth multi-homer game of the season and extended his hitting streak to 11 games, during which he had batted .405. Sanchez? He had homered in his last three games before Thursday and, since April 7, had gone deep in five straight games against Orioles pitching. Despite the offensive momentum, Boone said both players would benefit from a day off. “This is about keeping him off his legs,” Boone said, speaking specifically of Torres. Not that Torres necessarily agreed. “I feel good, I feel healthy — I was ready,” he said, without rancor. Instead, his only responsibility was to stay sharp over the next several hours, which meant stretching in the clubhouse between innings, taking sets of practice swings and then returning to the dugout to catch up on the action before starting the cycle all over again. Staying ready proved wise once the ninth inning rolled around. Torres, batting for Thairo Estrada, drew a leadoff walk. Sanchez, batting for Romine, lifted a single to right, and the Yankees were ready to break the Orioles’ hearts one more time. When Aaron Hicks drew a bases-loaded walk off Mychal Givens, it not only scored Torres with the decisive run but sent the Orioles to their 10th loss in 12 games against the Yankees this season. Of course there are other challenges ahead of the Yankees; not every team is as undermanned as Baltimore. The Red Sox will be in town next weekend for a better measure of the balance of power in the East. But there are still signs of vast improvement in this year’s Yankees compared to the 2018 edition. Their strikeouts, for instance, are down drastically. The Yankees whiffed at the third-highest rate in the American League in 2018. This year they rank 11th. Although some argue that strikeouts are merely outs and nothing more, Boone disagreed. “Contact is important; it matters,” he said. “It’s something we talked about in spring training.” Marcus Thames, the Yankees’ hitting coach, said that philosophy — patience and discipline — had become a near obsession that the team’s hitters were buying into. “We talk about controlling the strike zone over and over in the dugout,” he said. “We talked about it in the spring and now in every meeting, before every series. We keep stressing how important it is to get your pitch. We never stop having that conversation.” The second half of the current makeover is more mental than physical: not relying nearly as much on Judge and Stanton. Or, more accurately, not feeling weaponless in their absence. The Yankees played .500 ball for most of the two months during which Judge was on the injured list in 2018. This year, they have actually flourished without him. “The difference is the mind-set,” said Judge, who is recovering from a severe oblique strain. “No one in here has panicked. Guys are seeing the injuries as a chance to step up, not a setback. I’ve been saying it all along: This is a special group. I feel that way more than ever.” INSIDE PITCH C. C. Sabathia was placed on the 10-day injured with inflammation in his right knee. Aaron Boone hopes treatment and rest will solve the issue and cost the pitcher just one start.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Top the Mariners as C.C. Sabathia Bests Felix Hernandez,"Yankees 7, Mariners 3 The Yankees pounced on Felix Hernandez, building a big cushion for C.C. Sabathia in a showdown of acclaimed veteran pitchers, and defeated the Seattle Mariners, 7-3, on Monday. Luke Voit, Brett Gardner and Thairo Estrada homered off Hernandez, giving Sabathia a 6-0 lead after two innings, and the Yankees held on for their 12th win in 16 games. Hernandez (1-3) settled down and lasted five innings, allowing seven runs. Hernandez had allowed just two homers in 12 career starts in the Bronx. He allowed three in seven batters Monday. “One of those nights when I didn’t have my best stuff,” Hernandez said. Domingo Santana and Dee Gordon homered off Sabathia (2-1), but he limited Seattle to three runs over five innings and struck out five in his first start since becoming the 17th major leaguer with 3,000 strikeouts in a career. Sabathia and Hernandez entered with a combined 5,498 strikeouts, the most between opposing starters since San Francisco’s Randy Johnson (4,867) faced Houston’s Roy Oswalt (1,418) in 2009. Sabathia struck out Mitch Haniger on three pitches to start the game and cruised the first time through the order. He tired in the fifth, loading the bases with a four-pitch walk to Santana with two outs before breaking Jay Bruce’s bat on a groundout to first. Hernandez had been sharper this season than during a dismal 2018, relying more on his curveball and doing a better job throwing strikes. That all fell apart quickly in the Bronx. Voit hit a two-run shot in the first, and Gardner homered leading off the second. Gardner also tripled and scored in the third. Estrada went the other way to right-center in the second for his first major league homer, then got the customary silent treatment in his dugout after rounding the bases. “You see the way we didn’t acknowledge him,” Sabathia said with a smile. “That always tells you that we care a lot about a guy.” Hernandez and Estrada both grew up in Valencia, Venezuela. “I did watch a lot of his games as a kid,” the 23-year-old Estrada said through an interpreter. “It’s kind of like a dream to face him and be able to connect.” Seattle loaded the bases with one out in the sixth against Jonathan Holder but couldn’t push any runs across. Adam Ottavino relieved and got a flyout from Haniger, and Estrada made a stellar play at short to charge Tim Beckham’s slow grounder for the final out. Santana hit a two-run homer in the fourth and Gordon lined a solo shot in the fifth. Gordon had three hits, but the Mariners have dropped seven of eight. New York hasn’t lost a season series against Seattle since 2003, going 12-0-4. Third baseman Gio Urshela, still in the lineup despite Miguel Andujar’s return from the injured list on Saturday, helped Sabathia with a couple of slick defensive plays. He made a stellar over-the-shoulder catch on Omar Narvaez’s flair in shallow left field in the third, then barehanded a chopper and threw smoothly to nab Beckham at first leading off the fourth. “That’s my game now, is trying to get soft contact,” Sabathia said. “And these guys are making great plays behind me.” Clint Frazier (sprained ankle) returned from the Yankees’ injured list and started in right field. He went 0 for 4.",The New York Times
2019,"Years Ago, My Sister Vanished. I See Her Whenever I Want.","Modern Love College Essay Contest The winner of this year’s Modern Love college essay contest explores the comforts and limits of online connection. “Don’t worry,” reads the cover photo of my sister’s Facebook page. “Everything is going to be amazing.” The words, in neon blue, green and red, glow from the screen as a kind of preternatural promise, a message from beyond. When I’m feeling stressed, I click on her profile, gaze at that image and take a deep breath. People leave notes, messages and pictures on her page. They say, “I miss you,” “I love you” and “I’m thinking about you.” They can’t leave flowers, but they do leave animated hearts. Sometimes they even travel through time by responding to a comment of hers from years before, and a certain magic is created — the conversation extending across a bridge of years, transcending her absence. The page facilitates a continuation, an afterlife. On Facebook, my sister’s words are preserved, frozen like a photograph. And her photographs remain, too, marking the stages of her young life. You can view them chronologically, scrolling to see a giggling girl in a pink Patagonia fleece become an 18-year-old model with a disposable camera and a goofy smile. You can watch her tan legs grow long, her hair become blonder and curled, her freckles scatter into constellations across her nose. You can see the seed of rebellion sprouting into an idea, her green eyes alive and wild. Every so often I click on the videos tab and watch as she and a friend drive through a tollgate with incorrect change. I listen (again and again) as my sister laughs. The video is grainy and absurd, and it’s difficult to distinguish faces, but her laugh is distinct, ringing out my favorite sound, throaty and extravagant. I used to call my sister’s phone when she first disappeared. I knew she wouldn’t answer — the signal had vanished the moment she had — but the voice mail was intact. When I needed to hear her voice, I would dial her number and she would tell me to leave a message. Occasionally, I did. I would tell her about my day or ask where she was. Other times I would cry, my silence following the beep. I used to text her number too. Technology allowed me to continue that casual correspondence like a widower might speak to a gravestone. I kept her up with the Kardashians, told her what colleges I had applied to, related gossip from our high school and the details of our parents’ separation. I told her crazy things, ridiculous things, things you only tell your older sister. The messages were automatic, reflexive, a mode of self comfort. Until one night, while out with friends at an Irish pub in Boston, I received a reply. At that point, it had been two years since the frigid January night when she took a taxi to the foot of Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Two years since my parents sat with detectives, viewing security camera photos that showed her walking toward the bridge’s high point in her red North Face jacket but not continuing. Two years since the searches for any trace of her came up empty. My family never officially proclaimed her deceased, but the reality settled in our stomachs like the dust that fell upon her untouched bedroom. When my iPhone buzzed at the bar in Boston and her name appeared on the black screen, I was so startled that I dropped it, my hands instantly slick and my heart racing. I was a freshman in college then and hadn’t told my new friends about my sister. It was easier to say I was an only child than to reveal the complicated truth. At the pub that night, a band was playing my sister’s favorite song, so I had texted: “I miss you.” That’s when her name appeared, with the message: “Who is this?” I rushed to the bathroom and made it into a stall, where I collapsed onto a toilet seat, thinking, “She’s alive. She’s alive.” Shaking, I pressed the call button. “Hello?” a voice said. It was a female voice but deeper than my sister’s, older. The woman explained that she had been given the number with her new cell plan. My roommates found me sobbing in the stall, mourning a new kind of loss. They guided me out past a well-meaning stranger at the sink who said, “Whoever he is, he’s not worth the tears. Trust me.” I wanted to say, “He is a she, and, trust me, she’s worth it.” I told my friends the truth that night, though it’s a truth I have struggled to face myself. After all, if I could still see her, hear her and text her, was she really gone? If Facebook reminded me annually of her birthday and calculated the passing years into her current age, then her death wasn’t a period or an end but more of an ellipsis, and I could still imagine the “…” of a chat bubble popping up at any moment. When someone you love disappears, there’s no finality of an autopsy report or the closure of a funeral. All you have is a lack of presence. You can piece together the mystery like in the Nancy Drew books you used to devour, but there’s no memorial service to confirm the truth. And that’s the problem: The promise of possibility, however faint, is harsher than any certainty. It has now been five years since her disappearance, and I still fantasize about an alternate outcome. That senseless hope is hard to smother, the off-chance that someday I may see her face in a crowd, as familiar as my own reflection. I’ll run toward her and save her this time. I have this dream a lot, intruding on other dreams, bullying them, demanding to be heard. Several years ago, my mother suggested we delete my sister’s Facebook account, wondering if it was inappropriate, the way her online life is paused with her random thoughts and photos on public display. Ultimately, we decided not to. It brings me too much comfort. As the years pass — I am now the age she was when she disappeared — I have come to know her better from the quotes she posted in her bio, the songs she queued in her iPod, the comments she left on her friends’ photos. It’s like getting to know someone through glimpses in a window, but it’s better than nothing. And yet, I understand my mother’s view. There’s something indecent about holding on to social media. It’s so alive, so casual, so improper. There are screenshots of FaceTime conversations, selfies, profane jokes, a picture of her asleep with a friend’s Chihuahua. Recently I read about the development of chatbots that can imitate human speech patterns. The technology is being considered as a way to facilitate bereavement, allowing us to communicate with loved ones through text messages. Using personal data and old messages, the bots can respond like your father, grandmother or sister. They can use your loved ones’ favorite phrases and dialectic habits. They can say, “I miss you, too.” With such sophisticated technology, the question is no longer what’s possible but what’s morally permissible. In the gray area between preservation and personality theft, there is a danger of too much holding on and not enough letting go. Memorials never feel like enough to the grief-stricken — never big enough or grand enough to commemorate the people we lose. Technology may get us closer, replicating faces and voices with alarming accuracy, but it will inevitably fall short. These days, there are fewer friends posting on my sister’s page, not as many hearts. As Instagram surges and Facebook recedes, I wonder how long her page will remain active. It’s sad to think that interest in my sister may depend on the relative popularity of a social media platform. For now, the photos keep her memory vivid, and I like the solidarity of knowing when others think of her and how they express that love. With absence comes forgetting, and Facebook helps me remember what I cannot bear to lose. On her page, her essence remains. The way she extended her words with too many vowels, “I miss you” becoming “I miiiiiiis youuuu!!!” The bright colors of her crochet top. The fuchsia she painted her nails one summer. A picture of us on Cape Cod, my gangly knees resting on her tan shoulders at sunset. I can see the scar on her lower lip from when she fell out of her bedroom window, sneaking out to a high school party. I can see her nose scrunched up as she readies herself to tell a joke. Facebook cannot mimic my sister’s flowery handwriting, remind me how she smelled when wearing her favorite perfume or hug me the way she used to. But it can preserve the post she left on my wall six years ago that reads, “I love you.” Sometimes, that’s enough. Kyleigh Leddy is a senior at Boston College.

2019,"Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Attack Saudi Oil Facilities, Escalating Tensions in Gulf","BEIRUT, Lebanon — Yemen’s Houthi rebels carried out multiple drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities on Tuesday, a day after Saudi Arabia said two of its oil tankers had been damaged in an act of sabotage, ratcheting up tensions in the region. A Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdul Salam, claimed responsibility for the drone strikes on Twitter, saying that they were a response to Saudi “aggression” and “genocide” in Yemen. Although the Houthis are backed by Iran, it was unclear whether the attacks were related to increasing tensions between Iran and the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf. A total of four oil tankers were damaged off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on Sunday in what the Emirati government called acts of sabotage. Though little hard information has emerged about the attacks, American and Gulf suspicions have centered on Iran, in an area already jittery about the prospect of a violent clash with the republic. The Trump administration has warned of planned aggression by Iran or its proxies, though it has not elaborated on that contention, and it has deployed military forces to the region. But both sides said Tuesday that they were not looking for a war, even as the threats and counterthreats continued. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in comments carried on state television that “no war is going to happen,” The Associated Press reported. “Neither we, nor they are seeking war,” he said. “They know that it is not to their benefit.” And in a visit to Russia on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, “We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran.” But the Trump administration has not ruled out further increasing the American military presence in the region. Responding to a New York Times report that Pentagon officials were drawing up plans to deploy as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East, Mr. Trump called it “fake news” and said that “we have not planned for that.” “Hopefully we’re not going to have to plan for that,” he added. “And if we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.” The four ships were damaged on Sunday in coastal waters near the Strait of Hormuz, the vital waterway to the Persian Gulf, through which much of the world’s oil flows. The Saudi government said two of the ships were Saudi tankers, identified by industry officials as Al Marzoqah and the Amjad, and a Norwegian shipping company said another was one of its tankers, the Andrea Victory. The fourth was an Emirati tanker. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they were investigating the attacks. A senior Defense Department official said Tuesday that based on a “holistic assessment,” the military believes that “Iran is likely” behind the tanker attacks. However American officials said there was no definitive evidence linking Iran or its proxies to the attacks. Iran suggested Tuesday that the tanker attacks were a provocation intended to escalate tensions. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran said that it had “previously predicted that such actions would occur to create tensions in the region,” according to IRNA, a state news agency. Speaking in New Delhi, he also warned of the danger posed by “extremist individuals in the U.S. government.” Mr. Zarif and other Iranian officials have sought to portray President Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, as a warmonger eager to push the two countries into conflict. Mr. Pompeo said Tuesday that the United States was still trying to get more information about the attacks. “We’re working diligently to get answers to what caused those ships to have the problems that they have today,” he said at a news conference in Sochi, Russia. The attack on the Saudi oil facilities added a new element to the tensions. A Houthi-run television station, Al Masirah, reported that seven drones had “targeted vital Saudi facilities.” The Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said the attacks on two pumping stations had caused “limited damage.” He said the government was shutting down a pipeline while it assessed the damage and made repairs. “The Kingdom condemns this cowardly attack,” Mr. Falih said in a statement. “And this recent terrorist and sabotage act in the Arabian Gulf against vital installations not only targets the kingdom, but also targets the safety of the world’s energy supply and the global economy.” Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are fighting the Houthis in Yemen to restore the government that the Houthis ousted from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The war in Yemen is viewed as another front in the regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia considers the Houthis an Iranian proxy. The Houthis receive support from Iran, but deny that they are an Iranian proxy. The affected pipeline runs from the oil production areas in the eastern part of the country to the Red Sea in the West, where the Saudis maintain export facilities. Those facilities help ensure they can continue to export oil if they have difficulties doing so from the Persian Gulf. Sadad I. Al-Husseni, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, said the strikes did not pose a serious risk to the Saudi infrastructure. “The facilities in the kingdom were designed at a time when there were wars going on in the Gulf,” he said. “So everything was redesigned and upgraded in order to take advantage or make allowances for the security aspects.”",The New York Times
2019,Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Say They’re Withdrawing From Vital Red Sea Port,"CAIRO — Houthi rebels in Yemen said they had started to withdraw from three strategic Red Sea ports on Saturday, offering a tentative boost to faltering United Nations-led efforts to start talks on ending the four-year war in the country. Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the rebels’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said they had started to pull out of Hudaydah, the main conduit for humanitarian aid into Yemen, and two smaller nearby ports, Salif and Ras Isa. The extent of the withdrawal was unclear. United Nations officials posted to Yemen had not offered any confirmation by Saturday afternoon. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, whose troops are stationed on the southern and eastern edge of Hudaydah, offered no comment. The United Nations envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, described the process as a “fragile vessel.” Many worry that its failure could plunge Yemen into a new, even more destabilizing, round of fighting. The Houthi withdrawal revives a deal signed amid considerable fanfare in December, when both sides agreed to withdraw from Hudaydah to help avert a catastrophic famine in Yemen. An estimated 80 percent of Yemenis, or 24 million people, require relief aid, according to the United Nations. But implementation of the deal, which was supposed to start in January, has been plagued by distrust and delays. Houthi officials faced accusations of breaking their promises. At times the agreement appeared to veer toward collapse. Intensive diplomacy led by Mr. Griffiths, shuttling between Arab capitals, helped rescue the deal this past week. Even so, his optimism was tempered with caution. “We have to keep at this,” Mr. Griffiths told the BBC on Saturday. “We have to make it work. There really frankly is no choice for the people of Yemen.” Peace efforts in Yemen have seen several false dawns since the war began in earnest in 2015 when Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia deployed troops to oust the Iran-allied Houthi rebels who had seized the capital, Sana. Since the Hudaydah deal was signed in Sweden in December, fighting has surged in other parts of Yemen. On Saturday, officials from the internationally recognized government of Yemen, which is backed by the Saudis, sent mixed signals about the withdrawal. One senior Yemeni official welcomed the Houthi move as “the first step of the first stage.” But the country’s information minister, Moammar al-Eryani, went on Twitter to call it “misleading” and unacceptable if it failed to provide joint verification. The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, sounded an optimistic note about the withdrawal on Saturday. In two Twitter posts he noted “encouraging signs” from Hudaydah and said that “we appear to be approaching implementation of the mutual redeployment of forces — a key step to ending this brutal war.” Lt. Gen. Michael Lollesgaard, who is leading the United Nations mission in Hudaydah, on Friday welcomed the Houthi promise to withdraw but said it must be followed by “committed, transparent and sustained actions.” If the withdrawal succeeds, he said that the United Nations will take a leading role in the management of the three Red Sea ports, and will strengthen its efforts to prevent weapons smuggling by sea.",The New York Times
2019,"Yes, African-Americans Drink Bourbon. You’d Never Know It From the Marketing.","Groups like the Black Bourbon Society have formed to share an appreciation of the whiskey, and distillers are finally starting to pay attention. Who is the typical bourbon drinker? Judging by the marketing for most whiskeys, a safe guess would be a white man, of middle age, and Southern by birth or at least aspiration. It could be a blond woman in full Kentucky Derby pastels, holding a mint julep. Many people would probably not picture someone like Samara Rivers, because African-Americans like her are almost completely absent from bourbon marketing. That’s why Ms. Rivers founded the Black Bourbon Society, a national organization for African-American whiskey fans that since its creation two years ago has grown to more than 4,700 members. In late April, Ms. Rivers led 35 of them on a weekend tour through Kentucky, beginning with private tastings at distilleries like Woodford Reserve and Buffalo Trace and ending with a Sunday brunch in Louisville, where they honored the history of black horse jockeys. “There’s this big hole in the market,” said Ms. Rivers, 38. “What do black consumers look like? We’re teaching brands how to engage with fans like us.” While white people make up about three-quarters of all bourbon consumers in the United States, according to a survey by the media company Gravity, the details are more complicated. African-Americans are the most likely demographic group to prefer spirits like whiskey or Cognac over beer or wine, according to Nielsen research. But while they constitute 13 percent of the total population, they are just 9 percent of bourbon drinkers. That represents a significant gap in the market, one that may grow more pronounced as the number of nonwhite consumers — what marketers call the multicultural demographic — continues to expand with America’s rapidly diversifying population. These realities hold for other types of spirits, like Scotch and vodka. But bourbon sales are on a decade-long tear, growing at 6 percent or more a year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. That has American whiskey companies scrambling to create or expand their marketing efforts to people of color, and rethinking how they approach black consumers in particular. “The growth is all coming from multicultural,” said Ryan Robertson, the head of multicultural marketing for Diageo, the British spirits company that produces bourbon brands like Bulleit and I.W. Harper. “For our brands to be sustained in the future, we have to absolutely start with a multicultural lens.” For many black bourbon drinkers, the change isn’t coming fast enough. They say that most brands, when they do reach out, still pigeonhole African-American consumers with outdated playbooks aimed at the “urban demographic”— industry-speak for lower-income, younger black consumers who supposedly gravitate toward sweeter spirits like Cognac and flavored whiskey. “Don’t promote to me with honey flavors or some hip-hop star,” said Jamar Mack, 36, an African-American bourbon fan in Louisville. “My race is not my palate.” Like Ms. Rivers, a few years ago Mr. Mack found himself falling in love with premium bourbons like Woodford Reserve, but he was frustrated by the lack of attention paid to minorities at the events sponsored by his favorite brands. In 2017 he founded Kentucky’s Original Black Bourbon Enthusiasts, a Louisville-based club that has since added several thousand members, some as far away as West Virginia, who attend private tastings, distillery tours and charity events around central Kentucky. “We did a survey of our members, and 98 percent of them are college graduates, and 70 percent make over $150,000 a year,” Mr. Mack said. His events regularly attract 100 members or more, he added, but until recently, he had trouble getting distillers to send ambassadors to lead tastings, a common practice in the industry. Such differential treatment is something Kurt Maitland, the founder of the Manhattan Whisky Club and the author of “Drink: The Ultimate Cocktail Book,” knows all too well. Mr. Maitland, who is black, said he had no problem getting distillers to send a representative to his monthly events in Midtown Manhattan. But in the Bronx, where he lives near Yankee Stadium, premium bourbon is almost nowhere to be found, in bars, stores or advertising. “There are groups of people in my neighborhood who I know are interested in high-end whiskey,” said Mr. Maitland, 47. “But they aren’t exposed to it in their regular life.” He isn’t going to wait for the brands to catch up: Mr. Maitland plans to open a spinoff of his whiskey club in the Bronx later this year. Bourbon makers aren’t the only ones in the alcohol industry trying to attract nonwhite consumers. Some craft brewers and winemakers have made concerted efforts to diversify their workforces and their marketing appeal beyond their middle-class white base. But when it comes to race, the bourbon industry has a particularly fraught history. Up to the 1950s, brands were often marketed with explicitly racist imagery, depicting black men as minstrels, fools and servants. Some popular bourbons, like Rebel Yell — named for a Southern battle cry from the Civil War — even played on Confederate imagery to win over Southern whites. But as the civil rights movement raised the industry’s awareness of black middle-class consumers, whiskey makers began to reach out to African-American drinkers. They filled the pages of Ebony magazine with advertisements tailored to the magazine’s readers: One, from 1966, showed a stylish black couple touring the Old Taylor distillery; another, produced by Jim Beam in 1977, featured Ella Fitzgerald. With the precipitous decline in bourbon sales between the late 1970s and the early 2000s, though, marketing of American whiskey virtually disappeared. The few advertising dollars still available were spent on the industry’s core white-male audience — a group that, critics say, remains the focus today, even as the consumer base has grown and diversified. “These brands are not necessarily innovative in their marketing,” Mr. Maitland said. One of the few to take a different approach is Uncle Nearest, founded in 2016 by Fawn Weaver and named for Nearest Green, the former slave who became Jack Daniel’s first master distiller. Ms. Weaver, 42 and African-American, said that when she was starting her business, the most common advice she heard was to focus on white men ages 29 to 55 — advice she quickly rejected. But she is also wary of people who assume that just because she is black, and her whiskey celebrates a black distiller, she is making a product exclusively for black consumers. Instead, she wants her brand, and whiskeys generally, to eschew race-based marketing in favor of a broader approach. “As an African-American, I don’t want to be targeted, but I do want to be included,” she said. “For many brands, in their marketing you’ll see all white folks, and then a separate campaign that only appears in places like Atlanta or Washington, D.C.” Some of the established companies are starting to get the picture. In 2018 Brown-Forman, which owns Jack Daniel’s and Woodford Reserve, restructured its multicultural team; in the past it was siloed away from the brand-specific marketing efforts, but now it acts as an in-house consulting operation, helping the groups working on Jack Daniel’s and other products to improve their outreach to consumers of color. “Multicultural used to be thought of as a niche,” said Tracey Johnson, the company’s multicultural marketing manager. “Now we say, it’s everyone’s responsibility. Our goal is to have our message be relevant across cultures.” Diageo has likewise expanded its multicultural initiatives. It has hired more people of color for its marketing teams — including Mr. Robertson, the company’s head of multicultural marketing. Its I.W. Harper brand, which bills itself as a drink for refined hipsters (Diageo calls them “fashionable gents”), is one of the few bourbons to include mostly African-Americans in its ads and social-media postings. “They may skew African-American, but the brand is meant to be inclusive,” said Mr. Robertson of Diageo (though the women left out of the “fashionable gents” might disagree). Ms. Rivers, of the Black Bourbon Society, said that for all the industry’s missteps, she sees a genuine desire to get it right, if only because in a diversifying society, “it’s bad business not to be diverse in your marketing.” And she hopes that the success of grass-roots groups like hers will persuade bourbon brands to move beyond ill-fitting stereotypes about the urban demographic. “We’re here,” Ms. Rivers said, “and we bought products without any marketing. Now, imagine what you could do with some awareness.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

2019,"Yes, India’s Economy Is Growing, but Can You Trust the Data?","NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India won re-election last week with what seemed to be rousing support for his market-oriented economic policies — yet few in India can agree on just how much growth or unemployment occurred in his first term. The Indian government’s official data shows the economy expanding 7 to 8 percent a year, rivaling or exceeding China since he took office in 2014. But changes in India’s statistical processes, particularly tracking whether jobs were created or lost under Mr. Modi, have prompted allegations of political interference and questions about data quality. A new national employment survey was scheduled for release early last year and was to be used to reassess economic growth, but has been delayed repeatedly, prompting two senior government statisticians to resign in January. Some of its data was leaked to the Business Standard, an Indian newspaper, showing unemployment at 6.1 percent, more than double previous reports. Labor Ministry surveys from 2011 through 2016 had the jobless rate below 3 percent. The big question is: Whose data do you trust? Some economists, particularly in academia, are deeply suspicious of the government’s statistics. “They have politicized this whole data collection process,” said Jayati Ghosh, an economist at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. “Nobody believes the numbers anymore.” At the heart of the debate is a change in statistical methodology that actually has little to do with current politics. The change was approved by Mr. Modi’s immediate predecessor as prime minister, Manmohan Singh, with strong support from multilateral institutions including the United Nations and International Monetary Fund, which endorsed it as a modernization. For decades, India had been following a simple approach: The government counted the quantities of various goods and services being produced. It was a broad sample survey, and the government then used the estimated prices for these goods and services to calculate growth. Countries around the world, including the United States, once used versions of that approach, although industrialized countries mostly abandoned it over the last several decades. But growth statistics produced by this method are highly dependent on the price estimates. For example, if you are counting cars, you could miss the economic growth that occurs as manufacturers charge more for their cars when they add fancier engines or leather seats. The new method — which India has embraced — relies on financial data reported to the government. The financial results of 900,000 companies incorporated in India are assessed to gauge the country’s total economic activity. India is one of the first developing countries to adopt this method. But small businesses abound in India, and until the past couple of years they operated almost entirely on cash. This so-called informal economy, including agriculture, represents nearly half of India’s economic output. The new statistical method assumes that the informal economy will go up and down in parallel to the incorporated companies. Most of the time, that is a fair assumption, said Pronab Sen, a longtime civil servant who oversaw India’s economic statistics and the introduction of the new system before retiring in 2016. But small businesses were less able to cope with some big structural changes of the Modi years, he said. “Corporate India is doing very well,” Mr. Sen said in an interview at his home in southwestern New Delhi. “Noncorporate India, which accounts for about 45 percent of the economy, is not.” Mr. Modi abruptly recalled the country’s large-denomination currency bills in November 2016. It was a mostly unsuccessful effort to catch people skirting taxes. Large businesses could adapt by asking customers to use credit cards or bank wire transfers for easier transactions. Small businesses, reliant on cash, suffered months of severe disruption. Seven months later, in summer 2017, a single value-added tax was introduced, partly to better monitor taxable revenue. The new tax replaced a labyrinth of 17 state and national taxes, and considerably curtailed widespread bribery between businesses and tax collectors. Big businesses could afford to hire specialists to cope with the change and the government’s buggy software. Small businesses struggled, and are still struggling, to adjust. Government economic statistics have not measured the divergence between how small and large businesses were affected by the reforms. The Modi campaign ran partly on its efforts to free businesses from red tape, but it provided no data from the past two years on joblessness, a key indicator of the informal sector’s health. Disputes over India’s data prompted rancor, including complaints from 108 economists and social scientists who signed a letter in March that contended the Modi government was silencing bad news. “In fact, any statistics that cast an iota of doubt on the achievement of the government seem to get revised or suppressed on the basis of some questionable ideology,” the letter said. Mr. Modi’s economic policy commission has insisted that the unemployment survey data — which remains unpublished — needs further review. Amitabh Kant, the commission’s chief executive and one of Mr. Modi’s top appointees, said in an interview that “India is creating a lot of jobs, but India is not creating quality jobs.” News reports that unemployment may have doubled, as the Business Standard account indicated, have inflamed the debate. Some business allies of Mr. Modi have taken to questioning how unemployment is even recorded. “We are foolishly chasing the myth of jobs,” said Shailesh Haribhakti, a Mumbai accountant and financier who is on the boards of 16 companies. “The world has moved on from the previous direction of putting people to work from 9 to 5 and paying them a monthly salary.” Mr. Sen, the retired civil servant, said he believed that workers who were paid directly for individual jobs, like Uber drivers, were being properly counted. The most likely explanation for the reported leap in unemployment, he said, is that many small businesses are still recovering from the currency overhaul of two years ago. What is the true rate of economic growth now? Mr. Sen said he would not even hazard a guess.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | Yes, This Is What Gifts Are Now","Your mom is going to love that shark stem cell face cream. Ms. Heisey is a comedy writer. Hello, sister, fellow goddess, owner of similar luxury overalls. Thank you for entering my boutique. Did you think it was a coffee shop from the outside? Ha-ha! How silly. That bistro table is there just to display small rings for your fingers, even smaller rings for your toes, and some impossibly small metal hoops that look like rings, to hold and wonder about. The chairs? Simply ambient. Welcome. Looking for a Mother’s Day gift, are we? Beautiful. I’m certain we have a body oil, facial oil, or oil-adjacent serum that will make your mother feel like the queen she is. Don’t tell me anything about her, it’s simply not necessary. We have just the thing for her, because there are only five acceptable gifts now! Please select from candle, hanging plant, iPhone accessory, ostensibly feminist art item, or linen. I’m kidding! There’s so much more. Kind of. Why don’t we begin by taking a deep sniff of the air? After all, the shopping experience begins in the nostrils. Once the delicate combination of rose elixir and culturally appropriated herbs hits those olfactory receptors, it’s time to shop! We invite you into the store nose-first, then further invite you to give us $37 for a bundle of dried leaves tied together with what might honestly be floss. Now: trays. Your mom might have told you she doesn’t want anything, or that she’d rather just spend quality time with you, but she’s lying. She wants a small ceramic tray with the moon on it, to hold earrings, coins and other woman’s trinkets. She wants it to say “dream” in calligraphy. She needs it to be made by a “pagan artisan” whose company name promises witchcraft and then does not fulfill that promise in any way. Your mother labored for hours to bring you into the world; the least you can do is fulfill her every wish by giving her a small shell to place a necklace in! If dishes featuring “Scorpio-inspired” watercolors aren’t for you, first of all: Apologize to us. Then move along to our area of delicate glass bottles. What’s in there? Tinctures! Also essences, loosely defined “potions,” and of course, herbaceous toothpaste that does not work. This is an apothecary, after all! Sure, you’re not going to buy a special Japanese sponge for your own face, but isn’t it something your mother might possibly, theoretically want? They always say a good gift is something she’d never buy for herself, and your mom probably didn’t even know you could make a face cream out of shark stem cells. Not into the unguents? Then what do you want? Do I need to get out the dictionary here? “Gift shopping” (verb): when a 30-year-old female considers a plant held in pottery shaped like human breasts.

Your mother accepts them supportively, then gets intimidated and puts them in the closet. That is how it works. It’s like, you made the choice to come into this store, then walked right past our signature organic salad spoons and didn’t even touch the Ruth Bader Ginsburg-themed tea towels. I see what’s happening. You’re one of those people who just wants to buy a “normal present” that wasn’t “made by vegan farm animals.” Maybe you’d rather celebrate your mother with something functional, rather than with “some whimsical objects to place around her desk and nightstand and take pictures of, I guess,” is that right? We’d all like to go to a store that offers more than one size of one kind of T-shirt, but I’m just not sure you’re being realistic. I don’t know when it happened either, but this is what gifts are now, and you’re going to have to put on your big girl jumpsuit and deal with it. Pick up this book that’s just pictures of cabin doors. Hasn’t your mom ever been in a cabin? Perfect, you did it. Why not grab a key ring that says “night bae, dream festival” on it. What does that mean? Who cares. Wrap it in some reclaimed paper and you’ve got a present on your hands! Sure, your mom hasn’t touched weed since she smoked a joint in high school and had an “out of body experience” but maybe she’d like some CBD water that tastes like matcha.

2019,"Yes, the P.G.A. Championship Is Happening Now","The tournament that used to wrap up golf’s majors in August has moved to May. The players approve. Less sweat is better. FARMINGDALE, N.Y. — At last year’s P.G.A. Championship, Tiger Woods changed shirts midway through his rounds because he was perspiring so profusely. That doesn’t figure to be a problem on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park, where the 101st edition of the tournament commences on Thursday. The sweltering days last August in St. Louis, where the heat index reached triple digits, are a bygone memory. Woods, who grew up in Southern California and lives in Florida, wore a stocking hat and multiple layers as he practiced Tuesday in cold, damp conditions. “I’ve been doing a lot of practicing of late, not in sweaters,” Woods said, “so this is a little different.” The golf calendar, particularly the majors, tends to be as much of a certainty as Thanksgiving dinner at your grandparents’ house. But the PGA Tour wanted to move up its season-ending playoff series, which typically finished in late September, so it wasn’t competing against the N.F.L. or college football. Accommodating that shift meant holding the P.G.A. Championship three months earlier, making it the second major of the year instead of the final one. Since 1960, when Arnold Palmer ushered in the modern Grand Slam, the P.G.A. Championship had been the final major every year save for 1971, when it was in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and moved to February to avoid South Florida’s summer weather. The P.G.A. Championship has always been the most flexible of majors, switching from its match-play beginnings to stroke play and occupying dates in every month from May to December during its first century of existence. Even so, the decision to move the tournament required four years of deliberations to finalize and another two years to execute. “I was a pretty big fan of this date change,” Rory McIlroy, a two-time P.G.A. champion, said. The move, he noted, will make the tournament available to courses in the South or Southwest, whose hot, humid summers had rendered them geographically undesirable. “It gives the P.G.A. of America more of a variety of courses to go to, which I think is a good thing,” McIlroy said. The P.G.A. of America, which controls this championship, is a separate entity from the PGA Tour, the primary organizing body for professional men’s golf. The timing of the move turned out to be propitious. There is palpable excitement, and not just among hard-core golf fans, to see what Woods does as an encore to his victory last month in the Masters, his first major title in almost 11 years and his 15th overall. The last time the P.G.A. Championship took place in May, in 1949, the winner was Sam Snead, whose all-time PGA Tour record of 82 victories Woods will equal with his next win. Woods, 43, hasn’t played since the Masters. He bypassed the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., where he has won before, but not, he said, because of any physical infirmity. Woods, who has had four back operations since 2014, alluded on Tuesday to a letdown after his emotional Masters finish. “I wasn’t ready yet to start the grind of practicing and preparing and logging all those hours again,” he said, adding: “Coming here is a different story. I was able to log in the hours, put in the time and feel rested and ready.” Woods, a four-time P.G.A. champion, is scheduled to tee off at 8:24 a.m. Thursday with Brooks Koepka and Francesco Molinari. To contend, Woods will need to drive the ball as well as he did at Augusta National. The 7,500-yard Bethpage Black layout is a beast, featuring two 500-yard par-4s. The rough is thicker than a hockey playoff beard, and the ball doesn’t travel so far in chilly weather. Not that Max Homa, the winner of the Charlotte tournament, seemed to notice on Tuesday; he won the long-drive contest with a 318-yard attempt. “If you can’t find the fairway here, I think you’re really going to run into issues,” said Koepka, who held off Woods to win last year’s P.G.A. Championship at Bellerive Country Club and finished a stroke behind Woods at the Masters. In the 29-year-old Koepka, Woods might finally have found the genuine rival who eluded him in his prime. “I don’t see it as a rivalry,” Koepka said, “although it is fun to play against him, best player to ever play the game.” On Tuesday Woods was asked if Koepka, who is built like a home-run hitter, reminded him of his younger self. Woods laughed. “I was never that big,” he said, adding, “Brooksy has just got pure power and he’s an athlete.” In 2000, Woods won the British Open to become the fifth man to win all four of golf’s majors in his career. Jordan Spieth can become the sixth with a victory at Bethpage. Spieth, 25, has 11 PGA Tour titles, but none since the 2017 British Open. His best finish this season was a tie for 21st at the Masters (where his lowest finish in five previous appearances had been a tie for 11th). He has been driving short and crooked, which does not bode well on a course that favors those who hit long and straight. “I’ve shot some low rounds, but piecing together four has been difficult this season so far,” Spieth said, adding, “If I can continue to make the amount of birdies I’ve been making and then just limit the mistakes a little bit, then I should be right in it.”",The New York Times
2019,Yoenis Cespedes Fractures Ankle in ‘Violent’ Fall at His Ranch,"When Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen walked into the news conference room at Citi Field three hours before the Mets faced the Washington Nationals on Monday, he was expected to address Manager Mickey Callaway’s job status. After getting swept by the lowly Miami Marlins over the weekend, the Mets were on a five-game losing streak, six-and-a-half games out of first place, and rumors were swirling that Callaway might be fired shortly. Instead, Van Wagenen started with a bizarre injury update that only added to the sense of chaos surrounding the Mets. Yoenis Cespedes, the left fielder who has not played a game this season after having off-season surgery on both of his heels, had informed the team on Saturday night that he had fractured his right ankle in a “violent” fall on his ranch in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Van Wagenen declined to put a timetable on a possible return for Cespedes, who was already expected to miss at least the majority of this season, and said that he did not yet know whether Cespedes might miss time in 2020, as well. “Hard to predict what the future is,” Van Wagenen said. “We need to get more information from the doctors.” Van Wagenen, who left his job as a player agent to become the Mets’ G.M. last off-season, represented Cespedes in a contract negotiation after the 2016 season that netted the player a four year-contract extension worth $110 million. After learning of Cespedes’s fall late Saturday, Van Wagenen left the Mets’ series in Miami to see his former client and current employee. According to Van Wagenen, Cespedes told the team that he had fallen after stepping in a hole on his ranch, twisting his right ankle and sustaining multiple fractures. Van Wagenen noted that Cespedes had been performing a non-baseball activity when the accident occurred. When asked if Cespedes, who once rode a horse into the team’s parking lot during spring training, had fallen off a horse, Van Wagenen responded that Cespedes had said he was not riding a horse. “Our focus currently is to try to get him the best medical care and then hopefully get a better idea what this means for his future both in 2019 and beyond,” Van Wagenen said. Cespedes, 33, was to be evaluated by doctors at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan on Monday. Cespedes signed his extension after a season in which he played in 132 games and was an All-Star. But the Mets’ investment in him was viewed as a risky commitment for a 31-year-old player, and the front office’s worst fears have largely come true since. Various injuries have limited Cespedes to 81 games in 2017 and 38 games last year. Even before the ankle injury, Van Wagenen said on Monday, Cespedes had been far from returning from his heel operations. “We haven’t even thought about implications to a contract,” Van Wagenen said. “Our focus right now is on the player’s health and trying to get the right answers of what procedures need to be done, if any, and what the prognosis will be coming out of this.” Cespedes helped power the Mets to the World Series in 2015 after being acquired just before the trade deadline that season in a swap with the Detroit Tigers. That winter, he signed a three-year contract worth $75 million to stay in Queens. He exercised his opt-out clause the next winter after another strong season — a .280 average, 31 home runs and 86 R.B.I. But since then, he has had numerous injuries. In 2017, he missed time with hamstring and quadriceps ailments. Last year, he went on the disabled list on May 14 for a right hip flexor strain. He later suffered a setback while rehabilitating it in a minor league game, and the team announced that his season was over in July because of calcification and bone spurs in both heels. After Cespedes went down last season, the Mets were unable to string together wins and fell below .500 by midsummer before finishing 77-85. Callaway added Cespedes to a growing list of concerns Monday. After Van Wagenen was done talking, Callaway acknowledged that, like their absent outfielder, the Mets had also fallen into a hole. “We have to climb out of it,” he said, “and I believe we will.”",The New York Times
2019,Yoga’s Instagram Provocateur,"heart this Raised in bohemia at the Chelsea Hotel, Alex Auder now punctures the wellness world on Instagram. Can you blame her? You cannot swing a cat (pose) on Instagram without hitting photographs of yoga instructors with perfect figures twisted into perfect shapes, selling essential oils and greeting-card spirituality. Alex Auder is not one of them. Ms. Auder, 48, is something of a yoga auteur, sharing homemade videos that are more performance art than content. In them she satirizes, mocks and sometimes fillets the wellness industry, its relentless marketing and “the commodification of yoga,” as Ms. Auder calls it. She writes, stars in and films a regular series of videos in which she has painted a dollar sign on her forehead in eyeliner and plays a character hawking essential oils with names like “urine mist,” “feces” and “The One Per Scent.” She also plays a Wall Street dropout who has invested in wellness companies and thanks yoga instructors for continuing “to convince your fellow women to buy into me. I’m making more money than I did on Wall Street and you are still poor.” Then there is the series in which she plays the role of an exacting yoga instructor who berates her students, played by naked dolls whose bodies are covered with Sharpie-drawn dollar signs and the names of yoga clothing brands like Spiritual Gangster. In one popular video, Ms. Auder has herself wrapped in what appear to be Ikea rugs as she exits a car. “Being a healer who is sponsored by more than 500 brands is a lot of pressure,” she says. “Mercedes gets me to my ayahuasca ceremonies quickly and efficiently and Coke keeps me hydrated.” Her Instagram feed is not one for glamour shots celebrated by 10,000 prayer-hand-emoji comments. She currently has about 6,000 followers, many of whom seem to delight in antics of someone trying to cling to the last vestiges of yoga’s counterculture roots. Ms. Auder has been an instructor for decades, teaching for many years at Kula Yoga Project in New York. She now runs a studio called Magu Yoga in Philadelphia, where she and her husband, the filmmaker Nick Nehéz, moved with their two children five years ago. She has been practicing yoga since the late 1980s and teaching it since 1994. She said she is not making fun of any one Instagram yoga celebrity, but all of them. “It’s a conglomeration of personalities, and when people say they see themselves in my characters, I think that is their problem, not mine. “I think it’s ridiculous for gorgeous wealthy white women to tell anyone what they should love about themselves,” Ms. Auder went on. “Rosemary oil is great for the immune system, fine. But the people who really need a boost for their immune system can’t afford rosemary oil, and they can’t even go to the doctor. So let’s give an Instagram heart for that, shall we?” Ms. Auder’s is one of a handful of social media feeds that holds to account (as it were) the overly branded, idealized version of the yoga lifestyle that has exploded on social media. Others include @shallow_yoga, which features a Barbie doll named Skye Moondust Shallow doing ridiculous yoga poses in ridiculous locations (with captions like, “I hope this picture of me holding my leg up in the air in front of a mirror inspires you to say ‘Because of you, Skye, I didn’t give up’”). Ms. Auder is in fact a performance artist IRL, on many different stages. She has made guest appearances on the HBO series “High Maintenance,” which depicts the interactions between a weed delivery man in Brooklyn and his clientele. (On the show, Ms. Auder plays Gloria, a yoga instructor who tries to win a dance world record.) She also regularly walks the runway for fashion designer Rachel Comey. She comes from a family of activists and artists. “She’s always been outspoken, outrageous, passionate, sensational,” said Ms. Auder’s sister, the actress Gaby Hoffmann. (They have matching “SIS” tattoos on their wrists.) “Now it’s playing out on Instagram, instead of just on the dance floor and the yoga studio and on the sidewalk.” Put another way: “When the machine is corrupted, you are the grit that gums up the works.” This is how Ms. Hoffmann said her “husband-person” (as she calls her partner, the cinematographer Chris Dapkins) described the artistic instincts of Ms. Hoffmann, Ms. Auder and the people who raised them. Ms. Auder is the daughter of Viva Hoffmann, an Andy Warhol superstar, and Michel Auder, the French filmmaker. Ms. Auder and her sister were raised in Room 710 of the Chelsea Hotel, which was a headquarter for a mélange of counterculture artists like Dylan Thomas, Sid & Nancy and Leonard Cohen. After Mr. Auder split from Viva Hoffmann, he married the contemporary artist and photographer Cindy Sherman. (They divorced in 1999.) Alex Auder and Gaby Hoffmann for many years were raised by the triumvirate, and they remain close to these parents. Ms. Auder first tried yoga when she was a senior at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, after having studied at the School of American Ballet (which she got thrown out of for telling an instructor what he could go do to himself). She became obsessed with Jivamukti Yoga Center, a studio and teaching school that has been a yogic home to thousands of Ashtanga disciples over three decades, like Russell Simmons, Sting and Donna Karan. At the time, there were only a handful of yoga studios in the city. “I would sob, I loved it so much,” she said. “I went to two classes a day.” After graduating from Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., Ms. Auder and Mr. Nehéz opened a studio in Rhinebeck, N.Y., before they returned to Greenwich Village, with their baby daughter. The family moved into a bedroom in a townhouse owned by the photographer Annie Leibovitz, for whom Ms. Auder became a daily private instructor. The mattress-on-the-floor family bedroom doubled as an underground studio, where Ms. Auder taught to private clients like Anohni and Parker Posey. She also did private home sessions with clients including Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Ms. Auder might have been the last hippie who still could afford to live in the Village — until Ms. Leibovitz decided to sell the townhouse. Now in Philadelphia, the yoga provocateur is devoting as much time to social media as the mat, with photos of her children, ages 15 and 7, promotional notices of her upcoming classes and videos, like one from last month that shows her with a feather in her hair and a dollar sign painted on her forehead, hitting one doll with a stick for not practicing yoga every day and forcing the legs of another behind its own head. (By the way, that’s an actual yoga pose — yoganidrasana.) People who are offended by her work might be missing the point, said Nikki Vilella, an owner of New York’s Kula Yoga Project, where Ms. Auder still occasionally teaches. “She’s a rabble rouser,” Ms. Vilella said. “I know there are people who think it’s too much, but I don’t think it’s too much. I think the yoga world is asleep. They are numb, walking around with their telephones like robots.”",The New York Times
2019,You Accomplished Something Great. So Now What?,"Career success doesn’t always equal happiness, so here’s how to deal when achieving a goal leaves you feeling empty inside. You finally did it. You got the promotion, secured the raise, finished the project or otherwise leveled up in your career. It’s a wonderful feeling of accomplishment! You should be proud! But then you come down from that high, and reality starts to sink in: Where do you go from here? A little over a year ago, I drove home from the airport with the windows down and the radio on full blast after filming the last scenes for the Netflix docu-series “The Innocent Man.” I was so proud of the work I’d done investigating two wrongful murder convictions in a small city in Oklahoma in the 1980s. This was work that mattered, and I was thrilled to be a part of it. A few days later, I sat in my truck and cried. An empty work schedule yawned before me, and I was sure that my most meaningful achievement was in my rearview mirror. This wave of hopelessness has a name: I was experiencing arrival fallacy. “Arrival fallacy is this illusion that once we make it, once we attain our goal or reach our destination, we will reach lasting happiness,” said Tal Ben-Shahar, the Harvard-trained positive psychology expert who is credited with coining the term. Dr. Ben-Shahar said arrival fallacy is the reason some Hollywood stars struggle with mental health issues and substance abuse later in life. “These individuals start out unhappy, but they say to themselves, ‘It’s O.K. because when I make it, then I’ll be happy,’” he said. But then they make it, and while they may feel briefly fulfilled, the feeling doesn’t last. “This time, they’re unhappy, but more than that they’re unhappy without hope,” he explained. “Because before they lived under the illusion — well, the false hope — that once they make it, then they’ll be happy.” The problem is that achievement doesn’t equal happiness — at least not over the long term. But this isn’t a message that most of us are familiar with. In fact, it’s almost antithetical to the American dream, which tells us that hard work and achievement deliver a happy life. And so we push our children to become captain of the travel soccer squad, a first-chair player in the orchestra and student body president, because we want them to be successful. We want them to be happy. And then, when they’re 34, fresh off a big achievement and so deeply unhappy that they find themselves sobbing in their truck in a Walmart parking lot (hello again, it’s me), they could end up feeling as though something is inherently broken within them. Dr. Ben-Shahar coined the term “arrival fallacy” after experiencing its effects as a young elite squash player. “I thought if I win this tournament that then I’ll be happy,” he said. “And I won, and I was happy. And then the same stress and pressure and emptiness returned.” Research suggests he and I are not alone. He cited a 1998 study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in which professors who had either received or been denied tenure in the preceding five years were asked to rate their happiness. Tenure is the golden snitch of academia: It grants job security, prestige and, usually, a bump in pay, so you’d expect the tenured professors to be significantly more satisfied with their jobs. However, both groups reported similar levels of happiness. This study also asked assistant professors, who had yet to be considered for tenure, how happy they thought achieving that goal would make them. These professors consistently overestimated the amount of joy that was headed their way. That overestimation was most likely a result of something called affective forecasting, said Jamie Gruman, a professor and senior research fellow at the University of Guelph in Canada. “Affective forecasting is our ability to predict how events will make us feel,” Dr. Gruman said. He pointed to a study from 2000 that showed that college sports fans overestimated how happy they would be a few days after their team won a big game. “We tend to be pretty good at knowing what things are going to make us happy and unhappy,” he said, “but we’re not very good at predicting the intensity and the duration of the effect of events.” That can leave us feeling let down after the fact. Achievements also come with consequences we may not always see coming. The tendency to fixate only on the upside is called focalism, Dr. Gruman said. As he tells the students in his business management courses: “You guys want so badly to be managers, but you know what? It’s probably going to be very different than what you think it’s going to be. You know what? You might not even like it.” The same is true of people who gain visibility in most fields. And truly, achieving something — whether it’s an award, a promotion or a bathtub full of Benjamins — doesn’t guarantee happiness, Dr. Ben-Shahar said. “The No. 1 predictor of happiness,” he said, is the “quality time we spend with people we care about and who care about us. In other words, relationships.” However, income matters. “There’s no joy in living in squalor,” Dr. Gruman said. But after basic needs like food, security and clean housing are met, income stops correlating with happiness. In 2012, the World Happiness Report, produced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, said that cooperation and community may contribute more to happiness in wealthy societies than income or other metrics. If relationships make us happy, the fact that many of us neglect our relationships in pursuit of career success may further squelch our joy. Focusing on a career at the expense of, say, a marriage, could ultimately leave us feeling lonely and unmoored. To be clear, acknowledging the power of arrival fallacy does not mean we should settle for a life of mediocrity. “We need to have goals,” Dr. Ben-Shahar said. “We need to think about the future.” And, he noted, we are also a “future-oriented” species. In fact, studies have shown that the mortality rate rises by 2 percent among men who retire right when they become eligible to collect Social Security, and that retiring early may lead to early death, even among those who are healthy when they do so. Purpose and meaning can generate satisfaction, which is part of the happiness equation, Dr. Gruman said. So wait. Reaching a goal can make us unhappy, but setting goals makes us happy? It sounds like a conundrum, but it’s not if you plan correctly, Dr. Ben-Shahar said. His advice is to lay out multiple concurrent goals, both in and out of your work life. This was probably one of my problems. I had focused so intently on finishing one project that I had scrubbed my calendar clean of any other distractions. And the term “goal” can be applied loosely. Even just aiming to spend more quality time with your children or make new friends through volunteer work counts. (If you’re looking for advice on setting goals, read this.) Also, you should banish any sentences like this: “I’ll be happy if I can just achieve X.” Dr. Gruman recently conducted a study in which he asked participants to rate their desire for happiness. The more they thought about how to make themselves happier, or worried about their happiness levels relative to their peers, the less happy they actually were. However, Dr. Gruman’s study also found that participants engaging in activities that made them happy correlated with overall happiness. In other words, don’t think, just do the things that make you feel good. If working hard makes you feel good, then great. Dive in. Just don’t expect getting that promotion or winning that Pulitzer to punch your ticket to bliss.",The New York Times
2019,You Call That a Vase?,"Containers for blooms can stretch the imaginations of designers and florists alike. Vases are vessels meant to hold cut flowers or other foliage. But they often work as decorative objects even when empty. “What I think is appealing about a vase shape is it’s a little miniature piece of table architecture and really open to wild interpretation,” said Richard Wright, the Chicago-based auction house president and specialist in 20th- and 21st-century design. “I also think it’s the type of piece where a designer feels a lot of freedom. It doesn’t have to hold up a human being, it doesn’t have to bear a lot of weight, it just has to hold some water.” (And it doesn’t even have to do that.) Andi Kovel and Justin Parker of Esque Studio in Portland, Ore., found freedom in blowing molten glass vases simultaneously and joining them before they cooled. At that point they continued blowing to puff up the size of the now double vase, which they call Pushmepullme. “The forming is a choreographed dance of fire, molten material and movement, and we both know our part of the dance to the point of pure instinct,” Ms. Kovel said. Bari Ziperstein, of BZippy & Company in Los Angeles, said she was interested in vases that “look like miniature Brutalist monuments or architectural relics,” whether in use or not. Wyatt Little, a ceramic artist in Houston, makes vessels that resemble sneakers, old-school computers and even a dryer vent that was inspired by a trip to a hardware store. “I fell in love with its shape, texture and flexible nature.” Alexandra Cunningham Cameron, the curator of contemporary design at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, said vases historically had served as markers of wealth, industrial progress and cultural style. She cited Ettore Sottsass’s postmodern designs as “a great example of vases that represent a time, a movement and a consumer.” Ditto for Dutch Delftware and Native American black-ware pottery. “Vases quickly define the tools of our age through artistic expression,” she said. “They are loaded with much more than just flowers.” A chat with the man behind New York’s Floresta. Juan Carlo Bermudez — he goes by Carlo — is so rarely seen without a hat that he feels compelled to announce that he has hair. The third-generation member of a flower-growing family in Colombia, Mr. Bermudez, 50, runs his business, Floresta, out of a plain brick building in Long Island City, N.Y. Floresta, which employs his niece and nephew, whom he is grooming to be the fourth generation, handles walk-in requests for birthday bouquets and million-dollar corporate events and weddings. A typical Floresta bouquet might have eucalyptus, berries, a succulent and an artichoke, or it might be an armload of fresh peonies tied with twine. His flowers often come not from Colombia or the Netherlands, but Okinawa, where blossoms are packed precisely and the sweet peas “are super sweet and delicate,” he said. For this assignment, faced with an odd lot of vases, he said his job was not to compete with them, but to flatter them. “They are the bride,” he said. He noted the radical differences in styles. “It was east, west, north, south,” he said. But there were two he would buy. One was Heath Ceramics’ tiny Box and Stopper vase with double openings. “The texture is nice. You can use it for one flower or three.” He especially loved the little stopper, “like a perfume bottle.” The other was BZippy & Company’s Tall Scallop vase, which can be turned upside down. “It’s simple,” he said. “With flowers, it looks nice either way. “I like modern things. If I had the money, I would buy it.”",The New York Times
2019,You Can Make a Treadmill From These Common Household Items (but Don’t),"To be clear, we’re not suggesting this is a great idea. But people across the globe have figured out an easy, if mildly dangerous, way to create a makeshift treadmill in their homes: by pouring soap or shower gel onto tiled floors in kitchens and bathrooms, adding a touch of water, gripping a sturdy surface, then forming a trot by slipping their feet across the self-created hazard. It kind of works. It may not be the ideal form of exercise, and it could very easily go wrong for the clumsy among us, but people worldwide are at least amused by the effort. A video posted two weeks ago on Weibo, a Chinese social network, has been viewed more than 14 million times. A video by Deja Lewis, a 20-year-old student from Gaithersburg, Md., posted Monday, has been viewed more than 17 million times on Twitter. “I held myself up as I was running and when I wanted to stop, I just slowed down and tried to find a dry spot on the ground to put my feet,” she said. Neither was the first to figure out the new form of D.I.Y. exercise. One video of an unidentified man doing the same thing was posted to Imgur on March 26, and another man posted a similar video on YouTube on April 3. Lest you think there’s a vast Treadmill Challenge taking over the internet, à la the Ice Bucket Challenge or the Mannequin Challenge or the InMyFeelings Challenge or any number of other challenges, there hasn’t yet been a wave of imitators. It’s come closest to a phenomenon in China, where thousands of Weibo users have commented on a handful of popular videos. In China, many of those commenters fretted about the possibility of broken bones or chipped teeth, or that the videos could be a bad influence on less graceful, vulnerable children. But others hailed the runners as conquerors, referring to those who subjected themselves to the slippery conditions as “talents” or “those who have defeated the treadmill.” The South China Morning Post assembled videos from those “talents” on Chinese social media. The videos have a slapstick appeal: When the participants speed up, their legs spin like accident-prone cartoon characters. A tension arises as viewers wonder when, or if, the runners will slip, and just how clumsy they will look when they do. Thus far, there has been little payoff for those thirsting for chaos: The runners have almost all remained on their feet. “My feet were slipping backward so I was trying to move my feet forward so I wouldn’t fall on my face,” Ms. Lewis said of her jerky movements in the video. She said she did not fall in her two attempts, but warned that laughing too hard may lead to an accident. The video genre does not lean on political statements or self-aggrandizement, the common sources of internet ire. It is just a goofy thing that is on the internet, a moment of mild ingenuity entirely absent of agenda, and something you most likely never would have thought of or seen if the internet weren’t around. Those still exist.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | You Can’t Trust the Far Right,"The latest scandal in Austria shows that extremists can’t be tempered. Ms. Polyakova is an expert on far-right parties in Europe. With just a few days to go before the European parliamentary elections, Austria’s government is in a tailspin. The implications for the rest of the Continent are profound. On Sunday, Sebastian Kurz, the chancellor and leader of the center-right Austrian People’s Party, called for snap elections following the resignation of Heinz-Christian Strache, Mr. Kurz’s vice chancellor and the head of the far-right Freedom Party. Days before, a two-year-old video surfaced in German media showing Mr. Strache offering government contracts and a stake in one of Austria’s largest newspapers in exchange for Russian support for his party. It turned out that the footage, whose source remains unknown, was a sting operation. But if its goal was to expose Mr. Strache’s cynical willingness to sell out his country to a foreign power with a well-known record of undermining elections, it worked. When Mr. Kurz brought the Freedom Party into government in 2017 as the junior coalition partner, he claimed — and many believed — that doing so would “civilize” the party, which was founded by ex-Nazis and which regularly trafficked in racist and anti-Semitic tropes. (In 2012, Mr. Strache posted a cartoon on Facebook depicting a hooked-nose banker wearing Star of David cuff links, which he claimed was a critique of “greedy bankers” rather than anti-Semitic.) The argument was that by bringing the far right into mainstream politics, its leaders would have to tone down their radicalism and learn to appeal to a broader section of voters. With parties similar to — and allied with — the Freedom Party on the rise across Europe, this seemed to some like a sensible strategy. It was an unmitigated disaster. Not only did the Freedom Party fail to move away from its hard-right positions, it pulled the center right closer to its own extreme ideas on immigration and Islam. But the latest revelations demonstrate even more why Mr. Kurz should never have trusted the Freedom Party in the first place. Other mainstream European politicians facing threats from a growing far right should take heed: pandering to them doesn’t work. For all the rhetoric of national sovereignty routinely espoused by Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini and other populist leaders, Mr. Strache’s fall shows how these supposedly lofty ideas are a cover for opportunism and hypocrisy. In the leaked video, Mr. Strache is seen drinking champagne and eating sushi at a villa in Ibiza, Spain, where he was meeting with a woman claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch with 250 million euros to burn. Among other ideas, he suggests that the woman open a construction company, which he would then ensure received government contracts. As the evening goes on, Mr. Strache comes up with a scheme in which the niece would quietly buy a controlling stake in one of Austria’s most influential newspapers and in return the paper would help “push” the Freedom Party before the 2017 elections. Mr. Strache’s open desire to seek Russian help in influencing his country’s election, while shocking, should not come as a surprise. The Freedom Party entered into a formal coalition agreement with Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party in 2016 and some of its members participated as “election observers” in Russia’s fraudulent referendum during the annexation of Crimea in 2014. And the Freedom Party isn’t unique here. The right-wing League party of Italy signed a similar cooperation agreement with United Russia, and has loudly argued against the sanctions on Moscow which the European Union and the United States imposed in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine. Marine Le Pen’s National Front in France, now rebranded as Rassemblement National, received a loan of 9 million euros from a Russian bank in 2014. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister who has positioned himself as a leading figure of the European far right, also has strong ties to Russia. Mr. Orban openly admires Vladimir Putin’s “strongman” style of politics; following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, he broke with the rest of the European Union and hosted Mr. Putin in Budapest in 2015. In short, Mr. Kurz should have known that he was striking a deal with the devil when he formed the coalition with the Freedom Party. He chose to overlook this. While he now tries to distance himself from the scandal-ridden Mr. Strache, claiming that “there were many situations” he found “difficult to swallow,” his new found indignation rings hollow. What’s worse is that the Freedom Party’s xenophobic and racist ideologies were not enough to turn Mr. Kurz against Mr. Strache. It took Mr. Strache to be caught red-handed selling out his country’s sovereignty to Russia — ironic for a party that, like the rest of the far right movement, has been banging the drum of national sovereignty in its campaign against Brussels. Let’s hope that with Mr. Strache’s cynicism laid bare, Mr. Kurz has learned his lesson. Before the scandal, Austria’s approach to dealing with the far right seemed like a model other center right parties could follow. Now, Austria should serve as a warning call that the far-right parties cannot be “civilized” — or trusted. Alina Polyakova (@apolyakova) is the David M.

2019,Opinion | You Don’t Want a Child Prodigy,"What ‘Roger’ dads do better than Tiger moms ever will. Mr. Epstein is the author of “Range.” One Thursday in January, I hit “send” on the last round of edits for a new book about how society undervalues generalists — people who cultivate broad interests, zigzag in their careers and delay picking an area of expertise. Later that night, my wife started having intermittent contractions. By Sunday, I was wheeling my son’s bassinet down a hospital hallway toward a volunteer harpist, fantasizing about a music career launched in the maternity ward. A friend had been teasing me for months about whether, as a parent, I would be able to listen to my own advice, or whether I would be a “do as I write, not as I do” dad, telling everyone else to slow down while I hustle to mold a baby genius. That’s right, I told him, sharing all of this research is part of my plan to sabotage the competition while secretly raising the Tiger Woods of blockchain (or perhaps the harp). I do find the Tiger Woods story incredibly compelling; there is a reason it may be the most famous tale of development ever. Even if you don’t know the details, you’ve probably absorbed the gist. Woods was 7 months old when his father gave him a putter, which he dragged around in his circular baby-walker. At 2, he showed off his drive on national television. By 21, he was the best golfer in the world. There were, to be sure, personal and professional bumps along the way, but in April he became the second-oldest player ever to win the Masters. Woods’s tale spawned an early-specialization industry. [The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Visit NYT Parenting for everything you need to raise thriving babies and kids.] And yet, I knew that his path was not the only way to the top. Consider Roger Federer. Just a year before Woods won this most recent Masters, Federer, at 36, became the oldest tennis player ever to be ranked No. 1 in the world. But as a child, Federer was not solely focused on tennis. He dabbled in skiing, wrestling, swimming, skateboarding and squash. He played basketball, handball, tennis, table tennis and soccer (and badminton over his neighbor’s fence). Federer later credited the variety of sports with developing his athleticism and coordination. While Tiger’s story is much better known, when sports scientists study top athletes, they find that the Roger pattern is the standard. Athletes who go on to become elite usually have a “sampling period.” They try a variety of sports, gain a breadth of general skills, learn about their own abilities and proclivities, and delay specializing until later than their peers who plateau at lower levels. The way to develop the best 20-year-old athlete, it turns out, is not the same as the way to make the best 10-year-old athlete. The same general pattern tends to hold true for music, another domain where the annals of young prodigies are filled with tales of eight hours of violin, and only violin, a day. In online forums, well-meaning parents agonize over what instrument to pick for a child, because she is too young to pick for herself and will fall irredeemably behind if she waits. But studies on the development of musicians have found that, like athletes, the most promising often have a period of sampling and lightly structured play before finding the instrument and genre that suits them. In fact, a cast of little-known generalists helped create some of the most famous music in history. The 18th-century orchestra that powered Vivaldi’s groundbreaking use of virtuoso soloists was composed largely of the orphaned daughters of Venice’s sex industry. The “figlie del coro,” as the musicians were known, became some of the best performers in the world. The most striking aspect of their development was that they learned an extraordinary number of different instruments. This pattern extends beyond music and sports. Students who have to specialize earlier in their education — picking a pre-med or law track while still in high school — have higher earnings than their generalist peers at first, according to one economist’s research in several countries. But the later-specializing peers soon caught up. In sowing their wild intellectual oats, they got a better idea of what they could do and what they wanted to do. The early specializers, meanwhile, more often quit their career tracks. I found the Roger pattern — not the Tiger (or Tiger Mother) pattern — in most domains I examined. Professional breadth paid off, from the creation of comic books (a creator’s years of experience did not predict performance, but the number of different genres the creator had worked in did) to technological innovation (the most successful inventors were those who had worked in a large number of the federal Patent and Trademark Office’s different technological classifications). A study of scientists found that those who were nationally recognized were more likely to have avocations — playing music, woodworking, writing — than typical scientists, and that Nobel laureates were more likely still. My favorite example of a generalist inventor is Gunpei Yokoi, who designed the Game Boy. Yokoi didn’t do as well on electronics exams as his friends, so he joined Nintendo as a machine maintenance worker when it was still a playing card company before going on to lead the creation of a toy and game operation. His philosophy, “lateral thinking with withered technology,” was predicated on dabbling in many different types of older, well-understood (or “withered”) technology, and combining them in new ways, hence the Game Boy’s thoroughly dated tech specs. Roger stories abound. And yet, we (and I include myself) have a collective complex about sampling, zigzagging and swerving from (or simply not having) ironclad long-term plans. We are obsessed with narrow focus, head starts and precocity. A few years ago, I was invited to speak to a small group of military veterans who had been given scholarships by the Pat Tillman Foundation to aid with new careers. I talked a bit about research on late specializers and was struck by the reception, as if the session had been cathartic. One attendee emailed me afterward: “We are all transitioning from one career to another. Several of us got together after you had left and discussed how relieved we were to have heard you speak.” He was a former member of the Navy SEALs with an undergrad degree in history and geophysics and was pursuing grad degrees in business and public administration from Dartmouth and Harvard. I couldn’t help but chuckle that he had been made to feel behind. Oliver Smithies would have made that veteran feel better too, I think. Smithies was a Nobel laureate scientist whom I interviewed in 2016, shortly before he died at 91. Smithies could not resist “picking up anything” to experiment with, a habit his colleagues noticed. Rather than throw out old or damaged equipment, they would leave it for him, with the label “Nbgbokfo”: “No bloody good but O.K. for Oliver.” He veered across scientific disciplines — in his 50s, he took a sabbatical two floors away from his lab to learn a new discipline, in which he then did his Nobel work; he told me he published his most important paper when he was 60. His breakthroughs, he said, always came during what he called “Saturday morning experiments.” Nobody was around, and he could just play. “On Saturday,” he said, “you don’t have to be completely rational.” I did have fleeting thoughts of a 1-day-old harp prodigy. I’ll admit it. But I know that what I really want to do is give my son a “Saturday experiment” kind of childhood: opportunities to try many things and help figuring out what he actually likes and is good at. For now, I’m content to help him learn that neither musical instruments nor sports equipment are for eating. That said, just as I don’t plan to push specialization on him, I also don’t mean to suggest that parents should flip to the other extreme and start force-feeding diversification. If of his own accord our son chooses to specialize early, fine. Both Mozart and Woods’s fathers began coaching their sons in response to the child’s display of interest and prowess, not the reverse. As Tiger Woods noted in 2000: “To this day, my dad has never asked me to go play golf. I ask him. It’s the child’s desire to play that matters, not the parent’s desire to have the child play.” On the strength of what I’ve learned, I think I’ll find it easy to stick to my guns as a Roger father.

2019,You Really Can’t Go Home Again,"THE edit A few years away from your college town can feel like a lifetime. Near the end of a cold run along the worn, red bricks of my alma mater, I turned to my friend. “Life here,” I said, with more than a hint of sadness, “just kind of moves on.” This was three months ago, nearly four years after I had graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the symbolism was not lost on me. By Mother’s Day, I knew, an entire class of students who began college after I had graduated would have ambled across the stage, shaken hands with their department heads, and Instagrammed a graduation picture with their mothers. That’s what happened this weekend in Chapel Hill, and the scene will likely look similar on college campuses across the country this month, as thousands of seniors reluctantly move out of their apartments and say goodbye to friends to pursue whatever is next for them. If they are anything like I was, they will feel some strange mixture of sadness and pride and anticipation, not knowing whether they should laugh or cry or celebrate. Most will be leaving for jobs or more school or some well-deserved time off after four years of hectic schedules and eating cereal for dinner several nights a week — all the while encountering the pressure to “figure it out,” as if life were a puzzle that needed to be solved as quickly as possible. Their family members — the same people who mere months earlier had told them to enjoy college, not rush through their lives — will ask them when they’ll land a job, find a spouse, start a family, begin saving for retirement. It’s as if as soon as you step offstage with your diploma, you become an adult faced with adult expectations, even though you don’t feel any different and you’re just trying to figure out how to fit your mattress into your car for the drive home. And maybe, four years later, they’ll come back and realize that the rush of college carries on without them. That’s what happened to me. In February, I traveled across the state with my fiancée to visit a college friend and watch a basketball game at UNC, and throughout the weekend I felt, for the first time, that I no longer belonged there. It was a sad, sudden realization, this feeling of smallness, of insignificance. I never would have thought it possible as a student, when everything felt so big and important — economics exams, philosophy papers, work-study jobs, running into friends during the 15-minute transition between classes. But those 48 hours in Chapel Hill taught me that, at 25, I was old and easily replaceable, that no matter how big I felt when I was there, I was painfully small held up to the enduring institutions of college. Some things had changed, of course — new restaurants replaced old ones, stadiums and facilities were renovated, a Target sprang up downtown — but the familiar hum of campus remained. Students still flocked to the same bars (where they were served by the same bartenders), studied in the same libraries, stocked up on cookies in the same dining halls, and walked the same bricks that my classmates and I had four years earlier, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of students who came before us. As I walked those bricks throughout that gray February weekend with my eternally patient fiancée — who tolerated nostalgic musings like, “That’s where we ate lunch every Monday” and “That’s the library where people pretended to study” — I couldn’t help but think there was some nervous out-of-state freshman student fretting over some test or relationship, like I had done so often four years before. And I wanted desperately to find him to tell him that it would all turn out O.K. When I expressed all this to my friend, he said that, on a much more significant level, it reminded him of former President Obama’s comments about the pyramids in Egypt. “There were a lot of people during the period when these pyramids were built who thought they were really important,” Mr. Obama told Doris Kearns Goodwin in an interview published in Vanity Fair. “And there was the equivalent of cable news and television and newspapers and Twitter and people anguishing over their relative popularity or position at any given time. And now it’s all just covered in dust and sand. And all that people know [today] are the pyramids.” As we get older, we gain valuable perspective; that’s life. But I didn’t think that in four years I would feel so removed from the place I lived and loved for an important period of my life. This lesson crystallized right before we left Chapel Hill, when I drove my fiancée to the house where I lived with my best friends for the last two years of college. As I took out my phone to snap a picture of the house, I realized that it looked exactly the same.

2019,You Will Never Smell My World the Way I Do,"Scientists find that whiskey’s smokiness, the smell of beets and lily of the valley perfume can be utterly different depending on your genetic wiring. The scent of lily of the valley cannot be easily bottled. For decades companies that make soap, lotions and perfumes have relied on a chemical called bourgeonal to imbue their products with the sweet smell of the little white flowers. A tiny drop can be extraordinarily intense. If you can smell it at all, that is. For a small percentage of people, it fails to register as anything. Similarly, the earthy compound 2-ethylfenchol, present in beets, is so powerful for some people that a small chunk of the root vegetable smells like a heap of dirt. For others, that same compound is as undetectable as the scent of bottled water. These — and dozens of other differences in scent perception — are detailed in a new study, published this week in the journal PNAS. The work provides new evidence of how extraordinarily different one person’s “smellscape” may be from another’s. It’s not that some people are generally better smellers, like someone else may have better eyesight, it’s that any one person might experience certain scents more intensely than their peers. “We’re all smelling things a little bit differently,” said Steven Munger, director of The Center for Smell and Taste at the University of Florida, who was not involved in the study. The scientists who conducted the study looked for patterns in subjects’ genetic code that could explain these olfactory differences. They were surprised to find that a single genetic mutation was linked to differences in perception of the lily of the valley scent, beet’s earthiness, the intensity of whiskey’s smokiness along with dozens of other scents. “I think it’s a very important finding,” said Stavros Lomvardas, a neuroscientist at Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute, who was not involved in the research either. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The study was conducted in a large room at Rockefeller University in New York City. Around 300 subjects were invited to sit in front of a computer screen surrounded by 150 jars of assorted odors. The screen alerted them to which jar sniff at any given time, and they then rated the intensity of each on a scale from 1 (extremely weak) to 7 (extremely strong) and pleasantness from 1 (extremely unpleasant) to 7 (extremely pleasant). Before leaving, participants provided a blood sample. “We sequence their DNA and look for small differences between people,” said Casey Trimmer, a geneticist and the lead author of the study. (At the time, she was affiliated with the Monell Chemical Senses Center. She now works for Firmenich, a flavor and fragrance company.) The idea that people experience certain scents differently is not new. Scientists have known for a while that for some people cilantro tastes like soap and beets taste like dirt for reasons likely connected to smell. They’ve also known that only some people can detect the chemical that makes urine smell differently after someone has eaten asparagus, and that the scent of a compound in men’s sweat is different depending on one’s genetic code. “Some people find androstenone very disgusting and intense and sweaty (me included),” wrote Leslie B. Vosshall a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University, who identified the genetic code behind the sweaty difference in 2007. “Others find it not too unpleasant and use adjectives like ‘chemical’ or ‘vanilla,’ yet others cannot smell it at all.” What’s different about this study is that it attempted to identify the genetic underpinnings of a broader number of scent-detection differences. You have around 400 olfactory receptors at the top of your nasal cavity, and they activate differently depending on what you’re smelling. “Odors bind and turn on specific detectors, and this pattern of activation tells us if we’re smelling a flower, how strong we find it, whether we like it,” said Dr. Trimmer. “Small changes in the gene for the receptor can change its shape and how well the odor fits, thereby altering perception of the odor.” As they looked for patterns in the genetic sequences and compared them with how the participants rated the scents, the scientists thought that androstenone would be an outlier in that differences can be traced to a single receptor. “But here we show that this phenomenon is not uncommon,” she said. How it matters — beyond giving people a biology-based excuse to refuse to eat beets and buy overpriced whiskey — is that it helps demystify the olfactory system a bit further. “Olfaction is the most important sense for the rest of the animal kingdom,” said Dr. Lomvardas. And though its essential role is less obvious when humans don’t have to sniff out their next meal, it still affects much more than just perfume preference and flavor experience. There is evidence that reduced sense of smell has psychological consequences, he said, and it may offer early clues of an oncoming neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer's disease. Of course, genes are not the only determinant of scent. Rachel Herz, who studies the psychological science of smell at Brown University, calls this new study “great and important” but points out that there are many other factors at play, including attention, past associations and expectations. “There’s also an ability to create odor illusions and flip people’s perception of an odor,” she said. She’s done this by presenting people with a chemical combination and telling them that it’s vomit. She then presented the same chemical combination and told them it was Parmesan cheese. The participants refused to believe that the samples were the same, she said, as one was so clearly disgusting and the other was so clearly delicious.",The New York Times
2019,Young Indians Helped Put Modi in Power. Can He Count On Them Again?,"INDORE, India — At an engineering college in the middle of India, three first-time voters stretched out on classroom benches and debated whether to re-elect Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Monika Khichi supported Mr. Modi, arguing that he was fashioning India into a new world superpower. Her friend, Ajay Kirar, was a bit less sure of how he would vote, describing the election as a “political drama” dominated by two large, flawed parties. Arunoday Singh Parmar, a budding social activist, grimaced at the idea of giving the prime minister another term. He weighed the rise of Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party against shrinking space for India’s minorities. “India is a secular country, but for political benefits, they are trying to make it a Hindu country,” he said. “I am anti-Modi.” Five years ago, young voters turned out in large numbers for the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., seeing in Mr. Modi a soaring orator whose pro-development record suggested he could meet one of the biggest challenges facing India: how to sustain an economy that absorbs hundreds of thousands of new workers every month. How does the election work? Will Modi win? What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters? Exit polls found that turnout in that election among Indians ages 18 to 25 surpassed that of the general population for the first time, hovering around 70 percent. India’s youngest voters were the most likely of any age group to support the B.J.P. [Read the latest updates on India’s election results.] Over the next few weeks, as Indians head to the polls in the world’s largest election, young people will once again mostly back Mr. Modi, according to a pre-election survey. But conversations with them suggest they have some reservations. High unemployment, the spread of Hindu nationalism and a spike in hate crimes against Muslims are among the issues on the minds of newly eligible voters, who number about 130 million nationwide, according to census data. Activists and analysts say India is more divided today than when Mr. Modi was elected. “In 2014, Modi undoubtedly represented hope,” said Ashutosh Varshney, a professor of political science at Brown University in Rhode Island. “In 2019, Modi represents a mixture of fear and hope — fear that the state would punitively hurt and repress those who dissent and disagree, and hope for those who still think he can take India higher.” The demographics are favorable for Mr. Modi in Madhya Pradesh, a vast, mostly Hindu state that votes throughout this month before results are announced on May 23. Some of the prime minister’s youngest supporters in Indore, the state’s largest city, said the B.J.P. had proven itself capable of remaking India from the ground up. They could see it right in front of them. Not too long ago, Indore resembled other crowded Indian cities, with a population of about two million. Mangy animals roamed streets piled with garbage. Waste management was abysmal. Over the past few years, an aggressive cleanup campaign led by the B.J.P.-controlled local government — and supported by Mr. Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or Clean India Mission — changed that. Residents now gush about the improvements, highlighting Indore’s high livability ranking and recent experiments with technology, including a traffic intersection managed by a giant robot. “Indore is the No. 1 cleanest city in India,” said Aaradhya Bhatt, 18, who plans to cast his first vote for the B.J.P. By contrast, Mr. Modi’s primary opponent, Rahul Gandhi, scion of the Gandhi-Nehru political dynasty, was seen by some voters in Indore as worse at governing, speaking Hindi and relating to ordinary Indians. In 2014, Mr. Modi shoveled disdain on Mr. Gandhi’s Indian National Congress, which was mired in corruption scandals. The party’s reputation for slippery deals persists: Mr. Bhatt said that Congress would “give us potatoes and keep gold” if voted into power. Mr. Modi’s young critics agreed that Mr. Gandhi was a tough sell. But mostly they wanted to talk about jobs. Rajat Sharma, 20, who comes from a family of B.J.P. supporters, said he was torn about whom to support after it emerged earlier this year that Mr. Modi’s government had suppressed a report showing a 45-year high in unemployment. Recent data from the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, a research company in Mumbai, showed that India lost as many as 11 million jobs in 2018. The competition for employment is often impossible: Last year, 19 million people applied for 63,000 menial jobs with India’s railways. “Employment is one of my biggest concerns,” Mr. Sharma said. “The Modi government is hiding data from us.” Others said that the B.J.P.’s effort to improve infrastructure by building millions of toilets and electrifying villages was hardly different from policies supported by the Indian National Congress. What did differentiate the two main parties, they said, was the B.J.P.’s interest in furthering Hindu nationalism in India. Mr. Modi rose to political power through Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a far-right Hindu nationalist group. Though he played down that history in the 2014 election, more recently he has embraced a Hindu-first agenda, using a military confrontation with Muslim-majority Pakistan to stoke nationalist sentiment with fervent religious rhetoric. It remains unclear if Mr. Modi’s strategy will work with voters. In December, the B.J.P. suffered its worst defeat in years in elections held across five states, including Madhya Pradesh. Some analysts saw those elections as a referendum on campaigning appealing to communal divisions that had previously worked for the B.J.P. Over breakfast one morning in April, three generations of Mr. Sharma’s family sat on couches behind his aunt’s clothing boutique and pondered the place of religion in Indian politics. Mr. Sharma said hate speech had gotten worse under the B.J.P. as India underwent a “rightward shift.” His uncle, Prem Sharma, 44, saw no problem with the B.J.P.’s muscular assertion of Hindu identity. He viewed it as protectionist. In India’s majority-Hindu neighborhoods, he said, Muslims were not pressured to assimilate, but in a reverse scenario, “Hindus would be forced out.” From the doorway, Seema Sharma, 38, Rajat’s mother, quietly interjected. “Not all Muslims are the same,” she said. Similar conversations drifted through Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, a public university with several thousand students, where Ms. Khichi, 22, and Mr. Parmar, 22, assessed the last five years under Mr. Modi. They thought it was a mistake for the B.J.P. to appoint Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk with a history of demonizing Muslims, as the leader of Uttar Pradesh, India’s biggest state. They agreed that the party’s attempt to rout out black money by invalidating most of India’s currency, known as demonetization, had not really worked. But the question of whether Mr. Modi was responsible for his government’s more polarizing moments divided them. Ms. Khichi, a senior who plans to work for the consulting company Deloitte after graduating, said “bad people” in Mr. Modi’s party were taking advantage of his popularity to insert religion into politics. “It is not Modi who is promoting Hinduism,” she said. “It is the people behind him.” Mr. Parmar raised the case of Gauri Lankesh, an Indian journalist and critic of the government, who was murdered in 2017 by members of a militant Hindu group. After her death, a man who described himself on Twitter as a “Hindu nationalist” wrote: “One bitch dies a dog’s death all the puppies cry in the same tune.” Mr. Parmar pointed out that Mr. Modi was following that person. “It means Modi is supporting him,” he said. The third person in the classroom, Mr. Kirar, 23, said he was still undecided. Choosing between the B.J.P. and the Indian National Congress, he said, was like picking one of two snakes. Regardless of which gets chosen, he said, “they are both going to bite you anyway.”",The New York Times
2019,Your 5G Phone Won’t Hurt You. But Russia Wants You to Think Otherwise.,"RT America, a network known for sowing disinformation, has a new alarm: the coming ‘5G Apocalypse.’ A Russia Today anchor in Moscow preparing to go on air. The network's American version, RT America, has been exaggerating the health hazards posed by 5G networks, the next, most powerful generation of cell phone connectivity.CreditCreditYuri Kadobnov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The cellphones known as 5G, or fifth generation, represent the vanguard of a wireless era rich in interconnected cars, factories and cities. Whichever nation dominates the new technology will gain a competitive edge for much of this century, according to many analysts. But a television network a few blocks from the White House has been stirring concerns about a hidden flaw. “Just a small one,” a TV reporter told her viewers recently. “It might kill you.” The Russian network RT America aired the segment, titled “A Dangerous ‘Experiment on Humanity,’” in covering what its guest experts call 5G’s dire health threats. U.S. intelligence agencies identified the network as a principal meddler in the 2016 presidential election. Now, it is linking 5G signals to brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer’s disease — claims that lack scientific support. Yet even as RT America, the cat’s paw of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has been doing its best to stoke the fears of American viewers, Mr. Putin, on Feb. 20, ordered the launch of Russian 5G networks in a tone evoking optimism rather than doom. “We need to look forward,” he said, according to Tass, the Russian news agency. “The challenge for the upcoming years is to organize universal access to high-speed internet, to start operation of the fifth-generation communication systems.” Analysts see RT’s attack on 5G as geopolitically bold: It targets a new world of interconnected, futuristic technologies that would reach into consumers’ homes, aid national security and spark innovative industries. Already, medical firms are linking up devices wirelessly to create new kinds of health treatments. “It’s economic warfare,” Ryan Fox, chief operating officer of New Knowledge, a technology firm that tracks disinformation, said in an interview. “Russia doesn’t have a good 5G play, so it tries to undermine and discredit ours.” 5G is also a growing point of friction between Washington and Beijing, with each side lining up allies in what has become a major technology race. Moscow and Beijing are seen as possibly forming a 5G political bloc. The Kremlin “would really enjoy getting democratic governments tied up in fights over 5G’s environmental and health hazards,” said Molly McKew, head of Fianna Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington, D.C., that seeks to counter Russian disinformation. RT’s assaults on 5G technology are rising in number and stridency as the American wireless industry begins to erect 5G systems. In March, Verizon said its service will soon reach 30 cities. RT America aired its first program assailing 5G’s health impacts last May, its only one in 2018. Already this year, it has run seven. The most recent, on April 14, reported that children exposed to signals from 5G cellphone towers would suffer cancer, nosebleeds and learning disabilities. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The network distributes its programming by cable, satellite and online streaming. It also posts individual stories on Facebook and YouTube. A declassified U.S. intelligence report, released early in 2017, said that RT videos on YouTube have averaged 1 million views per day, “the highest among news outlets.” Hundreds of blogs and websites appear to be picking up the network’s 5G alarms, seldom if ever noting the Russian origins. Analysts call it a treacherous fog. Anna Belkina, RT’s head of communications in Moscow, defended the network’s coverage of 5G. “Unlike many other media, we show the breadth of debate,” she said in an email exchange. Asked if Mr. Putin’s promotion of 5G technology in Russia conflicted with the health alarms raised by RT America, she said the U.S. network focused on local 5G issues, not “the roll-out in Russia.” “Our American audience expects us to bring American concerns to the front, first and foremost,” Ms. Belkina said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, in the 2017 report, described the network as “the Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet.” The report noted that RT’s most popular video on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign stated that 100 percent of the Clintons’ charity “Went to … Themselves.” The video was viewed more than 9 million times. Later that year, the national security division of the Justice Department forced RT America, formerly Russia Today, to register as a foreign agent. Moscow’s goal, experts say, is to destabilize the West by undermining trust in democratic leaders, institutions and political life. To that end, the RT network amplifies voices of dissent, to sow discord and widen social divides. It gives the marginal a megaphone and traffics in false equivalence. Earlier campaigns took aim at fracking, vaccination and genetically modified organisms. One show called designer tomatoes “good-looking poison.” The network is now applying its playbook against 5G by selectively reporting the most sensational claims, and by giving a few marginal opponents of wireless technology a conspicuous new forum. All cellphones use radio waves. RT America tends to refer to the signals as “radiations,” seemingly associating them with the very strong rays at the far end of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as X-rays and ultraviolet rays, which in high doses can damage DNA and cause cancer. The newest generation of cellphones, 5G, will operate near the highest frequencies of the radio wave spectrum. Its range overlaps with other devices — including a novel class of health therapies used in Russia and China. Electromagnetic spectrum FREQUENCY GAMMA RAYS 300 GHz Novel EHF therapies X-RAYS UV VISIBLE LIGHT 30 GHz INFRARED Airport scanners 300 GHz 5G RADIO WAVE SPECTRUM 3 GHz Existing cellphones 3 KHz ULTRA LOW FREQUENCY Broadcast television (UHF) 300 MHz Electromagnetic spectrum FREQUENCY 300 GHz GAMMA RAYS Novel EHF therapies X-RAYS ULTRAVIOLET VISIBLE LIGHT 30 GHz INFRARED Airport scanners 300 GHz 5G RADIO WAVE SPECTRUM 3 GHz Existing cellphones 3 KHz ULTRA LOW FREQUENCY Broadcast television (UHF) 300 MHz Sources: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Academies of Sciences, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Congressional Research Service, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers By The New York Times But the radio waves used in cellphone communication lie at the opposite end of the spectrum, between radio broadcasting frequencies and the rainbow colors of visible light. The frequencies employed in 5G are higher than those of past cellphones, allowing more information to be relayed more rapidly. Many other devices are expected to follow, including robots, drones and cars that send traffic information to one another. Wireless high-speed communication could transform the news industry, sports, shopping, entertainment, transportation, health care, city management and many levels of government. In January, The Times announced a joint venture with Verizon to build a 5G journalism lab. Over the years, plenty of careful science has scrutinized wireless technology for potential health risks. Virtually all the data contradict the dire alarms, according to public officials, including those at the World Health Organization. Opponents of 5G claim the technology’s high frequencies will make the new phones and cell towers extraordinarily harmful. “The higher the frequency, the more dangerous it is to living organisms,” a RT reporter told viewers recently. The truth is exactly the opposite, scientists say. The higher the radio frequency, the less it penetrates human skin, lowering exposure of the body’s internal organs, including the brain. “5G emissions, if anything, should be safer than previous generations,” said Dr. Marvin C. Ziskin, a medical doctor and emeritus professor of radiology and medical physics at the Temple University School of Medicine. Health concerns were raised last year when a large federal study showed that 2G signals could produce brain cancer in male rats. But officials discounted a direct link to humans, saying people received smaller doses. Nonetheless, RT has taken an active role in stirring up apprehension, casting the debut of 5G in biblical terms. The caption superimposed on a January show read, “5G Apocalypse.” The anchor reported that doctors, scientists and environmental groups were now calling for its ban. RT America taps the ranks of existing anti-cellular activists to wage its 5G campaign. Some have railed for decades against cellphones, power lines and other everyday sources of electromagnetic waves. Much of their work appears not in reputable science journals but little-known reports, publications and self-published tracts, at times with copious notes of dubious significance. They tend to cite each other’s research. It’s unclear how many RT experts realize they are aiding a Russian network or that it acts as Mr. Putin’s mouthpiece. At times, RT simply mines existing videotape and print materials, editing them to reflect its perspective. And the intelligence report noted that some network staffers fail to disclose their RT affiliation when conducting interviews. Even so, private analysts see the 5G attacks as reaching perhaps millions of online viewers — terrifying some, infuriating others. “RT successfully feeds the conspiracy-oriented ecosystem,” said John Kelly, chief executive of Graphika, a network analytics firm. “This effort is having a real impact. It’s bearing fruit.” RT America began its assault last year with a news show captioned “Wireless Cancer.” The featured guest was Dr. David O. Carpenter, a prominent 5G critic. Dr. Carpenter, 82, received his medical degree from Harvard in 1964 and has published hundreds of scientific papers. For decades, he has warned of cancer risks for people living near high-voltage power lines, although federal studies have failed to find credible evidence that would support his claims. “The rollout of 5G is very frightening,” Dr. Carpenter told RT America. “Nobody is going to be able to escape the radiation.” Dr. Carpenter’s scariest alarms have been “widely dismissed by scientific bodies the world over,” according to David Robert Grimes, a cancer researcher at the University of Oxford, and his colleague, Dorothy V. M. Bishop, also of Oxford. They challenged Dr. Carpenter in a journal article that ran months before the RT program aired, calling his main claims “scientifically discredited.” In an interview, Dr. Carpenter defended his work as having “served a major purpose” by revealing a global health threat. He said he was unaware that he had been featured on RT America. “I speak my mind to whomever I talk with,” he said. RT America’s attacks on 5G have multiplied this year. On Jan. 14, the network aired “A Dangerous ‘Experiment on Humanity,’” which again featured Dr. Carpenter. RT followed a day later with “How to Survive Dangers of 5G.” On Feb. 7, a segment claimed that “5G Tech is ‘Crime under International Law.’” Its featured expert was Arthur Firstenberg, who once charged that a neighbor’s wireless gear had hurt his health. He sued for $1.43 million in damages but lost after pressing his claim for five years. The drumbeat continued. “‘Totally Insane’: Telecomm Industry Ignores 5G Dangers,” was the title of a segment that aired March 6. A program on March 14 was aimed squarely at parents: “Could 5G Put More Kids at Risk for Cancer?” The RT reporter told of a California elementary school that recently churned with fear of radiation from a nearby cellphone tower, and how angry parents kept home 200 students. Even as RT America has worked hard to damage 5G, the scientific establishment in Russia has embraced a contrary and questionable position: that the high frequencies of 5G communications are actually good for human health. It recommends their use for healing wounds, boosting the immune system and treating cancer. Millions of Russian patients are said to have undergone such high-frequency therapies. Beauty clinics in Moscow use these high frequencies for skin regeneration, according to a scientific study. One company says the waves can remove wrinkles and fight hair loss. A Rand study once called RT America’s approach a “Firehose of Falsehood.” For its part, Moscow has repeatedly denied allegations of meddling in the 2016 presidential election and has strongly defended RT’s news coverage as socially constructive. Likewise, RT America strongly defended its position on the potential health risks of 5G technology. “Nothing I’ve seen says the book is closed,” Rick Sanchez, an RT anchor on many of the 5G episodes, said in an interview. “I think there’s lots of unanswered questions. Before we commit to something on this scale, shouldn’t we consider if people could possibly be hurt?” Mr. Fox, the operations chief of New Knowledge, the technology firm, said the network’s aggressive spin on 5G suggests Moscow is less interested in serving the public than dulling Washington’s edge in the global race for the digital future. “It’s information warfare,” he said.

2019,Your Best Tips for a Better Uber or Lyft Trip,"Crowdwise CreditCreditGraham Roumieu Who, in a million years, ever thought that the ridesharing idea would fly? You’re going to pay total strangers to drive you around in their own cars? Really now? Well, yes. Services like Lyft and Uber may have decimated the taxi industry and clogged big-city streets with cars. But they also allow millions of drivers to work on their own schedules, permit millions of riders to save money, keep a lot of drunken drivers from taking the wheel, free up a lot of parking spaces, and give just about everyone an endless source of conversation starters. Still, there are challenges for both riders and drivers: Finding each other, communicating with each other, coexisting with each other. That’s why, in the previous episode of “Crowdwise,” I invited you to share your tips for improving the ridesharing experience. Here’s what you came up with. Most people begin by opening the corresponding app (Lyft or Uber, for example). But Phoebe Mortensen noted that you can save time and money by starting in other apps. Google Maps: On the Directions tab, where you see options like driving, public transport and walking, tap the ride-sharing icon: the microscopic man holding up his infinitesimal arm. “At that point, Google Maps shows you price and waiting-time comparisons of Lyft and Uber — information you can’t get in their own apps,” wrote Ms. Mortensen. Once you’ve chosen the service you want, hit Open App to complete the transaction. Apple Siri/Google Assistant: On your phone, you can say, for example, “Hey Siri, get me a ride to 200 West 79th Street with Lyft” or “Hey Google, book an Uber to JFK Airport.” You’re asked to specify the details. Speaking your destination is always less finicky than typing it on glass. Amazon Alexa/Google Home: If you have an Amazon Echo smart speaker, you can say “Alexa, ask Lyft to call a ride” or “Alexa, ask Uber to request a ride.” If your robo-assistant speaks Google instead, say “O.K. Google” instead of “Alexa.” Summoning a ride is easy. Finding your driver can be substantially trickier. You get a license-plate number and car description; the driver gets a tiny photo of your head. If the neighborhood is busy, dark, or nondescript, that may not be enough. If you’re smart, you’ll seek a safer spot. “Your pickup address does not have to be exactly where you’re standing,” driver Jeffrey Castro wrote. “Choose addresses where the driver can pull over and not block traffic. From a safety perspective, everyone benefits, and your neighbors will appreciate less honking.” According to driver Tom Deehan (15,500 Lyft rides and counting), the walk-a-short-distance trick can also save you time and money. “At bar closing time, or after concerts and sporting events, everyone orders their Lyfts and Ubers from the same location, causing traffic jams. Walk a block or two away, and then request your ride. You’ll get picked up much faster and you’ll likely save money on surge pricing.” Finally, often, the app plants your “pin” at the wrong location on the map in the driver’s map. Far better to enter your address manually — or, as Ray Roig noted, to use the name of a building or place of business. “Both Uber and Lyft are built on Google Maps, and the app will recognize the name.” In my call for submissions, I requested tips for making ridesharing “smarter, more efficient, or more economical.” One reader noted sardonically that I must be a man, because I didn’t mention “safer.” She’s right. Getting into a male stranger’s car alone can be frightening if you’re female, especially in the wake of Samantha Josephson’s death at the hands of a man she thought was her driver. When your ride arrives, “ask the driver for the name of the passenger they are picking up. If it’s not your name, or she or he can’t say, do not get in,” wrote Mikki Ashe and, similarly, Carol Mitchell. Salomé Mirigay shares every ride’s details with someone she trusts, using the “Share location” or “Share status” button that appears in the app after a driver has accepted your request. The recipient can then monitor her progress on a live, moving map. “It’s comforting that someone has your itinerary and driver’s information in case of emergency,” she noted. Once you’re in the car, Gillian Horn advises, “sit directly behind the driver. That way, it’s harder for the driver to physically reach you.” “That being said,” added Julia Butler, “I’ve learned that drivers can get just as nervous about picking up passengers as we may get about drivers. One said to me, ‘We drivers have to pass background checks — but I have no idea who is getting into my car.’ So, caution and empathy!” Last safety tip: When you reach your destination, open the door on the curb side. “It’s amazing how many people get out of the car into traffic,” Teri Green observed. After each ride, the app asks you to rate your driver (1 to 5 stars). What you may not realize is that your driver also rates you. (To see your average Uber rating, open its main menu. To find out your Lyft rating, ask your driver, or contact the company.) If there were a Rude Passenger Hall of Fame, no driver would have trouble coming up with nominees: riders who eat stinky or sloppy food in the car, leave the seats covered with crumbs, vape or smoke pot during the ride, slam the doors, make advances on their female passengers, and so on. Those are good ways to get low, low ratings from your drivers. And what difference does your rating make? “If you rate a driver 3 stars or below, Lyft will not match you with that driver again. But drivers have the same option: if we rate a passenger 3 stars or below, we won’t have to deal with them again,” Jean MacDonald revealed. Furthermore, a driver isn’t allowed to refuse your pickup request based on your destination. But Ray Roig reported that they are allowed to turn you down if you have a low rating. Bottom line: Be a jerk, and you’ll have more trouble getting rides. “Crowdwise” readers’ most copious category of tips involved courtesy. “The very first thing I say is, ‘Thank you for picking me up today!’” wrote Glenn Roesler. “It relaxes the driver and often makes them forget, at least momentarily, their last unpleasant rider — and a relaxed driver is always a good thing.” Then there’s the awkward conversation question. How do you say that you’re not in the mood to chat without seeming antisocial? “A nice way to phrase it is, ‘I’m so exhausted. Is it all right if we just listen to music instead of chatting?’” proposed Maria Travaille. “Works every time. Honestly, the driver probably doesn’t really want to talk to you, either.” Or carry a book, wrote Okuta Onfire. “It’s more polite than gazing at your smartphone.” Many, many drivers wrote to say how rarely riders tip them. “Drivers make a lot less than you think,” pointed out driver Jean MacDonald. “Even a small tip is a nice pat on the back.” She points out that Uber and Lyft keep a substantial chunk of the fare you pay — 20 or 25 percent, plus various fees that can eat up another 25 percent — but the driver gets all of your tip. By the way: If you tip in the app, the driver doesn’t find out until after having rated you. That’s one reason Matt Morgan always tips in cash. “The driver gets instant gratification, you make their day better, and you’re bound to get a 5-star passenger rating!” Unless the driver’s behavior was egregious or dangerous, John Bordeaux always gives 5 stars and a tip, “Whatever kind of day I may be having, I’m in the back seat, and they’re fighting traffic.” Most of the time, you probably use Uber or Lyft for immediate pickup from the spot where you’re standing. But that’s not the end of these apps’ flexibility. Physical help: Marjorie NYC discovered Uber Assist, which summons a driver who’s trained and ready to help with big packages, extra luggage, or equipment like wheelchairs, walkers and scooters. It’s available in 40 cities and costs nothing extra. “This feature saved me after surgery and when going to airport with too much luggage,” she wrote. (To find it, slide through the car types at the bottom of the screen to the Assist button.) Order rides for other people (paid by you): Enter your friend’s location as the pickup address, and contact the driver to let him know that you’re not the passenger. That’s handy, wrote Madeline Carter Gooding, for “friends late at night in sticky situations, or family coming in from the airport.” Make multiple stops: In the app, the + button next to the address box lets you add a second destination, a third, and so on. Schedule a ride: You can order a pickup in advance, thereby setting it and forgetting it. In the Uber app, the Scheduled Rides button is next to the “Where to?” box. In the Lyft app, after entering your destination, tap Schedule below the list of car types. Event rides: If you’re hosting a gathering (wedding or corporate event, say), you can prepay your guests’ rides home. You get a code, which you supply to them; it’s valid only during the time slots, within the geographical boundaries, and up to dollar limits you establish. The company refunds to you any amount that wasn’t used up. Here are the details for Lyft and Uber. As it turns out, then, the ingredients for getting more out of ridesharing are common sense, caution, and courtesy. And what do you know? Those are the same principles that should guide us through every social interaction, inside cars or out.

2019,Opinion | Your Car Knows When You Gain Weight,"Vehicles collect a lot of unusual data. But who owns it? Mr. Hanvey is president and chief executive officer of the Auto Care Association. Cars produced today are essentially smartphones with wheels. For drivers, this has meant many new features: automatic braking, turn-by-turn directions, infotainment. But for all the things we’re getting out of our connected vehicles, carmakers are getting much, much more: They’re constantly collecting data from our vehicles. Today’s cars are equipped with telematics, in the form of an always-on wireless transmitter that constantly sends vehicle performance and maintenance data to the manufacturer. Modern cars collect as much as 25 gigabytes of data per hour, the consulting firm McKinsey estimates, and it’s about much more than performance and maintenance. Cars not only know how much we weigh but also track how much weight we gain. They know how fast we drive, where we live, how many children we have — even financial information. Connect a phone to a car, and it knows who we call and who we text. But who owns and, ultimately, controls that data? And what are carmakers doing with it? The issue of ownership is murky. Drivers usually sign away their rights to data in a small-print clause buried in the ownership or lease agreement. It’s not unlike buying a smartphone. The difference is that most consumers have no idea vehicles collect data. We know our smartphones, Nests and Alexas collect data, and we’ve come to accept an implicit contract: We trade personal information for convenience. With cars, we have no such expectation. What carmakers are doing with the collected data isn’t clear. We know they use it to improve car performance and safety. And we know they have the ability to sell it to third parties they might choose. Indeed, Ford’s chief executive, Jim Hackett, has spoken in detail about the company’s plans to monetize car data. Debates around privacy often focus on companies like Facebook. But today’s connected cars — and tomorrow’s autonomous vehicles — show how the commercial opportunities in collecting personal data are limitless. Your location data will allow companies to advertise to you based on where you live, work or frequently travel. Data gathered from voice-command technology could also be useful to advertisers. The data on your driving habits — how fast you drive, how hard you brake, whether you always use your seatbelt — could be valuable to insurance companies. You may or may not choose to share your data with these services. But while you can turn off location data on your cellphone, there’s no opt-out feature for your car. Carmakers use data to alert us when something needs repair or when our cars need to be taken in for service. What they don’t tell us is that by controlling our data, they can limit where we get that repair or service done. For almost a century, car and truck owners have been able to take their vehicles to whichever shop they choose and trust for maintenance and repair. That may be changing. [Technology has made our lives easier. But it also means that your data is no longer your own. We’ll examine who is hoarding your information — and give you a guide for what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.] Because of the increasing complexity of cars and the Internet of Things, data is critical to repair and service. When carmakers control the data, they can choose which service centers receive our information. They’re more likely to share our data exclusively with their branded dealerships than with independent repair shops, which could have the edge in price and convenience. However, independent repair shops currently make 70 percent of outside warranty repairs throughout the country. This is a different facet of the privacy conversation. Our anxiety about data typically focuses on what happens when information is shared with those we don’t want to see it. But what about when information is withheld from those we do want to see it? Imagine visiting a medical specialist and learning he can’t get access to the medical history that your doctor maintains, or having a financial adviser acknowledge that neither of you can see your accounts unless you pay a fee. It’s alarmingly easy to imagine carmakers’ charging fees to independent repair shops that need access to vehicle data to service a vehicle purchased for tens of thousands of dollars. That fee will lead to vehicle owners’ paying higher repair prices just so that technicians can obtain the data. There are more than 180,000 independent repair shops across the country; most have all the tools needed to work on today’s connected and complex cars, and most of today’s highly trained service technicians can perform anything from basic tuneups to sophisticated electronic diagnostics. But without access to car data, they’re working blindfolded, unable to see the diagnostic information they need. The solution is simple. The only person who should control car data is the car owner (or lessee). He or she should be aware of the data the car transmits, have control over it and determine who can see it. The idea that drivers don’t control their own data flies in the face of what consumers want and expect. A 2018 Ipsos survey found that 71 percent of consumers assume vehicle owners already have direct access to their vehicle data. Not so. Nearly 90 percent of consumers believe vehicle owners should control who can see their vehicle’s data. Currently they don’t. Digitization of the auto industry is, ultimately, a good thing. Today’s connected cars are paving the way for autonomous vehicles and vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and eventually vehicle-to-infrastructure communications making our roads safer. But unlike Alexa and Nest, consumers are unaware of the degree to which their own car collects and processes data. It’s clear, because of its value — as high as $750 billion by 2030 — carmakers have no incentive to release control of the data collected from our vehicles. Policymakers, however, have the opportunity to give drivers control — not just so that they can keep their data private but also so that they can share it with the people they want to see it. This will let car owners maintain what they’ve had for a century: the right to decide who fixes their car.

2019,Your Friday Briefing,"Good morning, We’re covering a powerful cyclone, the fight between Democrats and the attorney general and the Indian elections. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated from parts of the country’s eastern coast ahead of the arrival today of Cyclone Fani. The India Meteorological Department said the storm would land with sustained winds of more than 100 miles per hour and gusts of up to 120 m.p.h. More than 100 million people are potentially in the cyclone’s path. The details: As much as eight inches of rain is forecast to fall on the states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The storm is expected to continue north, hitting Bangladesh and Bhutan, as well as parts of the Indian states of West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya. Check our live cyclone tracking map for the latest. Attorney General William Barr left Democratic lawmakers fuming when he failed to appear at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, and they threatened to hold him in contempt of Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Barr of lying to Congress, saying, “That’s a crime.” Response: Mr. Barr refused to show for the hearing because Democrats had insisted that he sit for questioning from committee staff lawyers. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said he would be happy to testify if Democrats dropped that demand. Watch: House Democrats respond to Mr. Barr’s decision. Listen: “The Daily” focuses on Mr. Barr’s Senate testimony this week. Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, sought to strengthen his image as the undisputed commander of the armed forces on Thursday, mustering troops in a televised show of authority a day after the opposition tried to incite a military mutiny that fizzled within hours. “Soldiers of the fatherland, it’s time to fight!” Mr. Maduro said to hundreds of troops in an appearance at the Fuerte Tiuna base near Caracas. Mr. Maduro’s visit seemed to contradict assertions of authority by Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader, who has the support of more than 50 countries but has been unable to turn military commanders to his side. Go deeper: Tareck El Aissami, one of the most powerful leaders of the Venezuelan government and a close confidant of Mr. Maduro, was the target of investigations by his own country’s intelligence agency. According to a secret dossier compiled by Venezuelan agents, Mr. El Aissami and his family helped sneak Hezbollah militants into the country and went into business with a drug lord, becoming a rich man as the economy was in disarray. When Joe Biden was the U.S. vice president, one of his foreign policy roles included pushing Ukraine’s corrupt government to clean up its act. Part of that effort, during a trip to Kiev in March 2016, was threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine’s leaders did not dismiss the country’s top prosecutor, who had been accused of being soft on corruption. It worked. The conflict: Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch in the sights of the fired prosecutor general. Why it matters: The broad outlines of the story had previously been public, but new details about his son’s involvement and the decision by the current prosecutor general to reopen an investigation into the company, Burisma, have pushed the issue back into the spotlight, just as the senior Biden’s presidential campaign begins. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other members of his Bharatiya Janata Party have often described their rivals in the general election as “anti-nationals.” The term doesn’t mean, as one might assume, anti-nationalism. Instead, it seeks to frame criticism of the government as a betrayal of the nation. In the days after suicide bombers attacked Indian soldiers in Kashmir, for example, those who questioned the military or the government’s response were described as anti-national and ridiculed on social media. The term was popularized in the late 1970s, after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency across the country that lasted for 21 months. At the time, Ms. Gandhi faced mounting challenges. Economic distress had led to widespread riots and protests, while a state high court had convicted her of election fraud. Instead of resigning, she installed a curfew and censored the press. She also jailed hundreds of political opponents — many from early predecessors of the B.J.P. — without trial, deriding them as anti-nationals. With the resurgence of the term today, the question is whether it “tells us more about the people accused” or the accusers, writes the journalist and author Raghu Karnad. — Alisha Haridasani Gupta Send us your feedback or questions on this series here.

The word “derby” is synonymous with major horse races. The Kentucky Derby, whose 145th running is Saturday, was inspired in part by England’s Derby at Epsom Downs in Surrey. But the word originates with a city that long predates the United Kingdom. In the first century A.D., Romans began conquering the territory they called Britannia. They established Derventio, a small settlement on the east bank of the Derwent River. According to “Secret Derby,” a book by the British historian Maxwell Craven, the name Derwent is old Celtic: “from deru meaning oak and wen meaning white/pale, thus ‘place/river of the white oaks.’” Some 850 years later, Mr. Craven writes, Saxons established a fortified settlement across the river as a stronghold against Viking attacks. They named it by combining the first syllable of Derventio with the Norse suffix “-by,” meaning town or settlement. Roughly another 850 years later, a reputed coin toss won the 12th Earl of Derby the honor of having a new horse race named for him.

2019,"Hungary, Trump Tariffs, Merkel: Your Friday Briefing","Here’s what you need to know. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with Hungary’s investigation into a deadly boat crash, President Trump’s tariff threats and Turkey’s language of whistles. Hope is nearly gone for the 21 people still missing after the Mermaid, a sightseeing boat carrying South Korean tourists, capsized on the Danube River in Budapest on Wednesday night. At least seven people died. Late Thursday, the Hungarian police said they had taken the captain of the much larger ship that clipped the Mermaid, identified as Yuri C., from Odessa, Ukraine, into custody and had formally requested his arrest. It was the deadliest boating accident in Hungary in 75 years, and a particular blow to South Korea, which lost 304 people, including 250 high school students, in the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014. Details: The boat was clipped from behind by a larger sightseeing ship and began sinking within seconds. Passengers were thrown into the fast-moving current, and many of those rescued weren’t wearing life jackets. What’s next? A criminal investigation is underway. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, said some 200 divers and medical professionals had been sent to the site. South Korea is sending an 18-member rescue team. The country sprang back into election mode on Thursday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s staggering failure to form a government by midnight Wednesday. Mr. Netanyahu is Israel’s first prime minister-elect to be unable to form a coalition after an election, seriously denting the aura of invincibility he has cultivated over a decade in office. Recriminations and finger-pointing over the political crisis foreshadow a contentious campaign. Here’s a guide to the issues surrounding the new elections, set for Sept. 17. At issue: A military draft law that would have conscripted some ultra-Orthodox Jews divided two parts of Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing alliance — the secular ultranationalist faction and the ultra-Orthodox parties. What’s next? Mr. Netanyahu will remain in power until the next vote. Uncertainty over the country’s leadership could hinder the Trump administration’s Middle East peace plan. The president said he would impose a 5 percent tax on all imported goods beginning June 10. If Mexico did not stop the flow of undocumented immigrants across the southern U.S. border, he said on Twitter, the tax would “gradually increase.” An across-the-board tariff on all Mexican goods would exact a serious toll on American consumers and corporations, and is likely to generate significant opposition among businesses. It also jeopardizes the revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, a major goal of the administration. Numbers: In a presidential statement that followed the tweets, he said that tariffs would be raised to 10 percent on July 1 “if the crisis persists,” and then by an additional 5 percent each month for three months. They would remain at 25 percent until Mexico acted, he said. Markets: The Mexican peso weakened against the American dollar, while shares of Japanese automakers fell because many of them have manufacturing facilities in Mexico. Futures that track American stocks suggested Wall Street would open lower on Friday. That was Chancellor Angela Merkel speaking today at Harvard, where she received three standing ovations and paused more than a dozen times for applause in a speech that called for a rejection of isolationism and nationalism. While she never mentioned President Trump by name, her speech laid out a worldview that punctuated her deep differences both with his administration and the forces of right-wing populism and extremism that have emerged in Europe and elsewhere. And she did it on America’s most prominent academic stage. Key points: The chancellor, who has said she will leave politics in 2021, talked about her experience growing up in East Berlin during the Cold War and then seeing the Berlin Wall come down. She also touched on the threat of climate change. Context: Ms. Merkel was there to get an honorary doctor of laws degree. This week is The Times Magazine’s annual New York issue, which is devoted this year to live performance. We picked 12 artists — including, from above left, the opera singer Ying Fang, the rapper Princess Nokia and the subway dancer Ikeem Jones — to demonstrate what it takes to light up the stage. (This feature is best experienced with the sound on.) Uber: In its first earnings report listing its shares, the ride-hailing giant posted slowing growth and a steep loss of more than $1 billion for the first three months of the year, compounding its bumpy start as a public company. France: The main suspect in the bombing last week in Lyon has told investigators that he had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, a French judicial official said. Denmark: Claus von Bülow, the Danish-born man-about-society who in two trials was convicted and later acquitted of twice trying to murder his heiress wife — placing him at the center of one of the most sensational social dramas of the 1980s — died on Saturday at his home in London. He was 92. Climate change: In the past few seasons, climbers scaling Mount Everest have found the frozen bodies of the people who never made it home poking out of the ground — a haunting reminder of climate change. The warming climate has reshaped the entire Himalayan landscape. Russia: President Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia helped “me to get elected,” and then quickly retracted the idea. U.S.: The White House asked the Navy to hide a destroyer named after Senator John McCain during President Trump’s visit to Japan this week, White House and military officials said Wednesday. Navy officials said they didn’t abide by the request, and Mr. Trump said he hadn’t known about it. Italy: Support for the country’s once-prominent Five Star movement has cratered as Matteo Salvini, the interior minister, dominates Italian politics. Snapshot: Above, the beginning of the protests in Tiananmen Square in April 1989. See our collection of photos, hidden from view for decades, taken by a student witness. Britain: When John Cleese, the comedian and Monty Python star, questioned London’s Englishness in a Twitter post, the city’s defenders rose up on social media, saying it was racially motivated. Mr. Cleese rejected accusations that his remarks were racist. French Open results: Here are today’s results for the women and the men. “Bird language”: Long before cellphones existed, Turkish farmers communicated with one another using whistles of varied-pitch frequencies and melodic lines. What we’re reading: This article in Curbed, recommended by Jennifer Jett, our Hong Kong-based digital editor. “The bicycle was liberating for women when it was introduced in the late 19th century,” she tells us. “But they are underrepresented in cycling. So in some places, city planners are trying to accommodate riding with children or groceries — presumably, better for everybody.” Cook: For those who love fried chicken, this Persian-inspired recipe will quickly become a favorite.

And if you have a neighborhood-watch app, here’s how to put the crime alerts into perspective. “The Weekly,” a new TV show from The New York Times, is premiering Sunday on FX and Monday on Hulu. The half-hour show tells one big story every week, featuring different reporters as they investigate the most important stories on their beats. It’s not easy. “We’re basically plugging really excellent world-class television journalism, which is what the production side provides, into this gigantic, world-beating news machine that is the New York Times newsroom,” Jason Stallman, the show’s editor, said. That involves meeting with journalists across the paper, staying ahead of what they are reporting on and asking them to take time away from their other projects to film. Interviewing for a narrative documentary takes hours, requires the right setting and involves a camera crew. Add to that preproduction (the research and planning stage), dozens of hours of filming, then editing and revising, and the process for one episode — there are 30 in the first season — can take months. “It takes an enormous amount of planning, and it takes a huge pipeline of stories, and it takes the cooperation and participation of reporters and editors around the world,” Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor, said. “But we’ve got all that.” See for yourself at nytimes.com/theweekly or on FX and Hulu this weekend.

2019,Your Friday Briefing,"Good morning, We start today with the triumph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the start of European elections, and a trade-war bailout for U.S. farmers. Exceeding all expectations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party took a commanding lead in the country’s parliamentary elections, which had a record turnout of 66 percent. India’s stock market rose 2 percent to a record high. Mr. Modi framed the showing as a triumph by and for ordinary Indians, over those who write off the poor and downtrodden. “If someone is victorious, it is India,” Mr. Modi declared in a thunderous speech to workers in his Bharatiya Janata Party outside its headquarters in New Delhi. “If someone is victorious, it is democracy. If someone is victorious, it is the electorate.” Concession: “Narendra Modi and the B.J.P. have won,” said Rahul Gandhi, leader of the crushed Congress Party. He even lost his seat in Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, which his family’s political dynasty had held for decades, but won a second seat he contested in Wayanad, Kerala. Modi base: In Varanasi, the city of temples and gods where Mr. Modi began his first national campaign five years go, some see a hero, and some a villain. Tensions with Pakistan: India’s nuclear-armed neighbor announced that it had successfully test-fired a ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Voting has begun in races for the European Parliament, elections that have shaped up as a battle for the soul of Europe — between those who want more Europe and those who would water it down. The decades-old project of unity has rarely been more precarious. Overview: Here’s our guide to the voting, a notoriously confusing system made even more so by changing dynamics within the bloc. Voices: Before the vote, our Berlin bureau chief took a 10-day journey to find out what Europe means to Europeans. Her conclusion: “Europe cannot be taken for granted. But neither can its demise.” President Trump unveiled a plan for a $16 billion bailout for farmers hurt by China’s tariffs, an important political constituency. And more companies said they were redirecting supply chains away from China, especially multinationals that provided services to Huawei, the telecommunications equipment giant. Markets: Global markets tumbled, and shares of Qualcomm, Nvidia and other American chip makers fell. China’s options: China could block production of minerals used in iPhones and other technology, a sector it dominates. A similar move by China nine years ago, against Japan, shocked manufacturers around the world and sent prices soaring. Isabella de la Houssaye raised her five children on adventure. When her terminal lung cancer was diagnosed, she decided to go on adventures with each of them, to share lessons about grit, persistence and mindfulness. In January, a reporter and a photographer from The New York Times accompanied her and her third child and only daughter, 22-year-old Bella, as they climbed her last mountain: Aconcagua, the highest summit outside the Himalayas. Australia: The Oscar-winning actor Geoffrey Rush will be awarded 2.9 million Australian dollars in his defamation case against a newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch, the largest such payout to a single person in Australia’s history. Yemen: Saudi airstrikes on Houthi rebel targets have killed thousands of Yemeni civilians since 2015. The civil carnage also remains a liability for the U.S., which supports the Saudi-led coalition and provides warplanes, munitions and intelligence. Paul Manafort: A banker in Chicago has been indicted on a charge that he issued millions of dollars in loans to the former Trump campaign chairman in an effort to obtain a senior position in the administration. Botswana: Elephant hunting will resume in the southern African country after a five-year prohibition, over the objections of some conservationists. U.S.: Rape victims have recently filed a series of lawsuits against law enforcement authorities in an attempt to force officials to improve how they handle these crimes. Britain: A new BBC comedy series, “Tonight With Vladimir Putin,” uses a three-dimensional cartoon of the Russian president to interview real guests in front of an audience. “He doesn’t often get mocked and I don’t think that he’ll like it,” one expert said. Philippines: Canada said it would take back thousands of tons of trash it had sent to the country several years ago. World Cup: FIFA abandoned plans to expand the 2022 tournament in Qatar to 48 teams from 32. Snapshot: Above, damage was widespread in Jefferson City, Mo., after a burst of dangerous weather struck the American Midwest. The extreme weather is expected to continue for at least another day. In memoriam: Binyavanga Wainaina, 48, the acclaimed Kenyan author, inspired a generation of writers and became one of the most prominent Africans to publicly identify as gay. Baseball: Carter Stewart, a 19-year-old pitcher from Florida, turned his back on the M.L.B. draft to start his career in Japan. Could others do the same? What we’re reading: This story in The Atlantic about the spider Hyptiotes and its unique web. “The spring-loaded trap was first documented 150 years ago by a Civil War surgeon, but the high-speed physics of its attack apparatus are just now being understood,” says Remy Tumin on the briefings team.

Millions of Americans will be grilling and eating hamburgers this weekend for the Memorial Day holiday. Today, the concept is simple: a beef patty on a bun. But the history of the hamburger is a winding food tale that dates back to the first century, when Romans served a minced meat dish. Hamburg was known for its high-quality beef, so when German immigrants began going to the U.S. in the mid-19th century, restaurants began offering a “Hamburg-style” chopped steak. When the burger went from a bare patty to a sandwich style is in dispute: County fairs in New York, Wisconsin and Missouri at the turn of the 20th century all lay claim to sightings of the first hamburger.

2019,Your Friday Briefing,"Good morning, We’re covering why U.S.-China trade talks fell apart, a new immigration proposal from President Trump and the last voting in India’s huge election. Twice this week, President Trump has made clear that he does not want to go to war with Iran, pushing back against two of his most hawkish aides — the national security adviser, John Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who have been at the vanguard of rising tensions. On Wednesday, during a morning meeting in the White House Situation Room, Mr. Trump told his acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, he did not want war, according to several administration officials. Mr. Trump repeated the sentiment on Thursday, during a visit by the Swiss president, Ueli Maurer. U.S. intelligence: Three officials told our reporters that it was photos of missiles on small boats in the Persian Gulf that raised U.S. concerns about rising threats from Iran. The idea is that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps could fire the missiles at U.S. ships. Reaction: The White House, the Pentagon, the C.I.A. and America’s allies are divided over how seriously to take the intelligence. Those in the Middle East are watching with “a mixture of disdain and weary exasperation,” our correspondent in Cairo writes. Catch up: Our explainer covers where we are and how we got here. Weeks ago, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, seemed confident the trade war with the U.S. would subside. He suggested China would honor American demands to protect intellectual property, encourage foreign investment, and buy more goods and services from abroad. But then Chinese negotiators sent a rewritten draft agreement, a move that prompted President Trump to accuse Beijing of reneging on the terms of the deal. Now Mr. Xi, after apparently misjudging how far he could push the U.S. side, risks being backed into a corner, unable to compromise between his own positions and Mr. Trump’s. How we know: Our reporters interviewed more than a dozen people, including current and former officials, researchers, lawyers, and trade experts familiar with the deal and how it fell apart. What’s next: Mr. Trump said he would meet Mr. Xi during a Group of 20 leaders meeting in Japan next month, which would at best pave the way for more talks. Related: Mr. Trump’s latest move to restrict the Chinese technology giant’s ability to buy American components takes a straight shot at Huawei’s global business. President Trump announced a new proposal in a speech in the Rose Garden that would scale back family-based immigration. The new focus would be a merit-based proposal, which he said would rely on a points system that would reward immigrants with skills and education. Response: Resistance from Republicans, and derision from Democrats. “It ain’t happening,” said the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer A new study found that a chain of islands near Australia was covered with mountains of plastic — some 414 million pieces that added up roughly to the weight of a blue whale. The ocean’s plastic problem is twofold: There’s a lot of it — the study’s authors estimate that there are more pieces of plastic in the ocean than there are stars in the Milky Way — and it kills marine life. Shortly after voting in India comes to a close on Sunday, the curtain will inch up the last act of the largest election in history. The official results won’t be announced until next Thursday, but local news media will immediately begin to talk about the exit polls conducted over the weeks of voting. Expect lots of predictions. And here are a few things to look out for in the tangle of headlines. First, watch for results from Valsad, Gujarat, and West Delhi. These two constituencies have voted for the overall winner in every election since 1977, according to “The Verdict: Decoding India’s Elections.” “Interestingly, there is not one bellwether constituency among the southern states of India,” write the co-authors, Prannoy Roy and Dorab Sopariwala. That exemplifies the south’s political difference from the rest of the country. Second, look at voter turnout figures. Mr. Roy and Mr. Sopariwala found that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party performs better in constituencies where turnout dips below 60 percent. That may reflect the B.J.P.’s focus on organization. The party has large numbers of ground-level volunteers who mobilize supporters on voting day. — Alisha Haridasani Gupta Send us your feedback or questions on this series here.

Bicycle makers of yore — meaning in the 1800s — had yet to discover gearing. In the hunt for speed, “velocipedes” came to rely on one huge wheel, with a second wheel for stability and balance. That was the style Britain dubbed the penny-farthing, because it looked like a giant penny paired with the much smaller farthing coin. It offered a thrilling but forbiddingly dangerous ride. But the 1800s were a time of invention. An Englishman named John Kemp Starley introduced a radical improvement in 1885: the “Rover safety bicycle,” with two same-sized wheels. A few innovations later, he had the basics of what has been called “the most influential piece of product design ever” — a bike with a triangular frame, and pedals that power the even-sized wheels with a chain and gearing. The bicycle has become the most popular personal transport in the world. Estimates of the number of bikes in use around the globe run upward of two billion. That’s it for this briefing.

2019,Opinion | Your Gas Stove Is Bad for You and the Planet,"To help solve the climate crisis, we need to electrify everything. Mr. Gillis is a former New York Times environmental reporter and a contributing opinion writer. Mr. Nilles is a managing director at Rocky Mountain Institute. OAKLAND, Calif. — We have some good news that sounds like bad news: Your gas stove has to go. We know how you’ll feel reading those words. We used to love cooking with gas, too. But if our society is going to solve the climate crisis, one of the things we must do is stop burning gas in our buildings. Nobody is going to shed a tear about having to switch to a more efficient furnace or water heater. But people feel emotional about gas stoves, and the gas industry knows it. Seeing this fight coming, the industry is already issuing propaganda with gauzy pictures of blue flames. What the gas companies will not tell you is that your stove is a danger not just to the world’s climate but also to your own family’s health. We’ll explain in a moment. First, here’s the larger situation: The need to tackle climate change is beyond urgent. We are running out of time. Within the next decade we need to cut climate pollution in half in the United States, roughly, to do our fair part in preserving a livable planet. Despite the Trump administration, the nation is actually making progress in some areas. We are retiring coal-burning power plants at a record pace, and half of them are already gone. A new wave of ambition to address climate change is sweeping across state legislatures this year as more and more commit to 100 percent clean electricity or debate doing so. But despite this progress, the Rhodium Group estimates that climate-altering emissions in the United States increased 3.4 percent last year from the year before, one of the biggest jumps in decades. Burning gas is now a bigger source of such pollution than burning coal, and nearly a third of that gas is burned in homes and commercial buildings. But despite the rising chorus of climate pledges by state and local governments, none of them has really tackled the problem of gas in buildings. In fact, gas companies are still being allowed to spend billions extending new lines, connections that will have to be capped off long before the end of their useful lives if we are to meet our climate goals. Getting gas out of existing buildings is going to take a while, clearly, so new buildings are the right place to start weaning ourselves from this addiction. California is poised to go first. In Berkeley, Councilwoman Kate Harrison is proposing a ban on gas hookups in new buildings, part of an effort to make sure the city follows through on its 2018 declaration of a “climate emergency.” Other cities are studying the issue, and Los Angeles announced an ambitious plan this week. Once California cities show it can be done, we hope action will spread across the country. The ultimate goal of this switch-over is to run more and more of the economy on electricity, a strategy known as “electrify everything.” This makes sense because as renewable energy displaces fossil fuels, the electric grid will get cleaner and cleaner. People of a certain age may be thinking: Hold on. All-electric “Gold Medallion Homes” were a thing half a century ago, at a time when electricity prices were falling. Those homes were promoted heavily by the power industry and by Ronald Reagan, a pitchman for General Electric. But they became albatrosses for their owners when electricity prices eventually rose. Why do all-electric homes make sense now? Because technology has come to the rescue, in the form of devices called heat pumps. They run on electricity, but far more efficiently than the electric appliances of our parents’ generation. So if we start installing them now, then as the electric grid gets greener, our buildings will be contributing less and less to climate change. You might never have heard of heat pumps, but you already have one in your home. A heat pump is the core technology in your refrigerator. It is basically a loop involving a pump and a compressor that sucks heat out of the interior and blows it into the kitchen, and it can do this even when the interior of your refrigerator is colder than the air in the room. A heat pump can replace both your furnace and your air conditioner. In the winter, it sucks heat in from the outside, even when the weather is cold, and blows it into your house. In the summer, a heat pump runs in reverse, cooling the house. Highly efficient heat-pump water heaters are also widely available. Building a new all-electric home powered by heat pumps is already cheaper than building with gas because you avoid the costs of gas lines and ventilation. For older homes the economics vary; a Rocky Mountain Institute study found the cost of installing and operating a heat pump over its lifetime can be more expensive or less expensive — plus or minus 10 percent — than having a gas system. And as heat pumps become standard in new buildings, the market will scale and costs will fall for both new and old homes. Stoves actually use very little energy, but until people are convinced there are superior alternatives to gas stoves, we will not be able to get rid of gas lines to buildings — and start saving large amounts of money by shutting down the gas distribution system. Once again, technology has come to the rescue. Induction cooktops, running on electricity, are superior to gas stoves. These devices use magnetic waves to heat up pots, and cooks who have tried them quickly fall in love. The perceived advantage of gas stoves is pinpoint control of heat, but induction cooktops are more precise, and faster. For now, induction cooktops are generally more expensive than gas stoves. At retail, 30-inch gas cooktops generally run $500 to $1,000, while induction cooktops of that size run from $800 to $2,000. A change to induction cooking would make sense even if the climate were not a concern, because gas stoves are polluting our homes. Over the past decade, a growing body of scientific evidence has shown that gas stoves throw off pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. When you are cooking, those invisible pollutants can easily reach levels that would be illegal outdoors, but the Clean Air Act does not reach inside the home. Scientists link gas stoves to asthma attacks and hospitalizations. In 2008, Johns Hopkins scientists urged doctors to advise parents of asthmatic children to get rid of their gas stoves or at least install powerful exhaust hoods. Asthma is a rampant, discriminatory disease, hitting children and communities of color the hardest. For health and climate reasons, we think people who can afford to switch now need not wait for prices to fall. Enlist a good contractor, replace gas appliances with heat pumps and cap off the gas line. At the same time, state incentive programs should be designed to ensure all families can make this transition as quickly as possible, regardless of income. The sooner you make the switch, the sooner you can show off your sleek new induction cooktop to the neighbors and let them know that all-electric living is back, not a moment too soon.

2019,"Opinion | Your House Is My House, Pakistan’s Rich Say to Its Poor","Property scams start from the top here, and cut across political divides. Mr. Hanif is a Pakistani novelist. KARACHI, Pakistan — Pakistan is in the middle of an unusual property boom. Developers grab large tracts of land, stealing them outright or occupying them, advertise mega development projects and then buy off regulators with the money they raise selling some of the land they dubiously claim. Poor people who have lived in their homes for generations are served eviction notices and visited by bulldozers in the dead of night. On one side of my house in Karachi is a market. It’s a typical Pakistani market, with car mechanics, barbers, milk and bread sellers, drapers. During the last few years, many of the shops have turned into real estate agencies. One day I counted 153 before giving up. Agents who can’t afford to own proper offices sit on the sidewalks and deal there. On the other side of my house, some 600 yards away, is the Arabian Sea. In the last couple of years, part of the sea has been reclaimed for a military-run housing scheme. Where once there were murky waves, you can now buy what is advertised as a “super hot” 300-square yard plot for 200 million rupees (more than $1.3 million) That’s in the extension of the Defense Housing Authority’s Phase 8 development project — which is being extended even though it is mostly unpopulated. People who buy these plots aren’t buying them to build houses: They hold on until they can sell one plot here to buy two others elsewhere. I live in Phase 5, and it, too, still has lots of empty plots. To Pakistanis struggling to keep a roof over their heads, the government and the courts can be positively hostile. In October, residents of Pakistan Quarters, a 70-year-old residential development in Karachi, were given just 10 days to leave their homes. (After protesters clashed with police, the deadline was extended. The matter is still in court.) In an ongoing clearance drive, this weekend bulldozers went to a place called Gharibabad — literally, the neighborhood of the poor — and destroyed more than 50 homes. Empress Market, the city’s oldest market, was demolished overnight in November. Many commercial areas in Karachi where the poor trade with the poor are being declared illegal. Last year, real-estate dealers and builders and others held street protests here against a Supreme Court decision that suspended a mega housing project because the owners of the land were accused of having acquired it illegally. The court reversed its decision in April after hearings that sounded like a long, drawn-out auction, during which the builders offered to pay, first, 200 billion rupees, then 435 billion, then 450 billion and, finally, 460 billion rupees (about $3 billion). In exchange, other proceedings involving corruption allegations would be halted. The court has yet to decide what to do with the money, but the provincial government has claimed it. The Pakistani courts are very generous with people who build illegal mansions or luxury apartment buildings. Just last month in Islamabad, several thousand people were evicted from E-12, a self-built slum adjacent to posh mansions, where some had been living for more than a decade. A few months before, the country’s highest court had regularized the construction, at One Constitution Avenue, Islamabad, of a plush building complex to be called the Grand Hyatt Hotel — a project whose legality the city’s own development authority agency has challenged. Prime Minister Imran Khan owns an apartment in the building. Property scams start from the top and are never called scams. They cut across political divides, even the biggest divide of them all: between civilian and military authorities. The former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was convicted of corruption partly for failing to account for four apartments in Mayfair, London. Asif Zardari, a former president, and some of his relatives bought several properties in France, Britain, the United States and Dubai, apparently through illegal bank accounts. The current prime minister’s closest and most senior minister, Aleem Khan (no relation), is being investigated for a multibillion rupees housing-development swindle. At the top of Pakistan’s property ladder sits the army, which has developed vast housing estates in all major cities. Although these were meant to be for retired officers and their relatives (and never for just soldiers), the plots are often sold to the highest bidders. It’s a lucrative business: People know that governments come and go, but the army is here to stay, and its housing societies, too. That doesn’t make them a safe investment, though. One army-run estate in Lahore was designed for the families of disabled soldiers or soldiers killed in service. People invested billions of rupees to buy property there at subsidized rates; an estimated 13 billion rupees have disappeared. One of the accused is a brother of the former Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. In a rare flourish, one of the Supreme Court judges hearing a related case told the army’s lawyer, “It seems that you people run the business by using widows and martyrs as a shield, and you pocket royalties in their name.” When Gen. Raheel Sharif, Pakistan’s last army chief, retired, he was awarded 88 acres of land — the nation’s gift for his services, I guess. The land was meant for farming. But Mr. Sharif serves in Saudi Arabia as the head of some vague force that will supposedly rid us of terrorism. He doesn’t have time for farming. Land grabbing in Pakistan probably started with the birth of the country. People made fortunes either by occupying or claiming properties left behind by people who fled during Partition in 1947. You can still find entire estates and villages named after bureaucrats, who had basically allotted them to themselves. Much of this land was acquired on the pretense of agricultural development; it has become gated communities and golf courses. Before he was elected prime minister, Mr. Khan promised to build five million low-cost houses if he came to power. An initial groundbreaking ceremony was held only this month. Mr. Khan owns nearly 40 acres on the top of a hill in Islamabad, which he says he bought after selling property in London — which he’d bought with money he made as a star cricket player. Any number of laws were broken so that he could build a mansion there. A special federal commission was set up (after Mr. Khan took office) just for the purpose of regularizing that arrangement. No commission has been set up, though, to regularize the housing rights of the residents of E-12 or Gharibabad, or Pakistan’s soon-to-be-homeless.

2019,Your Kids Think You’re Addicted to Your Phone,"The kids are all right. But the parents? Since 2016, adults have grown much more concerned about the time they spend on mobile devices even as their teenage children have grown far less worried about their own use, according to a new report from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit children’s advocacy and media ratings organization. “If you’re concerned about your own device use, which an increasing number of parents are, then you ought to be able to impart that wisdom to your kids,” said James P. Steyer, the organization’s chief executive. “That’s your job.” The report, released on Wednesday and based on surveys of 500 pairs of parents and teenagers, found that both groups have a complicated relationship with the devices — and, of course, with each other. Most parents worry that their kids are addicted to the devices, but about four in 10 teenagers have the same concern about their parents. Here are a few of the report’s key findings: The findings that Mr. Steyer and the report’s author, Michael Robb, said were most worrying related to how parents and teenagers allow mobile devices to interfere with sleep. “That’s important because we know that healthy sleep is associated with a range of positive outcomes and poor sleep is related to a range of negative outcomes,” said Mr. Robb, the senior director of research for Common Sense Media. According to the survey, conducted online and by phone in February and March, 26 percent of parents said they used a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet, within five minutes of going to sleep. The same share acknowledged waking up to check the device at least once during the night, while a slightly smaller share, 23 percent, said they used a device within five minutes of waking up. The rates were higher among teenagers: 40 percent said they used a device within five minutes of going to sleep; 36 percent admitted to waking up to check a device; and 32 percent said they used a device within five minutes of waking up. “It’s a huge wake-up call,” said Mr. Steyer, who, along with his wife and four children, sleeps with his phone in a separate room. Teenagers were more than twice as likely as adults to sleep with a phone in bed, the study found, with 29 percent of teenagers and 12 percent of adults admitting to the practice. The survey findings were adjusted to mirror the demographics of the actual population of parents with teenagers. The margin of error was about 4.4 percent. Curiously, Common Sense Media found that while parents feel increasingly glued to their phones, attitudes among teenagers moved in the opposite direction. “It’s interesting and it’s unexpected,” Mr. Robb said. This year, for example, 52 percent of parents said they spent too much time on mobile devices, nearly twice as many as in 2016. Among teenagers, only 39 percent said they spent too much time on the devices, a steep decline from 61 percent. The share of parents who felt “addicted” to their devices rose to 45 percent from 27 percent, while the share of teenagers who said the same fell to 39 percent from 50 percent. It wasn’t clear why attitudes among parents and teenagers diverged, but Mr. Robb offered some theories. Parents, he said, may be internalizing widespread news coverage of the repercussions of smartphone use. Children, on the other hand, may be suffering from normalization as fewer and fewer teenagers remember a time before such devices were ubiquitous. When it comes to actual use, though, both groups seem to have converged: Among parents, 42 percent said they checked their devices a few times an hour, while 43 percent of teens said the same. One of the strangest findings of the survey, according to Mr. Robb, was that parents and teenagers were more worried about each other’s use, yet arguing about it less. Today, about four in 10 teenagers believe their parents are addicted to or spend too much time on their mobile devices, the survey found. Among parents, six in 10 worry about their children being addicted to their phones and seven in 10 say their children spend too much time on the devices. For both groups, though, the share who reported arguing daily over how the other uses mobile devices fell from about a third to about a fifth. “Both kids and parents are arguing less, but at the same time they are feeling that the other is more distracted,” Mr. Robb said. “It’s a really weird finding.” It isn’t clear why families are arguing less about device use, but Mr. Robb and Mr. Steyer said it might be caused by apathy or resignation over the hold mobile devices have. There is some hope, though: About two-thirds of parents said they had family rules governing the use of mobile devices, according to the survey findings. “We’ve been saying for years at Common Sense that you need to have ‘sacred spaces,’” Mr. Steyer said. “There are times and places where phones, in particular, but all digital platforms should not be there. The bedroom is the obvious one.”",The New York Times
2019,Your Past Is Not Your Future: Overcoming Time Management Regret,"Time management regret is a jail cell with an open door. Your positive actions are what may grant you an opportunity to walk free. You may have been passed up for a promotion. You may have lost a job. You may have spent years in a Ph.D. program. You may have forfeited a marriage. You may have missed your kids’ grow up. You may have squandered your health. You may have misplaced your confidence. It doesn’t matter. How do I know this? Because I’ve been a time management coach for the last 10 years, and I’ve seen clients come to me with all of these regrets — all caused by poor time management — and I’ve watched them break free. You are in jail of time mismanagement, but the only person keeping you there is yourself. I still believe in you. I know your time management past does not have to define your time management future. Here are four areas where you will need to make changes so you can be free to manage your time. Don’t let it manage you. You’re imprisoned by this if you’re not willing to admit regret about your past yet. And when you do have the opportunity to make more balanced time choices now — you don’t take them. When perhaps your kids ask you why you weren’t around when they were young, you won’t confess that you’re secretly remorseful about opportunities you may have lost by not having a handle on your time management. You might think something like this, “Sure I rarely saw my kids awake when they lived at home, but I got promoted faster than anyone else in my division.” You may even be resistant to taking personal responsibility for your actions in the present because of a hangover from the past. You might think something like, “Well my wife would like me home for dinner now that the kids are gone. I could do that but then I might need to explain why I didn’t make it home for dinner for the last 25 years. I don’t want to have to do that.” There are times and stages of life where we really don’t have a choice about working longer hours. I honor the men and women who do what it takes to make ends meet when they have no other options. But there are cases where you really did have a choice and where your choice to not manage your time hurt people you care about and who care about you. In those cases, defensiveness, what relationship expert Dr. John Gottman describes as “self-protection in the form of righteous indignation or innocent victimhood in an attempt to ward off perceived attack,” feels like it’s protecting you but really it’s keeping you jailed. You’re avoiding feeling guilty, embarrassed and some potential “I told you so’s,” but that avoidance keeps you stuck in the patterns of the past. And it leads to unnecessary wedges between you and those closest to you in the present and future. To break the chains of being overly defensive about the way you’ve managed your time up to this point, some self-forgiveness is in order. Own and admit your past mistakes and then forgive yourself. This could sound like, “I forgive myself for not planning my time well and missing significant events in my children’s lives,” or “I forgive myself for not setting boundaries with work so my marriage and health suffered.” Once you look honestly at your past reality, you can turn your attention to the present and make changes going forward. If you think, “Why bother? I’m so far behind that nothing I do will really make a difference,” learned helplessness may be your prison. This is a way of perceiving the world in which you become inappropriately passive following exposure to uncontrollable events in the past. Sure you have the time to work on a project now, but you’ve already missed the first two deadlines because of circumstances beyond your control so you surf the internet instead. Since past experience has told you that your efforts do not have the power to improve your situation, you justify not acting as avoiding effort that won’t effect change. Your passivity is your way of feeling in control of a seemingly uncontrollable situation. In the short-term, it insulates you from the sting of trying, and the very possibility of failing. But in the long-term, it is a 100% guarantee of a longer sentence in the jail of regret. Try something. Anything. Don’t focus on whether the trying gets you great results, or even any results at all. Just be happy you did something: Open that project document you’ve been avoiding for weeks and read it for 15 minutes. You’ll be 15 minutes further along than you were before. Sometimes getting started means everything, and you never know, once that 15 minutes has passed, you may be engaged enough to spend another 15 minutes on it. Leave work in enough time to exercise before you go home for the night. You won’t be a beefcake overnight, but you’ll be one exercise session healthier than you were before. Every time you take positive action — no matter how small — you accumulate factual evidence that you can do something to improve your time management, and those small things add up. This may be your prison if you start to move forward and make positive changes — but then the consequences of your past time management mistakes makes you feel so badly that you stop. You can’t concentrate because all you can think is: “If only I hadn’t wasted so much time, I would be so much further along. I can’t believe that I let things get this bad. How could I have missed so many opportunities to get this done?” These thoughts feel like punches to the gut. Instead of continuing to move forward, you escape the beating by stopping entirely and distracting yourself with something less emotionally charged, which means you never finish the changes that could free you and improve the way you manage your time. If this sounds like you, you’re really avoiding the pain of reality. The wasted time, money, and opportunity and the fact that your actions lead to that reality — can be harsh to face, but necessary if you want to be able to reflect on past mistakes and move on. Similar to how individuals recovering from addiction can go through a period of depression when they become sober, starting to take positive time management action, can feel worse before it feels better. If you allow self-criticism about the past to stall you, you will continue to make choices that lead to regret. However, you can choose to use regret as a positive force in your life and learn what not to do. So when a self-critical thought comes up like, “I really screwed up. I can’t believe how far behind I am on this project,” you can think, “Yes, I’m behind because of my past choices. But I don’t want to get any further behind so I am going to commit the time I can to moving ahead on it now. If I do what I did before, I will only make the situation worse.” All of us feel guilty from time to time over missed opportunities and to-dos we never got around to. However, guilt may be your prison if you neglect to set boundaries with people because you may have messed up in the past. So maybe you are doing good work now, but you know that you wasted quite a bit of time last year. You feel guilty for not having met the expectations set for you and worried about being “found out.” Because you feel regret over those time management choices, you answer work phone calls at 10:30 p.m. at night or stay plugged into email all weekend. You don’t feel worthy of honoring your own needs. In this case, you’re really avoiding conflict, or the potential of it. Because you feel uncomfortable about past events, you allow yourself to be controlled by other people. You want to avoid upsetting them, and to “prove” your worth. You fear setting a boundary and then having them bring up past mistakes, or try to use those mistakes as leverage against you today. Once you’ve made things as right as possible from the past, you are free to leave the jail of regret and to move on. You have the right to decide what is or is not good for you, and a little conflict now to take control of your time will save you even more conflict later. You must have the courage to set boundaries to make wise time management choices in the present and to have a sustainable, healthy lifestyle in the future. Dealing with all of these will likely cause some emotional pain in the short-term. There may be a few days, weeks, or even months, depending on the severity of the circumstances, where it really hurts. But on the other side is the freedom to manage and control your own time without worrying about the expectations of others, or being chained to your own emotional demands. The only way to be who you desire to be and do what you desire to do is to break free.

2019,"Your Questions about the New Adversity Score on the SAT, Answered","The College Board, the company that administers the SAT exam, unveiled a new tool for admissions officers this week that measures the economic and social adversity that test takers have faced. The adversity score, which the College Board calls a measure of “disadvantage,” is meant to help schools diversify their student bodies without looking explicitly at race. Here’s how the rating works, what information it includes and leaves out, and how education experts are reacting: The score includes 31 pieces of information meant to measure social disadvantage across two broad categories: the student’s neighborhood and the student’s school. None of the factors directly reflect an individual student; all of them are about the census tract in which the student and his or her classmates live. And none of the measures include race or ethnicity. The goal is to find students who have transcended their environments by examining factors that are correlated, according to research, with lower academic achievement and lower lifetime earnings. Some of the neighborhood factors are: median family income, percentage of households in poverty, percentage of single-parent households, percentage of vacant housing units, percentage of adults without a high school degree, percentage of adults without a college degree, percentage of adults with agriculture jobs and the unemployment and crime rates. The school social measures look at a similar list of factors across all the census tracts of the students in the applicant’s school. The rating system potentially benefits gentrifiers on neighborhood factors, but its two-pronged approach balances that to some degree by also looking at a student’s school. Many middle-class and affluent parents living in poor neighborhoods do not send their children to local schools alongside low-income peers. According to the College Board, each of the 31 factors are weighted equally to generate a score between 1 and 100. A score of 50 is an average level of disadvantage; higher scores mean a student has faced more adversity. The environmental context measure does not affect the student’s SAT score; it will be presented to admissions officials as part of a bigger package of data about the student. It is up to the college how to use the adversity measure or whether to use it at all. Several scholars said that while the score provides important information, it should also include information on the individual student, and not just the student’s neighborhood and school. “If you’re a really well-educated, higher-income family living in a poor neighborhood, this measure is going to overstate the disadvantage you face,” said Sean Reardon, a professor of education at Stanford University. But, he added, “The question is not whether it’s perfect, but whether it’s better than the alternative of what colleges have had access to, to date. It sounds like this will be better than nothing.” Financial aid documents already allow admissions officers to access information about many students’ individual characteristics, including family income and assets. Perhaps most notably, the new College Board tool, known as the Environmental Context Dashboard, contains no information on the student’s race or ethnicity, or on the racial makeup of the student’s neighborhood or school. Some admissions officers “work in states that prohibit the use of race as a factor in admissions,” said Connie Betterton, a vice president at the College Board. “We wanted to make this tool that could be used by all of our members.” Left unsaid is that many college officials are anticipating a potential Supreme Court ruling that could roll back the consideration of race in admissions. Sheryll Cashin, a law professor at Georgetown and expert on educational and neighborhood inequality, said that by ignoring race entirely, the tool misses a crucial element of academic disadvantage — one that operates independently of economic, family and crime factors. “What society tends to do is we tend to overinvest the whiter the neighborhood is and disinvest the blacker the neighborhood is,” she said. “Not having that information is a true oversight if you really are interested in understanding adversity.” A study on a pilot version of the dashboard, conducted by the College Board and researchers from the University of Michigan and Harvard, found that it resulted in more offers of admission to low-income applicants. Jessica Howell, vice president of research at the College Board, said her team had drawn from a broad array of social science in developing the tool, including research by the Harvard economist Raj Chetty on the impact of neighborhood on lifetime earnings and academic achievement. Among the scholars who consulted for the College Board was Richard D. Kahlenberg, a fellow at the Century Foundation and a proponent of class-based affirmative action. He said he would like to see the College Board tool evolve to also include information on a student’s individual family. Still, he called the measure “an enormous step forward.”",The New York Times
2019,Your Surgeon’s Childhood Hobbies May Affect Your Health,"Medical schools are noticing a decline in students’ dexterity, possibly from spending time swiping screens rather than developing fine motor skills through woodworking and sewing. Could you tie a series of square knots around the neck of a teaspoon without, even slightly, moving the teaspoon? How about using tweezers to extract a grape from inside a roll of toilet paper, without piercing the grape’s skin or touching the sides of the roll? Aspiring surgeons should have the dexterity to accomplish such tasks. But increasingly, they don’t. Faculty members at medical schools in the United States and Britain have noticed a marked decline in the manual dexterity of students and residents. Some say it’s because of fewer hands-on courses in primary and secondary schools — shop class, home economics, drawing, painting and music. Others blame too much time spent tapping and swiping screens rather than doing things that develop fine motor control like woodworking, model building and needlework. While clumsiness is a growing concern in medical schools, the extent and permanence of the problem are unclear. “There is a language of touch that is easy to overlook or ignore,” said Dr. Roger Kneebone, professor of surgical education at Imperial College London. “You know if someone has learned French or Chinese because it’s very obvious, but the language of touch is harder to recognize.” And just like verbal language, he thinks it’s easier to acquire when you’re young: “It’s much more difficult to get it when you’re 24, 25 or 26 than when you’re 4, 5 or 6.” Dr. Robert Spetzler, former president and chief executive of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, agreed. “Think about the difference between someone who has learned to ski when they were a little kid and someone who spent a long time, perhaps even the same amount of time, skiing as an adult,” he said. “That elegance that you learn when very young, doing that sport, can never be equaled by an adult learning how to ski.” Dr. Spetzler earned a reputation as a virtuosic brain surgeon during his more than 40 years operating. He said he developed his dexterity as a child by playing the piano. And he began performing surgery in high school — on gerbils. All of them survived. “The sooner you begin doing a physical, repetitive task, the more ingrained and instinctive that motor skill becomes,” Dr. Spetzler said. “What makes a great surgeon is unrelenting practice.” Indeed, the scientific literature is replete with studies that show a correlation between surgeons’ experience and patient outcomes. The more procedures a surgeon performs, the more likely their patients will have shorter hospital stays, suffer fewer complications and, most important, survive. That creates a problem for today’s medical students, particularly those lacking dexterity, because of rules on how much they can work. The introduction of the maximum 80-hour workweek in 2003 had the unintended consequence of limiting surgical residents’ availability to participate in operations and refine their skills. It’s estimated that work restrictions cause residents to lose a year’s worth of experience. “When I trained, good or bad, I worked about 120 hours a week. That was just expected,” said Dr. Thomas Scalea, a trauma surgeon and professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. “Today the average resident finishes with around 900 operative cases. I finished with twice as many.” It’s also true that there are now more kinds of surgery to learn. While surgery used to require cutting the patient open, advances in technology have created more minimally invasive procedures using scopes and programmable instruments like the Gamma Knife, which uses focused radiation to destroy tumors rather than having to remove them. Some of the newer technologies demand less manual dexterity and more of the kinds of skills and reflexes one acquires playing video games. But nevertheless, they require repetition and experience to do well. “Medical students today have to be trained much more broadly on a wider range of methods than earlier generations,” said Dr. Douglas Tyler, professor and chairman of the department of surgery at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “Because of the magnitude of knowledge and all the different technologies, now people more commonly go into fellowships, picking one area to specialize in,” so they can build confidence and competence. But even if the procedure is not one that requires exceptionally fine motor skills, some still worry that medical students who are “all thumbs” — meaning their primary experience working with their hands is thumb-typing on their phones — may be deficient in ways other than just dexterity. Dr. Maria Siemionow, a transplant surgeon at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago, recalls spending hours in her youth crocheting sweaters and also cutting out pictures and words in magazines and gluing them into elaborate collages. Such creative endeavors not only develop dexterity, she said, but also require a three-dimensional imagination, planning, patience and precision. “If you see the little stitch is pulled too tight or you glued something improperly, you have to repeat and learn how to do better,” she said. “It’s these basic skills you also need to be a surgeon.” Dr. Siemionow led the team of surgeons that conducted the first near-total face transplant in 2008 and spends much of her time now conducting research and training residents in how to perform intricate surgical procedures under a microscope. She said it’s very easy to tell who is not going to make it: “They are already in their residencies and yet, they don’t have a good feeling about their hands and you observe them getting frustrated, they are impatient, there is blood all over.” She believes students can be trained to be great surgeons, but they need to come in with baseline skills. Dr. Siemionow said that as a child growing up in Poland, she was always making things in school. “From what I see, it’s a wake up call, that schools need to do more to encourage creativity and three-dimensional thinking,” she said. She and colleagues also wonder if it may also be time to reconsider how medical students are selected for surgical programs when at least 30 percent to 50 percent of complications from surgical procedures are potentially avoidable. The current system picks surgical trainees based on intellectual capacity. “We look at their grades and their test scores, their productivity, like writing papers and doing research, but the reality of being a good surgeon has nothing to do with that,” said Dr. Michael Lawton, who succeeded Dr. Spetzler as president and chief executive of Barrow Neurological Institute. “What matters is how they handle the instruments and what kind of touch they have with tissues, as well as how they react and adapt when under stress in the operating room.”",The New York Times
2019,Your Thursday Briefing,"Good morning, We’re covering the rising U.S. tensions over Iran and the costs of the trade war and taking a close look at a purported cure-all. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has been partially evacuated in response to what the Trump administration calls a threat linked to Iran. The U.S. has also been accelerating its movement of ships and bombers into the Persian Gulf. Skepticism: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that the Trump administration had received intelligence related to “Iranian activity” that put American facilities and service personnel at “substantial risk.” However, U.S. allies and Iraqi officials have voiced skepticism, as has Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, the British deputy commander of the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, or ISIS. In Iraq: Some people in Baghdad told our reporter the tensions were “just talk,” but she found more concern in government and security circles. Iraqi officials say they are taking steps to avoid war. President Trump moved to ban American telecom firms from installing foreign-made equipment that could pose a threat to national security. The decision effectively bans sales by Huawei, China’s leading networking company. Pentagon and intelligence officials warn that Chinese firms could intercept secure messages or shut down networks during a conflict, disrupting American infrastructure like gas pipelines and cellphone networks. Go deeper: The biggest threat to global fortunes is the intensifying conflict between the U.S. and China, the two largest economies on earth, our economics correspondent writes. One casualty: The Alibaba Group, China’s largest e-commerce company, reported its second-slowest pace of revenue expansion since early 2016. More on trade: The U.S., Mexico and Canada are nearing a deal on metal tariffs, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, potentially ending a standoff that has heightened tension among the three countries since President Trump imposed the duties last year. Mr. Trump is also expected to delay a decision to impose tariffs on automobile imports. Eyes are turning to the Supreme Court after the Southern state of Alabama approved a ban on almost all abortions, and it was signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican. The measure threatens doctors with nearly a century in prison for terminating a pregnancy unless the woman’s life is in serious danger. There is no exception for cases of rape or incest. What’s next: The law will go into effect in six months at the earliest, but lower courts will almost certainly block it. Supreme Court: There is no guarantee that justices would hear a case involving the law, even though it was constructed to be a direct challenge to the court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which guarantees a woman’s right to end her pregnancy. Our top legal correspondent says the court’s conservative majority will have many simpler opportunities to chip away at abortion rights. Big picture: Alabama is the seventh U.S. state to pass abortion restrictions this year. Women have made it into leadership positions, drive social movements, thrive in local village governance and wield hundreds of millions of voters in India. But the women running for Parliament in the current elections still face an uphill battle — especially those outside local or national dynasties. At campaign stops, they find themselves forced to play up the protection of male politicians. The numbers: Female representation in Parliament is just over 11 percent and is unlikely to increase. By contrast, Nepal’s Parliament is 33 percent female, Pakistan’s is 21 percent and Afghanistan’s 28 percent. Looking forward: Women are expected to vote in record numbers this year. Election results are due on May 23. And calls for finalizing legislation that would give women a minimum 33 percent quota of seats have picked up in recent weeks. Cannabidiol is a molecule derived from the cannabis plant, and CBD-infused products that promise vague but powerful benefits seem to be everywhere in the U.S. Plenty of legitimate research is being done on CBD, and many scientists are excited about its possibilities. The Times Magazine looks at how, in this unusual moment, it has come to be seen as a cure-all. Facebook: The company put restrictions on live-streaming, in its strongest response yet to the live video of the mosque massacres in New Zealand in March. Facial recognition: With a vote on Tuesday, San Francisco became the first major city to ban the use of the technology by the police and all other municipal agencies. Airline safety: The acting head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration defended the agency’s certification procedures involving the now-grounded Boeing 737 Max airplane, telling the House Transportation Committee that having company-paid employees inspect their own aircraft was “a good system.” Germany: Authorities raided 11 financial offices, including some local public-sector savings banks known as sparkassen, as part of a widening investigation into tax evasion that originated with Deutsche Bank. Afghanistan: New details on a recent Taliban attack showed how insurgents infiltrated a vital Afghan army base, demonstrating the weaknesses of the Afghan army. Metropolitan Museum of Art: The museum said it would stop accepting money from members of the Sackler family who are behind Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. Snapshot: The new Paris Cafe at the former T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport in New York. The swooping Eero Saarinen landmark has opened as a hotel. Denmark: Joachim Olsen, a current member of the Danish Parliament, paid to have his face and slogan plastered on Pornhub, a pornographic website. The goal was to reach voters “where they are,” he said. James Charles: The influential beauty blogger lost millions of followers after a fellow blogger posted an angry video accusing him of betrayal. What we’re reading: This two-part series in The Washington Post.

Smarter Living: The term “emotional labor” refers to the invisible and often undervalued work involved in keeping other people comfortable and happy.

This Sunday, HBO will show the final episode of the final season of “Game of Thrones” to audiences in more than 170 countries. And while some viewers live in fear of running across a spoiler, others embrace the idea of getting a jump on the plot twists. They may be on to something. In a 2011 study, psychologists at the University of California, San Diego, found spoilers could enhance enjoyment. They gave people various short stories with one of three presentations: a spoiler paragraph before the story, a spoiler edited into the beginning of the story, or unspoiled. Subjects preferred the advance spoilers. A later study found that they help people to better understand the plot. However, another study found that the medium mattered: People enjoyed spoiled episodes of “The Twilight Zone” less. Then there’s anecdotal evidence. The Times’s Jenna Wortham got over having the “Game of Thrones” episode known as “The Red Wedding” ruined, and now relies on spoilers as “virtual Xanax.” She doesn’t, however, dish them out.

2019,Your Thursday Briefing,"Good morning, We‘re covering the Indian election, Chinese surveillance and President Trump's domestic battles. The results of nearly six weeks of voting are set to be announced today, and The Times will have live coverage later this morning at nytimes.com and on our apps. The election has become a referendum on the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Exit polls suggest he is headed for another five-year term. Background: Mr. Modi has cast himself as a strong leader who can protect India, while the opposition argues that his Hindu-first politics have made the country less tolerant and that his economic agenda has failed. Here’s a guide to our coverage of the issues that have shaped the election, the world’s largest democratic exercise. High-tech surveillance has turned the Xinjiang region in western China into an incubator for automated authoritarianism that could spread across the country and beyond. The system used there, created by a state-run defense manufacturer, uses military cyber techniques to monitor civilians. Software sorts through billions of records to match faces from surveillance cameras to names, addresses, official identification numbers — and education history, family ties, even recent visits to places like hotels or internet cafes. “It is a virtual cage,” our correspondents write. Related: The Trump administration, arguing that China is using technology to strengthen authoritarianism at home and abroad, is considering limits on Hikvision, a Chinese manufacturer of video surveillance products. Like the telecom giant Huawei, it could be halted from buying American software and semiconductors without approval from Washington. Mobile carriers in Britain and Japan were reconsidering their ties to Huawei after Google’s decision this week to cut off support to the company. Trade war: President Xi Jinping has urged China to begin a modern “long march,” invoking a turning point in Communist Party history to suggest that Beijing has abandoned hopes of a trade deal with the U.S. in the near term. As Democrats weigh impeaching the president, Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Mr. Trump of “a cover-up.” Infuriated, he walked out of a meeting with her and the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, and delivered a bristling statement to reporters in the Rose Garden, telling Democrats they should “get these phony investigations over with.” We’re tracking all the inquiries. The Mueller report: The Justice Department has agreed to release some intelligence materials related to the Mueller report to the House Intelligence Committee. That staves off Democratic action to try to force compliance. Mr. Trump’s taxes: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that it would be “unlawful” for him to release the president’s tax returns to Congress — and that he was trying to determine who in the Internal Revenue Service wrote a draft legal memo concluding that he must do so. But New York State passed a bill that could give Congress a new way to gain access to them. Trump associates: Newly released search warrants detailed Michael Cohen’s communications with an investor tied to Russia. Rogue emissions of a banned, ozone-destroying gas were known to be coming from somewhere in East Asia. International researchers have been able to narrow the source further, to two provinces in eastern China. The findings confirm the results of several investigations, including one by The New York Times, which found that factories in Shandong, one of the two named provinces, were making or using the gas to manufacture foam insulation. The science: CFC-11 is one of a class of compounds called chlorofluorocarbons that are potent greenhouse gases. They destroy atmospheric ozone, reducing protections from UV radiation, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage in people and is harmful to crops and other vegetation. The response: China has denied any serious violations of the ban on the chemical. The Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment said it was preparing answers to questions about the new findings that The Times sent last week. Some 200,000 Jews live in Germany, a nation of 82 million people, and many are increasingly fearful. Anti-Semitic crimes have risen sharply, and bullying in schools is rampant. Some see a connection to “imported anti-Semitism” or “Muslim anti-Semitism” brought into the country by immigrants from the Middle East. Some see the greater peril as coming from an emboldened extreme right that is hostile to both Muslims and Jews, the latter for reminding them of their guilt for the Holocaust. China: The country’s three biggest airlines and one smaller carrier are demanding compensation from Boeing, having grounded dozens of 737 Max jetliners since a deadly crash in March. Bangladesh: The government has imposed a 65-day national ban on coastal fishing, the most restrictive ever in the country. It could help restore depleted fish stocks, but fishermen say it has left them jobless and desperate. Indonesia: Violence has erupted in the capital, Jakarta, after the newly announced results of April’s voting, in which President Joko Widodo was re-elected. New Zealand: The coming budget of the center-left government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is moving away from traditional bottom-line measures like productivity and economic growth and instead focusing on measures that encourage the “well-being” of citizens. Business: Qualcomm, the giant in the semiconductor industry, violated antitrust laws by charging cellphone makers excessive licensing fees, a judge in the U.S. has ruled. U.S.: John Walker Lindh, a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan in 2001, is set to be released from an American prison today after serving 17 years of a 20-year sentence for providing support to the Taliban.

Observers of Ramadan around the world participate in a variety of traditions. One that spans cultures and regions is the way the daily fast is broken: with a date. The date has been a flourishing crop in the Middle East for thousands of years. It appears at least 20 times in the Quran and hadith, a collection of sayings and traditions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and other early Muslims. Muhammad even suggested starting each day by eating seven dates. There’s also a nutritional component. After a long day without any water or food — sometimes up to 20 hours, depending on the region — it’s not advisable to immediately gorge. Nazima Qureshi, a nutritionist who observes Ramadan, says the date offers electrolytes, including potassium (more than in a banana), magnesium and calcium, as well as fiber, which is filling. It also has a low glycemic index, making it a great natural sweetener for desserts like stuffed dates and coconut date balls. That’s it for this briefing.

2019,Your Thursday Briefing,"Good morning, We’re covering the Barr hearings in the U.S., the relationship between food and climate change and a startling case of police violence in Australia. Attorney General William Barr spent much of Wednesday answering questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the special counsel’s report on Russian election meddling and possible obstruction of justice. Mr. Barr defended the four-page summary that he released of the report, which the special counsel, Robert Mueller, criticized in a letter that was released by the Justice Department as failing to capture the “context, nature and substance” of the 448-page document. Partisan focus: Democrats pressed Mr. Barr on why he had not publicly acknowledged concerns about his original summary and why he asserted that Mr. Trump had cooperated fully with the investigation when he tried to thwart it. Republicans focused not on Mr. Trump or Mr. Mueller’s report, but on Hillary Clinton’s emails and the former F.B.I. officials who opened the Russia investigation. Go deeper: Read our reporter’s takeaways from the hearing. What’s next: The House Judiciary Committee voted to allow staff lawyers to question Mr. Barr on Thursday. Mr. Barr has said he will not appear under that format. See for yourself: Watch clips from the hearing. The Trump administration’s accusations that the telecommunications giant acts as a spy for the Chinese government, means that Huawei must prove it is trustworthy to maintain lucrative global business ties. But “its soul is steeped in Communist Party culture,” writes our New New World columnist Li Yuan, and the company’s internal structures resemble the party, from the power of its top leadership down to its team-building activities. Related: Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, fired her defense secretary, accusing him of leaking sensitive information about the government’s internal deliberations about Huawei and its decision to let the company build out its 5G network. Trade talks: As the U.S. and China work toward closing a trade deal, there’s one thing that Beijing is unlikely to yield on: control over the data that American companies collect on their consumers inside China. A nuanced ruling by the highest court in international sports will force female athletes with elevated levels of male hormones to take suppressants to compete in certain international track races. The ruling is a defeat for Caster Semenya, a two-time Olympic champion in track and field from South Africa, who had previously challenged a proposal to limit testosterone levels. The ruling by the arbitration court was also watched closely by transgender athletes. The court said restrictions on permitted levels of naturally occurring testosterone were discriminatory, but that such discrimination was a “necessary, reasonable and proportionate means” to preserve the integrity of women’s competition. Response: Ms. Semenya said in a statement issued through her lawyers that the decision “will not hold me back. I will once again rise above and continue to inspire young women and athletes in South Africa and around the world.” Her lawyers are considering an appeal. What’s next: If she wants to keep participating at major international competitions, she faces some hard choices: take hormone-suppressing drugs; compete against men; or enter competitions for intersex athletes, if any are offered.

Patrick Cumaiyi waved to his family with shackled hands as he boarded a plane to Darwin, the capital of Australia’s Northern Territory, to face a domestic-violence complaint. Before takeoff, an argument broke out, an officer delivered a sharp blow to Mr. Cumaiyi’s head, and another officer dragged him headfirst onto the tarmac. Medical records obtained by The New York Times suggest he was a victim not only of police brutality — a persistent problem for Indigenous Australians — but also a cover-up.

It was unclear whether the antigovernment demonstrations were a convincing rejoinder to the setback he suffered on Tuesday, when military commanders asserted their allegiance to President Nicolás Maduro. Julian Assange: A British court sentenced the WikiLeaks founder to 50 weeks in jail for jumping bail when he took refuge in Ecuador’s embassy in London seven years ago.

Netflix: The video streaming giant and SK Global Entertainment, the production house that made the film “Crazy Rich Asians,” acquired the rights to the story of the 12 boys and their soccer coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand in July. Do-it-yourself treadmills: Internet users are posting videos of themselves exercising using nothing more than soap, water, a slick hard floor and maybe a lack of common sense.

And we asked you for the best advice anyone’s ever given you, and how it made an impact on your life. Here’s what you said. A recent feature by our Berlin bureau chief tracked how Germany’s far-right has adopted anti-immigrant tropes in discussing an influx from Poland of “the most notorious fairy-tale baddie”: the wolf. Connecting nationalism and fairy tales is not new. The Brothers Grimm, who based their tales on folk tradition, lived and worked in the 19th century, when Europe was brimming with enthusiasm for the nation-state over multi-ethnic empires. Artists and writers reached for ancient myths to feed the ideal of a national culture. That legacy lives on in not only children’s books but also concert halls: Jean Sibelius picked tales from the Finnish national epic “Kalevala,” and Bela Bartok collected folk songs from the former Austro-Hungarian empire. But populists picking up the tales and myths often seems far from the artists’ intentions. “Even if musical folklore once owed a debt to nationalism, today, ultranationalism hurts it so much that the damage is far greater than the benefit once was,” Bartok wrote in an essay in 1937. Earlier this week, we told you about South Korean grandmothers who are learning to read and write for the first time.

2019,"Huawei, India, Rihanna: Your Tuesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re covering the impact of U.S. efforts to shut out Huawei, the future of India’s government and Rihanna’s next act. If exit polls are to be believed, India seems poised to bring back Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The official results, scheduled to be announced Thursday, will reveal what kind of government voters want for the country. A victory for Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would confirm that Indians want a strong national leader, a contrast to the weak, messy coalitions that have governed in the past. Takeway: Mr. Modi fits the mold of the political strongman; many such figures have risen to power around the world, from the U.S. to Turkey. He stirs huge crowds, projects a macho image of his country abroad, speaks to voters directly via Twitter and has the ability to stoke nationalism. Perspective: Voters hoping that Mr. Modi would be a Reaganesque figure who would shrink the government’s role in the Indian economy shouldn’t hold their breath, according to author Ruchir Sharma. “India’s political DNA is fundamentally socialist,” he writes in an Op-Ed. Google’s decision to cut Huawei off from many Android hardware and software services is the first ripple effect from the Trump administration’s order last week to bar the Chinese telecom giant from buying American technology. The move will have serious ramifications for Huawei’s international business, blocking it from future versions of the operating system that powers its smartphones and limiting the apps it has normally preloaded on Huawei devices sold around the world. International chip makers have also started stepping back from dealings with the Chinese firm. Inside China: The country has already walled off one-fifth of the world’s internet users by restricting what users inside its borders can see. In isolating Huawei, the U.S. will only speed up China’s digital isolation. Go deeper: “If China and the U.S. have begun a technological Cold War, then the Huawei order can best be seen as the beginnings of a digital Iron Curtain,” writes our New New World columnist, Li Yuan. President Trump instructed Donald McGahn, his former White House counsel and a key witness in Robert Mueller’s investigation, to skip a congressional hearing scheduled for Tuesday in Washington. The White House cited “constitutional immunity” as the reason for Mr. McGahn to defy the subpoena. Since the release of the Mueller report, House Democrats have sought Mr. McGahn to publicly give his account of events. Reminder: Mr. McGahn was cited frequently in passages where Mr. Mueller examined whether the president obstructed justice, detailing episodes in which Mr. Trump intended to use his position to protect himself from the Russia inquiry. What’s next? House Democrats indicated that if Mr. McGahn skips the hearing, they would vote on whether to hold him in contempt of Congress. That could result in the House turning to a federal court to enforce the subpoena. The country, which has a growing ethnic Chinese population and strong economic ties to China, has become a case study in Beijing’s attempts to steer debate and influence policy inside a democratic trading partner. Representatives of Beijing routinely lobby Australian politicians behind closed doors, and supporters of the Chinese government have sought to suppress criticism in the Australian news media. It is a sophisticated campaign that has left the country debating how to respond. New evidence: The Times obtained a recording of a closed-door gathering in Sydney in 2017, in which the Chinese consul general urged about 100 people — Australian residents and citizens of Chinese ancestry — to shape public opinion by coordinating rallies in support of a visit by China’s prime minister, Li Keqiang, and reporting on critics. Global concern: China’s playbook is most evident in Australia, but many countries are grappling with Chinese efforts to boost its geopolitical standing and maintain its authoritarian power at home. The Barbados-born pop star and fashion icon upended the barriers that black, immigrant women in the U.S. face to step into a fantasy of abundance few could imagine, confidently using her otherness to forge her own path. In an exclusive interview, she opens up about becoming the first black woman to lead and create an LVMH luxury line, Fenty, as well as the future of fashion and her next album. Middle East peace plan: President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have announced that the U.S. will hold an “economic workshop” in Bahrain next month, hoping that investment and financial incentives will encourage the Palestinians and other Arabs to resolve the conflict with Israel. ISIS: Three guards and 29 inmates were killed after violence involving the Islamic State broke out at a high-security prison in Tajikistan, the country’s Justice Ministry said. The Philippines: President Rodrigo Duterte has gone a week without appearing in public, igniting speculation that he could be seriously ill and in hospital. Japan: The country’s economy surprisingly grew by 2.1 percent in the first quarter, despite weakened demand from China, but domestic consumption and exports fell, signaling underlying weaknesses. Indonesia: The country’s election commission confirmed that President Joko Widodo succeeded in his bid for re-election, beating a former army general with connections to hard-line Islamists. The election was a repudiation of nationalist and faith politics that have brought strongmen to power around the world. Amazon: Shareholders are expected to vote on two proposals this week aimed at restricting sales of Amazon’s facial recognition software to government agencies and investigating the extent to which the product might threaten civil, human and privacy rights. France: After years of court battles, a 42-year-old man, who spent more than a decade in a vegetative state after a car accident, was taken off life support and was being given heavy doses of sedation, in keeping with the country’s acceptance of “passive euthanasia.” Snapshot: Above, a man in black scaled the Eiffel Tower in Paris, prompting officials to evacuate and close the landmark. The climber has not been identified and it’s unclear why he climbed the tower. Gay athlete: Dutee Chand, a champion sprinter, has become India’s first openly gay professional athlete, less than a year after the country’s top court overturned a longstanding ban on gay sex. ‘Game of Thrones’: After eight long seasons, the game is over with a finale that our critic thought was “a mishmash of poignant moments and puzzling turns.” What we’re reading: This BuzzFeed News investigation into Tony Robbins. “Jane Bradley and Katie J.M. Baker totally blew me away with their yearlong investigation,” says our magazine writer Taffy Brodesser-Akner. “This is so rigorous. I hope they feel like it’s worth it from beneath the mound of lawyer letters it probably launched.” Cook: Try replacing the meat with cauliflower in chicken adobo, a sweet-and-sour classic of Filipino cooking. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.) Watch: Recent movie trailers like “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” and “Always Be My Maybe” seem to have something for everyone. Listen: Slipknot remains a wildly popular cult act, and the band has released new music: “Unsainted” is the lead single from “We Are Not Your Kind,” which will be released in August. Go: Like so many good ideas, the Every Woman Biennial was born out of a joke. Now it’s in its third edition, displaying the work of over 600 female and nonbinary artists in New York, with a pop-up coming in Los Angeles. Smarter Living: People want more of what they think is scarce. That’s a truism backed up by research — and you can use it to increase your own professional appeal. Don’t be too readily available for projects or offers, to avoid conveying that you’re in low demand. Holding your eagerness in check can show confidence. Trust in your self-worth, and try an “abundance” mind-set, meaning that if a particular offer doesn’t work out, something better will be around the corner. And we’ve compiled a few pointers for shopping for outdoor accent tables. Tonight in London, the winner of this year’s Man Booker International Prize, the world’s most significant award for translated fiction, will be announced. It is worth 50,000 British pounds, or about $64,000, split equally between author and translator, making it one of the few book prizes that puts the art of translating on the same level as writing itself. This year’s shortlist is dominated by women. Five of the six authors and all of the translators are female. Jen Calleja, whose translation of Marion Poschmann’s “The Pine Islands” from German is shortlisted, said in a telephone interview that translating had historically been seen as an administrative task, so as women’s work. But she said awards like tonight’s had helped change that, bringing awareness to the skill involved. “There are hundreds of considerations that go into each page,” she said, pointing out that each word choice impacts the emotion of a novel. “I write too,” she said, “but translating is my big passion. It’s a real puzzle.” That’s it for this briefing. See you next time. — Alisha Thank youTo Mark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford and Kenneth R. Rosen for the break from the news.

2019,Your Tuesday Briefing,"Good morning, We’re covering China’s response to U.S. tariffs, a curfew in Sri Lanka and a journey through ancient Greek mythology. The country’s finance ministry announced that it would increase duties on a wide range of American goods to 20 or 25 percent from 10 percent on June 1. The news rippled through Wall Street, which had its worst day since the beginning of the year, as investors digested the prospect that the trade war could persist. Takeaway: While China’s decision intensifies the ongoing trade war, delaying implementation leaves room to reach a deal that could end the standoff. The move mirrors the Trump administration’s increased tariffs on Chinese goods. Those won’t bite immediately, either: they will apply to shipments that left China on Friday, which typically take two to four weeks by sea to reach the U.S. Bigger picture: The question now is whether the U.S. and China can reach a deal this time. Negotiators have met 11 times, with both sides asserting that a deal was close, only for talks to fall apart at the last minute. The country declared a nationwide curfew from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. in an attempt to curb violence after attacks against the minority Muslim population. Tensions have been high in the weeks since the deadly Easter Sunday bombings, claimed by the Islamic State. The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka said attacks had been reported in at least five towns in the North Western province. On Monday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe deployed security forces in the province to control the situation. “People are so afraid that they are fleeing their homes and hiding in paddy fields with small children,” said the president of the Muslim Council. Context: Sectarian violence has a long history in Sri Lanka. In 1983, mobs of Sinhalese, the ethnic majority, angered by attacks by the separatist Tamil Tigers, burned down Tamil shops and houses, killing anywhere between 400 and 3,000 people. The Swedish authorities announced that they would reopen an investigation into a rape allegation against the WikiLeaks founder, adding a layer of complication to the cases he is tangled in. This investigation stems from an accusation in 2010 by a Swedish woman that was dropped after Mr. Assange fled to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. He was removed from the embassy last month and promptly arrested for jumping bail. Reminder: The U.S. is still seeking Mr. Assange’s extradition over accusations that he had tried to assist in a massive breach of classified information, primarily about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even without the rape investigation, extraditing him to the U.S. was bound to be a long and complicated process that could take years. What’s next: British officials will have to decide which of the two cases takes precedence. If he is extradited to Sweden to face the rape allegations, he can’t be sent to the U.S. without permission from Britain, Swedish prosecutors said. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said two of its oil tankers sustained “significant damage” near the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian Gulf. A Norwegian company said one of its tankers was also damaged. Neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates assigned blame, and the nature of the sabotage was still unclear. But the news raised fears of escalating tensions with Iran. In recent years, Iran has threatened to block traffic in the strait in response to Western sanctions but has not followed through. Context: The news came after the Trump administration deployed aircraft carriers and bombers to the gulf to counter what it says is the possibility of increased aggression from Iran. The pressure tactics are aimed at forcing political change in Iran. On the ground: Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said that U.S. sanctions had ruined the country’s economy as much as the devastating Iran-Iraq war had in the 1980s, a remarkable comparison that hints at the seriousness of the situation. But he also signaled that Iran had no intention of bowing to pressure. In Britain, the government’s decade-long austerity program has rippled through every aspect of life, resulting in the closing of tiny community centers and the elimination of bus routes. For many retired people, those small changes can profoundly upend their lives — particularly in Cumbria, one of the poorest rural areas in England. Sudan: The country’s former president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, has been charged in connection with the deaths of protesters who died in demonstrations last month that led to his ouster, the nation’s public prosecutor said. The military council said it has been holding Mr. al-Bashir at a prison in the capital city of Khartoum. Apple: The U.S. Supreme Court allowed an antitrust case against the technology giant to move forward. The case, in which plaintiffs argue that the company used its monopoly power to raise app prices, is in its early stages, but the damages claimed could be significant. Afghanistan: A Taliban attack on two aid groups last week that killed 13 people is an ominous signal that, as peace talks falter, the insurgents are targeting so-called soft targets. Australia: In the week before general elections, we’ll bring you a daily snapshot of voters from across the country and of what they care about. In our first installment, we speak to an Indigenous elder who wants to limit immigration and a farmer who doesn’t believe in climate change. Ireland: An American pastor, who has been accused of anti-Semitic and homophobic hate speech, was barred from entering the country. It was the first use of a 1999 law that allows the government to exclude people for national security or public policy reasons. The moon: A new study suggests that shallow moonquakes are caused by a combination of escaping internal heat and the Earth’s gravitational pull, prompting questions about the moon’s evolution. Snapshot: Above, Dexa Beach on Ithaca, Greece. One writer chronicled his voyage to the island, once thought to be the home of Odysseus as told in Homer’s epic eighth-century B.C. poem “The Odyssey.” What we’re reading: This article in The Washingtonian. “This look at how high-end Washington restaurants treat their VIP customers really drove home a central truth of fine dining,” says Michael Gold, a metro reporter: “The people you might expect to say ‘don't you know who I am?’ to get a table really don't need to.” Cook: This take on a Niçoise salad turns the recipe into an elegant sheet-pan dinner with roasted mustard-glazed salmon in place of tuna. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.) Watch: The penultimate episode of “Game of Thrones” episode was “horrifyingly dazzling” but “ultimately frustrating,” writes our TV critic (spoilers ahead). Listen: Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber’s new collaboration, “I Don’t Care,” is a tale of insecurity at a party that somehow turns into romance. Read: “Boy Swallows Universe,” by Trent Dalton, a celebrated Australian journalist, is a thrilling coming-of-age novel based on his unusual childhood. Smarter Living: Maintaining relationships is like earning compound interest: We make investments through our words and actions, and over time our relationships blossom. Shared experiences with our loved ones are what get us through the other parts of our lives. So today, check in with an old friend, text someone a meme or even take a minute to say an overdue thank you. It could brighten both of your days. When you want to shut everything out, there are many pros and cons to noise-cancelling headphones. Around the world, limits are being imposed on plastics, which break into particles that end up permeating the oceans, the air, the earth and even our bodies. One common target is the drinking straw. In the U.S. alone, hundreds of millions are used daily. Seattle has banned them. In Los Angeles, if you want a straw, you have to ask for it. Hipster bars all over are switching to paper. But humans and straws go way back. The Sumerian civilization (4,000 B.C.) in southern Mesopotamia used hollow reeds or golden tubes to sip beer, bypassing gunk left from fermentation. In 19th-century America, an inventor, Marvin Stone, wrapped paper strips around a pencil, glued and waxed them, and patented his creation in 1888. Forty years later, another inventor, Joseph Friedman, put a screw in a straw. Wrapping floss around the screw’s thread created small ridges that made the straw bendable, which proved helpful for hospital patients when drinking from cups. Only since the polymer boom of the 1960s have straws been predominantly made of plastic. That’s it for this briefing.

2019,Youth’s Video Takes Aim at Merkel’s Party in Run-Up to European Elections,"BERLIN — For years, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been fighting to expand the digital skills of the nation’s work force and to get more youths engaged in politics. This past week, a young, blue-haired German YouTuber known as Rezo showed how unsettling the right combination of digital savvy and political engagement could be to the establishment. In a slick 55-minute clip, complete with a list of 247 references and citations of scientific literature, he attacked Ms. Merkel’s governing Christian Democratic Union for a range of sins: growing social inequality, pollution, war and internet censorship. As of Saturday morning, the YouTube video had been viewed more than nine million times, making it Germany’s most popular nonmusical clip in six days. [Follow our coverage of European election results.] The video has led to a storm of debate in a country that is just starting to come to terms with the outsize effect that independent journalists and activists on social media can have on the public discourse. The clip also became a public relations crisis for the governing conservatives just days before Germans headed to the polls on Sunday for the European Parliament elections. “It’s upending the familiar order of knowledge: What are facts and what isn’t? What are the most important voices?” said Andreas Dörner, a professor of media studies at the Philipps-University Marburg. “It’s both fascinating and scary,” Professor Dörner added. The video is a master class in online civic engagement. Clad in an orange hoodie and gray baseball cap, the narrator, who says he is 26, unfurls his attack point by point, apparently while sitting in his workroom study with guitars and keyboards in the background. His real identity and hometown are unclear, but he says he is a YouTube music producer. The video employs easy-to-watch cuts, sound effects and graphs and, in a style commensurate with German youth culture, uses much English slang. “In this video, I’ll show how C.D.U. people lie, how they are lacking fundamental competencies for their jobs, how they make politics that runs counter to expert opinion, they apparently take part in various war crimes, how they use propaganda and lies against the younger generation, how because of their politics of the last decades the rich become richer and the poor and others increasingly lose,” he says at the start of the video. “And I’ll show that according to many thousands of German scientists, the C.D.U. is currently destroying our very lives and our future.” As the number of views on the video rose, the reactions from politicians whose party was attacked changed from dismissive to angry. On Thursday, Ms. Merkel’s party published an open letter addressing each of Rezo’s main lines of attack. It then announced that it had filmed its own video in response, using the youngest member of Parliament, Philipp Amthor, but decided against publishing it. “This very public accounting puts the traditional parties on Defcon 3,” Professor Dörner said. Instead, Paul Ziemiak, the head of the Young Union, the party’s youth wing, called out Rezo on Twitter for a one-on-one debate. “We take it very seriously, especially because so many young people are watching the video,” Mr. Ziemiak told German reporters. Since then, other young politicians, including the Christian Democrats’ Jenna Behrends, who is involved in Berlin city politics, and Tiemo Wölken, a Social Democratic Party member of the European Parliament, have responded with their own videos. But none of the responses have garnered the interest that the initial video did. The national fascination with the video comes from the recognition that the authority structures in the country are being upended in real time, Professor Dörner said in the interview. German households pay a media fee of almost $20 a month directly to public broadcasters, whether they own a television or not. In return, the public broadcasters are trusted to be a bedrock of quality journalism and worthwhile entertainment. But Germans are increasingly getting their news and entertainment from nontraditional sources on the internet. A recent analysis by the news organization BuzzFeed showed that of the 100 most-shared social media posts mentioning the European elections in German, 49 came from the populist Alternative for Germany and 13 others from the Freedom Party, Austria’s far-right party whose leader recently resigned as vice chancellor over a video that raised questions over ties to Russia. Legacy news broadcasters accounted for seven of the 100 most shared. The Christian Democrats, who have run the country for 13 years and are poised to win the most seats in the European Parliament of any Germany party, did not even place. While Rezo’s video, titled “The Destruction of the C.D.U.,” attacks the party directly, he doesn’t shy away from criticizing the Social Democrats, who have been in the governing coalition for nine of the past 13 years. And at one point he calls Alternative for Germany members Nazis. Because the clip appeals to young people, who in the past have not voted, its effects have not been obvious in the newest opinion polls, where the Christian Union (made up of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratics and their Bavaria-only sister party, the Christian Social Union) still leads the German parties with roughly 27 percent of the vote. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a conservative-leaning news daily, published an op-ed article targeting Rezo under the headline “Every ‘like’ an indictment of shame.” Dozens of other articles have either criticized and praised the video blogger, and some have dissected his arguments one by one, the way American news media outlets fact-check claims made by presidential candidates. In the ensuing storm, Rezo stayed quiet. Then, on Friday, he and 90 other YouTubers — many with significant followers in Germany — put out a video calling on viewers to go out and vote, but not for the Christian Democrats or the Social Democrats.",The New York Times

Then, on Friday, he and 90 other YouTubers — many with significant followers in Germany — put out a video calling on viewers to go out and vote, but not for the Christian Democrats or the Social Democrats.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | You’re Not Alone When You’re on Google,"We know that. But the “privacy paradox” means we still act like we are. Opinion Columnist At first blush, it seems safe to say that most of us harbor inconsistent — if not neurotically contradictory — notions about our personal privacy. We claim to treasure it, yet want badly to be known and seen (posting on Instagram, preening on Twitter). We’re spooked when the same set of advertisements tailgate us, yet become furious when our iPhones have no clue where we are when we search for a restaurant (Hello, I am NOT in Fort Wayne). We loathe that our data is mined and scraped, yet still we opt for Google over DuckDuckGo (never mind that Google is tracking our moves like an assassin); still we use Facebook (never mind that it harvests our personal information like so many internal organs); and we click “I agree” when downloading our apps, knowing full well that those apps are talking to other apps, telling them how much we eat and what music we listen to and when we ovulate. Plus: Has it made one whit of difference that we’re now alerted to the use of cookies on websites, thanks to that recent rule issued by the European Union? Speaking for myself, I would say it has not. Those alerts make me feel worse, because they reveal my impatience, my recklessness, my everyday failures of self-regulation. I seem to be forever surrendering my privacy in exchange for some short-term gain, rather than dutifully slogging through the decision tree of the cookie opt-out. So the question becomes: Why do I — why do many of us — consistently act in ways that are directly at loggerheads with the privacy values we profess to hold dear? What explains this phenomenon, which experts have taken to calling “the privacy paradox”? In an attempt at reconciliation — and expiation and clarification — I made lots of phone calls and did lots of reading on the topic in recent weeks, much of it online. By the end, I was Google-stalked almost exclusively by ads about privacy-related books and podcasts: I was that deep in a house of meta-horrors. Here, perhaps, was my most liberating discovery: Our conflicting impulses are actually quite rational. As Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology at Carnegie Mellon, points out, sometimes each of the contradictory beliefs in a paradox is perfectly well founded. Let’s consider, just as an example, why we are forever skating past the internet’s fine print. In 2008 — 2008! before Instagram, before Uber, before WhatsApp! — two of Acquisti’s colleagues at Carnegie Mellon calculated just how long it would take for the average internet user to read the privacy policies of all the websites he or she visited in a single year. Their answer: over 30 workdays, at a national opportunity cost of $781 billion. Which makes blowing off those policies seem quite reasonable. A necessity, even. So there you have one explanation for this so-called paradox: To fully apprehend our vulnerabilities as digital creatures would require far too much time and energy. More than that: It would require an entirely new set of instincts, a radically different cognitive framework from the one we now possess. Joyce Searls, a privacy activist and consultant in Santa Barbara, Calif., is forever reminding people that we’ve barely begun to understand who and what we are on the internet, in part because it’s a disembodied experience. We think we’re alone while we’re buzzing through the mists of cyberspace — that a Google search is akin to thumbing through the Yellow Pages, because it feels just as solitary. But it isn’t. We are being watched, tracked; we simply don’t realize it, because we can’t see it or feel it. Which suggests another reason we’re less than conscientious about our online habits: Most of us haven’t paid a humiliating price for being watched and tracked. “We’ve had a massive experience of walking around naked with no perceived consequences,” says Searls. Why bother getting dressed? So we carry on. Even though everyone is mutely collecting our queries, preferences, fetishes, anxieties. Google. Amazon. Facebook. YouTube. Pandora. Pinterest. The Weather Channel. Reddit. Wikipedia. Major League Baseball. PornHub. Zillow. Your newspaper. Your bank. Your phone carrier. Everyone. Danah Boyd, the founder of the Data & Society Research Institute, perhaps put it best when she wrote we are “public by default, private through effort.” For most people, that effort — to change how they search, how they buy stuff, how they connect with others and absorb news — is just too great. “There’s a sense that the fight to protect your data is unwinnable,” says Acquisti, of Carnegie Mellon. “You’d have to learn about other tools, it’s costly in time, and it might not even help, because your data is already out there.” Resignation also explains the privacy paradox. It’s a perfectly rational response to a situation in which human beings have very little agency. If that’s the case, my initial instinct — to call our privacy habits “neurotically contradictory” — is a rather ungenerous one. “It’s not a neurotic contradiction,” Shoshana Zuboff, a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, says to me in the nicest possible way. “It’s an intolerable contradiction.” Zuboff is the author of “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” an ambitious fright-opus that examines the new corporate trafficking in human habits and the consequences for our society. She thinks it’s absurd, not to mention blaming the victim, to say that we’re reckless with our privacy online. Rather, she argues, we have no choice. Online is where our individual needs get met, because they aren’t being met in real life. “The real institutional world has abandoned us,” she tells me. As she notes: We call the airlines — or our insurance companies or our banks — and spend ten minutes talking to robots, then another 15 on hold, waiting to speak to an actual person. Is it any wonder we handle matters concerning our health, travel, and banking online instead? Zuboff has equal compassion for our promiscuities on social media, as compromising as they may be to our privacy. Status online has become compensation for living in an environment of economic instability. It may even pay economic dividends. Influencers online can make money. (Two words that turn my blood to ice: Instagram celebrity.) What many of us don’t realize, when we’re online, is how very much the technologies we’re using are reshaping our ideas about privacy without our notice. Which in turn reshapes our behaviors. This is one of the core themes of “Re-Engineering Humanity,” by Brett Frischmann and Evan Selinger. It’s not an accident, they argue, that we treat our privacy differently now. The tools we use have been designed with exactly this end in mind. I think, in my own life, about the first random person whose friend request I accepted on Facebook. I no longer remember his name. I simply remember realizing that he was not, as best as I could discern, a friend of a good friend, but rather had come my way via a loopity skein of loose ties. Still, I clicked “accept.” Before I knew it, I was doing this pretty regularly, especially in 2014, when I had a book to sell. (Status! Visibility! Sales!) And all was fine with this freewheeling system until the day that one of those random people — someone who’d requested my friendship, not the other way around (it was never the other way around) — wrote me a nasty note on Facebook Messenger, letting me know he’d seen me on television and thought me a perfect idiot. I unfriended him. But I also felt unnerved and rather furious with myself: He had, at that point, presumably seen pictures of my kid, my wedding at City Hall, my 25th high school reunion. How had I decided that such a thing was … fine? “The danger that ‘privacy’ doesn’t capture is this idea of creep,” says Frischmann, an internet law expert at Villanova University. Like letting that random person into your Facebook circle, or — and this happened in Frischmann’s own life — seeing your child come home from school with a fitness tracking device, which may seem like a win-win (you get free tech; the child might learn about healthy habits) until you consider what it means. “You’re conditioning a generation of kids to accept bodily surveillance by others without question,” he says. Our uses of big tech are not only based on our own desires, but the desires of those who designed it. There’s a frightening automaticity to them. (I accept. Click.) It’s as if we’re the robots. The irony — or maybe it isn’t? — is that the demographic most susceptible to the influence of these technologies may also be the savviest about privacy. It was Danah Boyd who set me straight about this. Her book, “It’s Complicated,” makes it clear that teenagers care deeply about their privacy. The difference is how they go about maintaining it. Some, for instance, just post everything. “They obfuscate,” she explains, “through flooding.” They know that our minds are inefficient threshers, slow and lousy at separating wheat from chaff. But if you tell everyone everything, no one knows where to look or what matters. There is, of course, someone else in American life who regularly floods the zone, namely with his Twitter feed. He, too, has been able to divert and confound through this deceptively simple means. According to a recent Gallup poll, his approval rating is now at 46 percent. Nearly half of Americans don’t think he’s naked at all. They still think, against all odds, that the emperor is wearing clothes.

2019,You’ve Conquered the Escape Room. But Can You Escape the Lab?,"A physicist at the University of Illinois devised an immersive game in which teams solve science puzzles to unlock a mystery — before it’s too late. URBANA, Ill. — It was 10 p.m., and we were locked in a room at the mall. It had been a long day. I had woken up at 5 that morning to finish writing an article. Then I had spent a day talking to University of Illinois students and professors. The physics department had invited me and two other science writers to visit, part of an effort to help science and engineering students better explain what they do. I had had a few glasses of wine at dinner. And now here I was in a locked room at Lincoln Square Mall, straining to recall my ancient physics education in order to get out. The four of us — me plus Phillip Schewe, a longtime science writer; David Ehrenstein, an editor at the American Physical Society; and Karin Dahmen, a physics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign — had an hour to figure out everything about a missing scientist. The fate of the free world was at stake. Of course. This video laid out our mission. Such “escape rooms” have become popular in recent years — immersive games where you and your friends (or strangers) search for clues and solve puzzles to defuse a simulated danger before time runs out. Paul Kwiat, another University of Illinois physicist, is the creator of this particular escape room, which is one of the few, perhaps the only one, filled with puzzles that are based on science. “Science can be fun,” he said. “Normally, people don’t include science and fun in the same sentence.” Four years ago, Dr. Kwiat, who studies how to harness the properties of light for future quantum computers and encrypted communications, was attending a conference in Switzerland. He looked online for something fun to do in the off hours. The destination with the highest rating on TripAdvisor was not a hiking trail or something historical or cultural, but an escape room. He and a colleague went. Neither had been in, or out of, an escape room before. “It was superfun,” said Dr. Kwiat, even though they were unable to solve all of the Sherlock Holmes-themed puzzles in the allotted time. On the same trip, he did another escape room, in Prague. (He’s now done 25.) He thought that someone ought to devise an escape room with science puzzles, and when the American Physical Society put out a call for “innovative outreach,” he started working on one himself. For his girlfriend’s birthday, Dr. Kwiat put together a small test version. In the spring semester, he recruited undergraduates in a class he was teaching to refine the puzzles and build more rugged copies of them. He leased space in the mall, a former baby goods store. He put together a story: The fictional Professor Alberta Schrödenberg has made a breakthrough in quantum computing while working for a government agency, the Disruptive Technology Office. But she was worried that enemy agents were closing in to steal her discovery. Then she disappeared, leaving behind a secret laboratory with mysteries to be solved. “For me, the best escape rooms are the ones with a good story line,” Dr. Kwiat said. “There’s a good reason you’re locked in a room, and there’s a good reason why there are puzzles, and there’s even a good reason why there are people giving you hints to those puzzles.” In January 2017, LabEscape opened. (The $10,000 grant from the American Physical Society arrived four months later.) Some 4,700 people have now passed through. Dr. Kwiat has created a sequel scenario as well as a transportable prequel that he has taken to physics conferences. Before entering, we were given several sheets describing some basic properties of light. We skimmed over information about different wavelengths of light, including radio waves and X-rays, and the law of refraction describing how light bends when entering a material like water or glass. Dr. Kwiat said that it was not essential to memorize all of that knowledge, but good to look over and keep in mind. Into the room we went. As it turned out, a background in physics does not necessarily help. I’m a former graduate student who left Illinois a quarter century ago without my doctorate after deciding I was better at asking other scientists what the answer was. Both David Ehrenstein and Phil Schewe finished Ph.D.s before also deciding they preferred the communications side of physics. And Karin Dahmen is a working physics professor. But we lacked traits of accomplished escape room devotees. That included methodical organization — take an inventory of everything in the room — and focus. Communicate clearly with your teammates; don’t get distracted. Dr. Schewe, for example, started browsing a stack of old Physics Today magazines in a bookcase. “Phil!” I said, exasperated. “Stop looking for your articles!” (Tip: Do not squander time reading the magazines. But you may want to take a careful look around there.) In devising LabEscape, Dr. Kwiat came up with sleights-of-vision that seem like computer- generated special effects but instead manipulate phenomena of real materials. To avoid spoiling the puzzles for future lab escapees, consider instead a plastic tank that once hung in LabEscape’s welcome area. There, Dr. Kwiat took advantage of the optical alchemy of acrylic and corn syrup. At first look, the tank was clear and seemingly empty. But put on a pair of 3-D IMAX glasses, and three-dimensional letters spelling LabEscape, fringed in psychedelic colors, suddenly appeared before you. The tank was not empty, but filled with 18 gallons of corn syrup. The letters, made of acrylic, were also in there. But because the two materials possess roughly the same index of refraction, light passed from one through the other without bending, and the letters were almost invisible. But corn syrup is also what scientists call “optically active,” because of the shape of its sugar molecules. Polarized light — where the oscillating electric fields of the photons are lined up in parallel, like airplanes flying in formation — was directed into the tank. As the light passed through the syrup, the polarization rotated. (Think of the planes doing barrel rolls in synchrony.) Blue light rotates about twice as much as red light. Because acrylic is not optically active, the rays that passed through the letters — and traveled through less of the syrup — had a different orientation. Your eyes do not perceive polarization, but a polarizing filter in the IMAX glasses turned the invisible colorfully visible. The sign is no longer there, because Dr. Kwiat overlooked another basic property of corn syrup — it’s denser than water. Under the strain of the extra weight, the plastic ruptured, unleashing a sticky deluge. The escape room has been a learning experience for Dr. Kwiat in other ways. One puzzle involves extracting a key to open a lock to get to another clue. Dr. Kwiat designed the solution, but was surprised when a participant figured out an alternative way of getting the key. Then someone figured out a third way, and someone else figured out a fourth way. Eventually, he stopped being surprised. Now, escape room players have come up with 18 different ways of fishing out the key. A debriefing after you finish your time locked in the room yields some fascinating tidbits. Did you know your digital camera can capture infrared light that your eyes cannot see? I didn’t. And there really was a federal agency called the Disruptive Technology Office. Dr. Kwiat even got a grant from it. But he isn’t expecting people to emerge educated about the index of refraction or how a laser works. Instead, Dr. Kwiat hopes participants will better appreciate how scientists find beauty and awe in deciphering the universe. “There’s a great sense of triumph when you overcome one of these puzzles,” he said. “Just as in science.” Erica Phillpott, a receptionist at a fitness club, took her six children, ages ranging from 10 to 19, into LabEscape. At first, as she was looking at the sheets of science information, she was nervous. “I just paid this man to add extra stress to my life,” she recalled thinking. “None of us really knows anything about science.” But Ms. Phillpott and her children made it out of the room. “We saved the world,” she said. Afterward, her 12-year-old daughter, whose birthday they were celebrating, got more excited about science. She now thinks she would like to study forensics or something similar. “She really got the most out of it,” Ms. Phillpott said. Even with the turnover of students at the university, there probably are not enough customers to keep LabEscape in business in Urbana indefinitely. Dr. Kwiat envisions moving it to a science museum in a larger city and hopes that a company investing in quantum computing research — Google, perhaps, he said wistfully — might sponsor it. The goal would not be to get people at a science museum to try an escape room, but the reverse: to entice escape room aficionados to visit a science museum. As for the three science writers and the physicist, we, um, did not solve all of the problems and, when our time ran out, were banished to the “quantum realm.” But it was fun way to end the day.",The New York Times
2019,You’ve Seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead Onscreen. Get Ready for Her Onstage.,"A Word With Chances are you have seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Maybe it was as the ultracool delivery girl of Michael Cera’s dreams in “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” the resolute survivor of the sci-fi/horror thriller “10 Cloverfield Lane” or the swaggering ex-con Nikki Swango in the third season of “Fargo.” Fans of indie fare may also remember Ms. Winstead’s un-showy honesty as a recovering alcoholic and elementary schoolteacher in the drama “Smashed,” opposite Aaron Paul. And yet the actress somehow still sidesteps the brightest spotlights, which may have something to do with the unassuming manner in which she carries her beauty — and the lack of ostentatious awards-bait roles in her filmography. “Some people do want bigger and flashier, and don’t really get it when you don’t go there,” said Ms. Winstead, 34. “I’ve always had to just be sort of O.K. with being under the radar if people don’t necessarily respond to that kind of performance, because that’s what makes me feel good.” And she continues to branch out. She made an album of swoony pop songs with the producer Dan the Automator (not under her own name, but as Got a Girl) in 2014. And now Ms. Winstead is testing herself anew: She is co-starring in a revival of “Dying City,” Christopher Shinn’s subtly suspenseful drama of grief and manipulation, that runs at Second Stage Theater until June 30. “I was too scared to go after it,” Ms. Winstead said of stage acting. “I didn’t go to theater school or anything, so it’s always been something I thought I wouldn’t know how to do. But now I’ve reached a place where that really excites me.” After that, the actress will be back on the big screen in less cozy settings: She’s in the Will Smith action movie “Gemini Man,” out in October, and is playing the vigilante Huntress alongside Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn in the 2020 release “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).” Ms. Winstead recently sat down for a chat in a rehearsal room at Second Stage. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What made you change your mind about doing a play? I did this PBS show called “Mercy Street” with a cast of theater actors. I came at it with an inferiority complex but they really encouraged me to try. At that point I thought I could do the Williamstown Theater Festival or something, dip my toes in. Then the script [for “Dying City”] came when I had been doing “Gemini Man” and “Birds of Prey,” back-to-back, wall-to-wall action movies — which was really fun, but I was starting to crave something intimate and personal. I thought, “That’s it, that’s what I have to do. I need something new to challenge myself.” It was sort of a no-brainer so I auditioned. I think they were already interested in me but I didn’t realize it and I was like, “Please, let me have this part!” [laughs]. Did doing live shows with Got a Girl help alleviate your jitters? I remember thinking, “It’s just me on that stage, there’s no spectacle, what am I supposed to do? There’s no way I’ll be able to command these people’s attention.” It was surprising to be so scared then step on stage and feel totally relaxed and confident. Having had that experience was one step closer to going, “I think I can do a play.” It’s not your stage debut, though: Didn’t you do “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” in Salt Lake City with Donny Osmond? Ha! I was 13. If you’ve seen that show, you know there’s a choir of children who sit onstage all the time and sing occasionally — I was in that. It was an incredible experience for me as a little kid but I didn’t continue down the path of theater and around that age I started working in TV and film. Your IMDb page is getting pretty long. Which projects were keystones? Definitely “Smashed” was a huge one for me. I unlocked something that made me go, “O.K., I understand myself a little bit more, and I understand how I’m going to be able to bring that to the role I play.” It brought a new level of confidence in terms of being able to connect with all kinds of characters — they didn’t have to be like me in order for me to bring them fully to life. In “Fargo,” Nikki struts around as if she were always in control. Was it as fun to play her as it looks? I loved [the role] but I was like, “Me? Really? This is what you want me to play?” I was a little bit perplexed because I was expecting some sort of Minnesota-nice character. I guess I was surprised that I would be playing someone so brash and tough and sexy and ballsy — all of those things I never attributed to myself. Usually there tends to be some sort of sweetness in what I’m offered, or bookishness. But I love it when I’m offered something in the opposite direction. “Gemini Man” is a big action thriller. Did you get to hang from a helicopter? That seems to happen a lot in this type of film. No, but I do a lot of running around and I get to fight some people. I had to train in jiu jitsu, do a little tactical gun training — there’s some shootouts. “Birds of Prey” was the next level up. In “Gemini Man” I’m a D.I.A. [Defense Intelligence Agency] agent who’s been hired to keep an eye on Will Smith, but in “Birds of Prey” I play this assassin who’s been trained since childhood. It’s all women and genuinely funny and weird. It feels from the ’90s, in the best way.",The New York Times
2019,Yvonne Strahovski Reveals Her Monstrous Side,"Watching “The Handmaid’s Tale” can be harrowing enough, so what’s it like to play a linchpin of Gilead with a baby in your trailer? From the start, “The Handmaid’s Tale” — the Hulu series spun from Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel about a brutal patriarchy and the women who serve it — seemed destined to be a star vehicle for Elisabeth Moss. Her perspective. Her interior monologue. Her face. Then Yvonne Strahovski transformed into a monster. “No! No, I didn’t realize but it’s very exciting,” Strahovski exclaimed, sounding as surprised as anyone about the turn her character — Serena Joy Waterford, the Commander’s inscrutable wife — took once Moss’s handmaid, June, became pregnant in the second season. Her resulting tour de force leveled the playing field between Moss and Strahovski, who notched Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for best supporting actress. “I’ve always wanted to be an actress, even as a little girl in Australia,” she said. “I remember thinking how cool it would be to play and act and then maybe win an award for it one day.” Season 2 ended with a moment of clarity as Serena rescued her daughter from the savagery she helped create by having her smuggled to Canada. As the third season begins, Strahovski reaffirms her skill as a formidable sparring partner in scenes that shatter the show’s paradigm, transforming Serena into a potential ally to June. Lithe and radiant, Strahovski — who’d previously played a killer and love interest in “Dexter,” and a C.I.A. agent and love interest in “Chuck” — wasn’t the obvious choice for the frail, but hardened Serena as Atwood wrote her. But Strahovski pursued the role anyway and endured a two-month wait as the show’s producers decided who they wanted their Serena to be, finally settling on a version that was more of June’s equal. “It’s an interesting choice for them to go much younger,” she said. “It really ups the drama and the tension between the two women, especially on the subject of fertility, and one being so envious of the other.” It also upped the personal drama — and led to a thousand “Blessed be the fruit” jokes — for Strahovski, who shot Season 2 while pregnant and Season 3 just weeks after giving birth to a son with her husband, the actor Tim Loden. In a chat over hot tea at an Upper West Side diner, Strahovski, 36 and raised in Sydney, spoke about the perils of playing Serena and what scares her the most. Not up for discussion: her latest role — only recently announced and still under wraps — in “Stateless,” a new six-part series about four strangers in an Australian immigration detention center produced by and starring Cate Blanchett. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. There will be no spoilers here. But early on in Season 3, I found myself really rooting for Serena. And then … She has that look in her eyes. [Laughs] I think that’s the fun of watching a character like Serena. You root for her so much and she does something so good, and then just like that you can be like, Aww, nooo. Serena is riding the Kingda Ka of emotions this season after giving her baby away. I was so struck by how overcome with regret Serena would have been, because we pick up right after she gave the baby away. You’d be so upset and in such a low spot, considering that baby was the only thing she ever wanted and the only thing she looked forward to. So to have that one thing taken away from you just would be totally devastating. And yet the grieving Serena still can’t quite fathom June’s own pain at having had one child stolen from her and then being forced to relinquish another. I think she does understand it to a point but she thinks that her circumstances and position in Gilead trump June’s. More, “This is how it goes in Gilead and you are my handmaid and will make me my baby — and that’s what we all signed up for, supposedly voluntarily, right?” But I also think that Serena in her own brain has been through a lot and can’t see beyond her own trauma and her own emotion into someone else’s trauma and emotion — because it’s all pretty horrendous. So I don’t know that she necessarily thinks June is worse off than she is. How did you approach such harrowing scenes with your infant son back in your trailer? I came to work with a six- or seven-week-old. It was insane. I remember shooting really long days and running back and forth from set to the trailer and breast-feeding — shoot a scene, change the camera setup, run back to the trailer, feed, shoot more of the scene and come back, shoot more of the scene and come back. It was such a Jekyll-and-Hyde moment because Serena is so miserable and depressed when we first come into this season. And then I’m going back to the trailer and looking at my son, and he’s so cute and smiley and brings me so much joy. You keep referring to Serena as a terrible person, even as I’m thinking she’s maybe not actually all evil. Really? Yeah, I do feel she is … she’s a pretty terrible person. [Laughs] Does playing her affect the way people perceive you or the roles you’re offered? I do hear a lot from makeup artists and people that I work with. They’ll say, “My friend is asking, ‘Is she a bitch to work with?’” That’s pretty funny. I guess if you don’t know me you would wonder what the person was like in real life. I don’t think I’m much like her. Do you personally hope that Serena starts wielding more political power? I mean … [pause] that’s a really interesting question. I think what’s funny is when people — and me, also — would like to see Serena come good and lead that female resistance and turn her back on Gilead, but is that interesting to watch? I mean no, maybe not so much. How do you and Elisabeth endure such grim story lines day after day? Everyone is pretty goofy on set. I know that sounds weird that we have fun on set but we do. It’s a dream come true to be able to play June and Serena. These super powerhouse female roles are layered and complex, and the story lines are amazing, and it’s so fun as an actor to come to work and play with that. It has been rumored that you sing Taylor Swift songs between scenes. We do, we do. We have a bit of an obsession going on. And presumably she watches the show. On the Golden Globes, she made a video message for Elisabeth. Just very exciting. [Laughs] You’re a Sierra Club ambassador who has car-camped your way through national parks and public lands. You’re also a surfer. So you’re essentially fearless? I’m terrified of running into a bear. Everyone in the States always thinks that I’m crazy — that we have all the deadly snakes and spiders in Australia, which we do. But wouldn’t you rather get bitten by one of those than eaten alive by a bear?",The New York Times
2019,Zen and the Art of Australian Winemaking,"For Will Berliner of Cloudburst, the vines are a “dojo” that puts him in touch with nature. He also makes great chardonnays, cabernets and malbecs. MARGARET RIVER, Australia — On a warm, sunny day in February, Will Berliner, the proprietor of Cloudburst, crouched and scuttled under the bird netting that had been draped over the vines in his small vineyard just two miles from the Indian Ocean here in Western Australia. I followed, ignoring my aching muscles and sore feet. Some vineyards look barren and inert, the vines awaiting their fate forlornly in dull, sullen solitude. This one, just about three acres, was different. It was alive with the sounds of birds and insects flitting about the sprawling peppermint trees nearby. The smells of fresh earth and green vegetation pervaded the air. If a vineyard can be said to be happy, this one seemed ecstatic. About midway down a row, Mr. Berliner stopped and turned toward me and sat, cross-legged, on the ground between the vines. I joined him. “The vines tell you what to do,” he said. “So I’m here, looking and listening and trying to respond to what they ask.” They apparently communicate pretty well. Mr. Berliner makes small amounts of extraordinary cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and malbec in this center of Western Australian wine production. If Margaret River had a cult wine producer, it might well be Mr. Berliner and Cloudburst. The wines are priced accordingly. Of the roughly 4,800 bottles Cloudburst releases each year, only a few make it to the United States. They range in price from $175 to $250, though if you wander over to Eleven Madison Park in Manhattan you can find the pure, lovely 2013 Cloudburst chardonnay on the list for $310, not an absurd markup against the $200 or so you would pay ordering from the winery. The superb 2012 cabernet sauvignon is $390 on the list, and about $250 at the winery. To others in Margaret River, a laid-back beachside town known as much for its surfing as for its wine, Mr. Berliner, 64, is a bit of an iconoclast, both for his peculiar ways in the vineyard and for his outsize pricing. He is an American, for one thing, born in New York, though married to an Australian woman, Alison Jobson. He only began to plant his vineyard in 2005, and did not move to Margaret River for good until 2012. But Mr. Berliner says, with his vineyard and wine, he is just following his muse and doing what makes sense to him. “To me this is a spiritual path,” he said, as we sat in the vineyard. “There’s a spirit to everything, and this is one of the ways to access it, through the vines.” Mr. Berliner refers to the vineyard as “my dojo,” a Japanese term that Americans generally use for a martial arts training school. But Mr. Berliner uses it more in its original sense: Dojos in Japan were often attached to temples, and had a spiritual component. Students, through the discipline they studied, learned a way of life. “I see winegrowing as a ‘way,’ or awareness path, more than as a vocation, and my focus is on mindfulness and listening rather than commerce,” he said. “To me, the vineyard is a profound space of ritual, learning and spirit that works on me as I work it. To succeed there requires something of me. “I’m so grateful and privileged to have a life where I can be outside.” Mr. Berliner grew up on the South Shore of Long Island, in the towns of East Rockaway and Woodmere. He was always an outdoors kid, he said, who loved camping, walking through swamps, and collecting bugs and abandoned bird nests. He was drawn to the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale, graduating with a degree in biology, and afterward led nature trips while learning about foraging and eating wild foods. He started a company that produced camping equipment. When he sold it, he used the cash to buy 665 acres of forest land in New Hampshire and, in 2004, after three years of searching for a place that spoke to him and his wife, 250 acres adjacent to a national park here in Margaret River. Back then, Mr. Berliner said, he knew little about wine and had no intention of owning a vineyard. His original idea was to plant an avocado grove to block a view of traffic. Local agricultural experts, however, suggested that the rocky, sandy soil would not be good for avocados, though it might be perfect for wine grapes. Ever the willing student, Mr. Berliner found a mentor who introduced him to the classics of wine. He was especially taken, as so many others have been, with the red Bordeaux of Château Margaux, made largely of cabernet sauvignon, and the white Burgundy of Domaine Roulot, made entirely of chardonnay Inspiration in place, Mr. Berliner planted his vineyard slowly, one parcel at a time, observing and learning. This part of Australia is free of phylloxera, the ravenous aphid that preys on the roots of vinifera, the European vine species that accounts for virtually all the classic wine grapes. Mr. Berliner’s vines are planted on their own roots rather than grafted onto American rootstock, which is immune to the bug. His viticulture is radically different from that of most Margaret River growers. He doesn’t irrigate at all, nor does he plow, till or break the ground in any way, because he does not want to disturb the microbial life of the soil. Mr. Berliner supports a growing way of thinking that views vines not as isolated stalks but as a collective society that communicates needs through root systems and fungal colonies of mycelium. He sees the vineyard as a living organism that has its own sort of intelligence, rather than as a group of individual vines. “You can actually listen to what’s at play,” he said. “But we don’t listen. We impose our will on nature, and we’re suffering the consequences of it.” “I point a finger at that state of mind,” he continued, “where people believe they should have convenience over the natural world, and people believe they are more important than it, and know what’s best for it. I don’t subscribe to that idea.” Mr. Berliner prefers not to pigeonhole his form of agriculture as organic, biodynamic or anything else. His idea is not to follow a recipe, but simply to respond to what he perceives the vineyard wants. “Sometimes it calls for weeding, sometimes a particular form of mulch,” he said. “Nature has an ability to bring things to a certain place, if you allow it, if you pay attention. You don’t have to work as hard.” Mr. Berliner extends that notion to the animals with which he shares the land, including birds and kangaroos. He does net the vineyard, but tries to make other food on his property available to them. “I have an orchard — it’s open to them, figs and citrus fruit,” he said. “Take what you want. But please leave the grapes alone.” Even there, sometimes he relents: “Sometimes I let them have a little nibble. ‘O.K., you can have a feed if that’s what you need.’” Mr. Berliner’s winemaking is simple. He presses the whole bunches of grapes, and the juice ferments on its own, with no added yeast. He adds a small amount of sulfur dioxide as a preservative. That’s pretty much it. The chardonnays are pure, energetic and precise. The fine, focused cabernets are elegant and more floral and herbal than is typical in Margaret River. The malbecs are lovely and complex. “My biggest effort is to let nature guide how things go, and not my ego,” he said. “We’re lucky that the wisdom and generosity of Mother Earth is there for us.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

2019,‘A Dog’s Journey’ Review: Good Boys (and Girls) on a Mission,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The preponderance of viral dog videos proves that the animals are sufficiently attractive, intelligent and resourceful that they don’t need stories about their reincarnation to entertain and warm hearts. Nevertheless, we now have “A Dog’s Journey,” the sequel to “A Dog’s Purpose” (2017), all about a multiple-incarnation pooch on a mission to protect a human. We begin with the always-welcome Dennis Quaid, as a farmer with a strong bond to the shaggy St. Bernard/Australian shepherd mix Bailey. As Bailey is put to sleep, Quaid’s character begs the dog to look after his granddaughter CJ. Among the many challenges in CJ’s then-toddler life is Gloria, a single mom possessed of more hostility than the entirety of Elvis Costello’s 1970s output. Gloria becomes a drunk and the older CJ adopts Molly, a delightful beagle/Cavalier King Charles spaniel mix who is, yes, possessed by the spirit of Bailey. (Josh Gad provides the cloying dog voice-over regardless of the gender of any individual beast.) Adult CJ moves to New York and becomes Maggie Rogers with stage fright, or something like that. There, the new incarnation Max, a Yorkshire terrier, “improves” CJ’s life by making her homeless. Directed by Gail Mancuso, the movie is packed with cardboard characters who only exist to check off bad-things-happen plot points. Stick around long enough and irritation may turn into incredulity as “Journey,” with the enthusiasm of a pep squad turning cartwheels, flips an increasing number of morbidity-skirting twists. Could you have predicted, when Molly learned how to be a cancer sniffer, that Max would retain that talent and use it to diagnose a central character? I suppose it’s a genuine achievement that a movie packed with as much delightful canine (and agreeable human) talent as this one should be so insufferable.

2019,‘A Fortunate Man’ Review: A Danish Engineer Strives for Success,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The title “A Fortunate Man” has a double edge, as the movie, whose characters rarely fail to explain their motives and circumstances, never tires of reminding you. The screenwriting, adapted from the Danish author Henrik Pontoppidan’s turn-of-the-20th-century novel “Lucky Per,” hoists subtext so high that it surpasses text. Walk through the room once an hour, and you’ll be good. (The film is now streaming on Netflix.) Directed at an efficient clip by Bille August (whose plodding “Pelle the Conqueror” won an Oscar for foreign-language film), the movie asks whether it is possible to rise above humble origins or whether birth and character are destiny. Peter Andreas (Esben Smed) spurns his father, a rigid vicar, and leaves his home on the peninsula of Jutland to study engineering in Copenhagen. Per, as he is increasingly called, believes that wind and water can be harnessed for energy — and that whoever controls the energy supply will have money and power. But to bring his project to fruition, he needs wealth and connections. So he courts Jakobe (Katrine Greis-Rosenthal), the elder daughter of a well-connected family, in a romance initially rooted more in Per’s ambition than his ardor. But their backgrounds clash: She has a high social standing and is Jewish. He is poor and, despite his desire to reject his father, inwardly conflicted about his strict Christian upbringing. He is also too headstrong to bootlick. The sprawling narrative sometimes gets the best of August. (Is the waitress Per rejects forgotten by him, or just by the movie?) And his habit of over-explaining each new development appears to have removed nuance from a much more textured story. “A Fortunate Man” is a great advertisement for the book.

2019,"‘A Good Career, if I Satisfied Him.’ Ukraine Fights Sexual Abuse, and a War.","VINNYTSIA, Ukraine — On her first day of service as a commissioned officer of the Ukrainian military, Lt. Valeria Sikal reported for duty at her base and received an unusual order. She said the commander, Col. Viktor Ivaniv, ordered her to accompany him in his personal car for a trip to a summerhouse to meet a friend, who turned out to be a local police chief. The colonel then “ordered me to sit beside him,” and though he was her commanding officer, he “tried to touch me and patted my leg,” said Lieutenant Sikal, who is 24 and has become the first woman to speak out about sexual harassment in the Ukrainian Army. “He promised me a good career if I satisfied him,” she said of the episode in January 2018. “I felt like a whore. He was bragging that he could do anything he wanted with us.” Colonel Ivaniv, who declined to be interviewed for this article and has denied engaging in any abuse, has retained his command. A Defense Ministry spokesman, Col. Bohdan Senyk, said that the base commander faced accusations but they had not been proved in court. “Anyone can be accused,” he said. “Men also accuse women.” The country’s military, poor and under tremendous pressure from a smoldering shooting war with Russian-backed rebels, is admired for recent changes that have greatly improved its professionalism and battlefield resilience. The United States has provided more than $1 billion to the Ukrainian Army since 2014. But sexual harassment remains an unacknowledged problem. Formally, the military has promoted attempts to improve gender equality. In 2018, it expanded a list of positions that women can hold to gunners on armored vehicles, snipers and infantry commanders. Sexual harassment is illegal in Ukraine, in private companies and the military. Under the law, superior officers who coerce subordinates into sexual relationships can be jailed for up to six months. Yet, while 57,000 women currently work in the Ukrainian military, with 26,000 on active duty, the authorities last year registered only five sexual harassment cases, including Lieutenant Sikal’s. In the course of the five-year war, no top army commander has ever been disciplined for sexual abuse. Though sexual abuse in the army is widespread, Ukrainian rights groups say, it is typically overlooked in a society reluctant to criticize soldiers during a war. That has led to an agreed conspiracy of silence, said an activist, Vitaly Pavlovsky, director of the nongovernmental group Auditing Authority. If victims speak out, he said, they risk dismissal and the loss of their military housing. “To prove harassment, a victim must find like-minded people or other victims who will be ready to risk their careers,” he said. They must “be ready for conflicts in the family and to be attacked in public,” as was the case with Lieutenant Sikal. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry is reluctant to prosecute sexual abuse in the ranks, Mr. Pavlovsky said, for fear of damaging the image of the army. But protecting abusive officers, he said, only “creates an impotent and weak army, physically and in spirit.” Bolstering Lieutenant Sikal’s case, seven other women have told investigators about alleged sexual harassment by Colonel Ivaniv, according to transcripts provided to a military office that looks into morale problems in the army, but does not have authority to press charges. One woman said he had forced her to sleep with a general, according to the transcripts. Another said she resorted to asking her male relatives to help protect her from him. Colonel Ivaniv’s former deputy, Lt. Col. Viktor Mishchuk, said he had been compelled to carry out demeaning and abusive orders on behalf of the colonel. “Ivaniv noticed that a girl had three earrings in one ear,” he said in a phone interview. “He asked me to check if she had piercings on her breasts,” as well. “With his actions, he humiliates the honor and dignity of a Ukrainian military officer.” Women harassed at work say they do not trust the authorities to take their side, so few report the episodes. “Unfortunately, this is a problem not only of the Ukrainian Army, but of our society,” said Alona Kryvuliak of La Strada Ukraine, a group opposing gender discrimination. “These cases kill the inner motivation for women to seek help.” Ukraine, of course, is hardly the only country with sexual abuse in the military. This year, Senator Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican who was the first American female fighter pilot to fly in combat, told a committee hearing that a superior officer in the Air Force had raped her, and that when she tried to report it to military officials she “felt like the system was raping me all over again.” For Lieutenant Sikal, the trip to the summerhouse on Jan. 3, 2018, was just the start. There, sitting with the police chief, Lieutenant Sikal said the colonel boasted of the attractive junior officers under his command. He then asked her to kiss the policeman, she said. “He bragged that he had two young, new female lieutenants and suggested we all take a sauna together,” she said, her voice trembling. For months, she said, daily harassment ensued and she tried a variety of ways to escape him. She tried hiding and directly confronting him with a plea to stop. Nothing worked. “His apartment was one floor above mine” in the barracks, she said. “He was coming drunk, checking my underwear in the drawers of my nightstand. Once, he said my sofa was good and suggested we check it.” Every new rejection caused further humiliation, punitive reprimands and senseless orders, she said. “I was not a human for him,” Lieutenant Sikal said. Finally last December, she filed a sexual harassment complaint with military prosecutors and the national police authorities that is still under investigation. She said the local police did not take Lieutenant Sikal’s complaint seriously until activists pressured the leadership. An officer on a military hotline for complaints said he could do nothing. Prosecutors initially rejected her written report. She said she felt invisible to the police. It is far from clear whether Lieutenant Sikal will prevail in her case. After she gave interviews to the Ukrainian news media, a taxi driver tried to punch her when she got into his cab, she said. Fellow soldiers heaped abuse on her online. “Valeria, if you cannot resist ordinary harassment in training, what will happen to you in a combat unit or if you are captured,” one man, who identified himself as Yuriy Opr, wrote in comments under an article in Strana.ru, an online news portal. “Her approach has no place in the armed forces,” he added. “I am writing for myself and my sworn brothers.” A man who identified himself as Viktor Margelov wrote, “Why did you wait a year” before filing a complaint? Another, Pavel Vasiliev, answered, “Perhaps she liked it.” Lieutenant Sikal’s husband, Oleksi Vdovychenko, himself a veteran of the war in eastern Ukraine, now regularly receives anonymous phone threats. “I don’t feel that the state can defend me,” Lieutenant Sikal said. “The state is passive in this case.” video",The New York Times
2019,‘A New Enemy but the Same Hate’: Can Sri Lanka Heal Its Divisions?,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka is an impossibly lovely island, a pendant suspended off the Indian subcontinent that for centuries attracted traders and evangelists in search of spices and souls. But this is also a war-wounded nation that popularized the use of the suicide bomber vest, a place far more compact than the Balkans yet cleaved by more divisions: ethnic, religious and class. If it is renowned for its beauty, Sri Lanka has become equally defined by its hate. With the government’s reluctance to address these schisms, every violent episode breeds fear that the nation will fracture in new and unexpected ways, leading to yet more bloodshed. “We have many clashes of civilizations on a small island,” said Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri, a University of Colombo historian of Sri Lankan national identity. “It’s hard to know how to overcome our divided history.” This month, Sri Lanka will mark a decade of peace after 26 years of civil war between the Sinhalese-majority state and a Tamil separatist movement. But hopes of celebrating that calm were shattered last month on Easter Sunday when suicide bombers claimed by the Islamic State targeted Christian churches and luxury hotels, killing at least 250 people and weaving Sri Lanka into a web of global terrorism. Tensions remained high on Monday, more than two weeks after the attacks, as Sri Lanka deployed additional troops to Negombo, one of the sites of the Easter bombings, after clashes the day before between Muslims and Sinhalese. “Well, it was very nice for us to have 10 years of relative freedom and safety,” said M.A. Sumanthiran, a prominent legislator and human rights lawyer. “Now it’s back to normal in Sri Lanka. We have a new enemy but the same hate.” Mr. Sumanthiran was sitting in his study in the capital, Colombo, effectively a hostage in his own home. Downstairs, armed guards were on alert. Months ago, military intelligence had warned that resurgent Tamil separatists wanted his assassination. Last week, they cautioned that Muslim militants also had him in their sights. Since independence in 1948, one Sri Lankan president and one prime minister have been assassinated. Sri Lankan extremists have also killed dozens of local politicians and a former prime minister of India. In the wake of last month’s bombings, in which repeated warnings were ignored that militants were planning attacks, some Sri Lankans have called for the return of the security state that brought an end to war in 2009. Yet that peace came at the cost of up to 40,000 Tamil lives, according to the United Nations. A few days after the Easter attacks, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the defense chief who led that deadly final push against Tamil separatists, announced that he was running for president in elections set for later this year, on a get-tough-again platform. Mr. Sumanthiran, a Christian Tamil, is adamant that more soldiers and the return of a feared military intelligence network are the last thing Sri Lanka needs. Mr. Rajapaksa, who is considered the front-runner in the race, is being accused of crimes against humanity in a California court. “The heavy hand of the security state will breed extremism of all kinds,” Mr. Sumanthiran said. “Our problem is that, fundamentally, minority rights, religious or ethnic, are treated with disrespect and with force by the government. Until we resolve this, Sri Lanka will be stained in blood.” Traveling through Sri Lanka is like venturing into a kaleidoscope, each piece shifting and separate. A Buddhist heartland, with verdant hills and saffron-robed monks, gives way to neighborhoods of mosques and men in prayer caps. Later, along the same road, comes a Hindu village, with its diversity of gods decorating homes. Occasionally, a cross juts out from a Roman Catholic or Protestant church or the windshield of a trishaw driver. The Easter bombings may have been particularly bloody, but the targeting of places of worship in this multiethnic, multifaith nation is not new. In 1998, Tamil separatists attacked one of the world’s holiest sites, the temple in central Sri Lanka where a relic believed to be the Buddha’s tooth is kept. That temple was also targeted in 1989 by communist extremists. Over the course of the civil war between insurgents from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sinhalese-majority state, the military descended upon Christian churches and Hindu temples where Tamils had sought refuge. The Tamil Tigers responded by massacring dozens of Buddhist monks. In 1990, they infiltrated evening prayers at two mosques, killing more than 100 Muslims who were considered government collaborators. Sri Lanka cannot be divided neatly by race, faith or language. The population is more than 70 percent Sinhalese; most are Buddhists, a minority is Christian. Around 10 percent of the country is Tamil, largely Hindu and Christian. Muslims occupy another 10 percent and are considered a distinct ethnicity even though many speak Tamil. The Constitution affords special status to Buddhism, which for many Sinhalese is synonymous with their ethnicity. After the Tamils were defeated, a Buddhist nationalist movement gained favor with the government, and extremist monks turned their attention to new enemies: Muslims and Christians. Since the war’s end, dozens of mosques and churches have been attacked by Sinhalese mobs. Last year, at least one Muslim was killed in violence near the city of Kandy, where the Temple of the Tooth Relic is. This year, on Palm Sunday, a week before the Easter bombings, Sinhalese pelted stones at a center run by the Methodist church. Sinhalese enjoy numerical superiority in Sri Lanka, but some accuse a growing evangelical Christian movement of stealing souls. They also claim that minority Muslims and Hindus have a plan to overwhelm the island by fecundity. “I will be accused of racism, but I know what they want is a Muslim Sri Lanka,” said Dilanthe Withanage, a former spokesman for Bodu Bala Sena, the most influential Buddhist nationalist group. “By 2040, they will have a majority of the population and they will buy Sinhalese politicians to make the country run by Shariah law.” Demographics are unlikely to prove Mr. Withanage correct. But the feeling that the Sinhalese are an embattled majority has meant that minorities receive less-than-equal treatment from the government, which in turn fosters resentment. For years, the nation’s Hindus were governed by the Buddhism ministry. Another ministry governs tourism, wildlife and Christian affairs. “Sinhalese people don’t consider us real Sri Lankans, so maybe I can understand when Muslims are attracted by Islamic State, which welcomes them into a brotherhood,” said M.M. Moinudeen, an imam from the eastern city of Batticaloa, the site of one of the Easter bombings. Such is the power of the Buddhist political establishment that when John Amaratunga, the minister of tourism, wildlife and Christian religious affairs, made an offhand comment in an interview about the organizational differences between Buddhism and Catholicism, aides spent 10 minutes explaining why publishing the remark could prove disastrous for communal relations. At the Sri Manika Vinayagar Hindu Temple in Colombo, Ganeshan, a textile merchant who goes by one name, eyed the soldiers who have guarded the entrance since the Easter bombings. In the early days of Sri Lanka’s civil war, as pogroms against Tamils forced entire villages to flee, this temple housed a makeshift camp for refugees. Mr. Ganeshan was one of them. “People talk with their tongues about peace, but their hearts are not in it, because as long as one community wants to rule another, it will not stop,” he said. “For all of us, even if this attack was Muslims against Christians, we live in fear because it could always go back again.” But in another neighborhood of Colombo, amid houses with Arabic prayers over their doors and others with altars to Christian saints, stood a Bodhi tree and the Buddhist temple that grew around it. Kolonnawe Narada Thero, the temple abbot, said anyone was welcome. He was not scared of Buddhist extremists, he said. After an evangelical Christian church and school were forced out of nearby premises in 2011, he welcomed the Christians and their students into his compound. Today, children supported by the Christian charity still study on temple grounds. “If you have a garden and only have roses, it will not be as beautiful as if you have lots of different flowers,” the abbot said. “In Sri Lanka, if you only have one culture or religion, you lose the diversity, the beauty.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Aladdin’ Gives Disney Another Live-Action Hit,"The studio’s latest remake, with Will Smith as the blue genie, beat expectations at the box office over the holiday weekend. This time last year, Disney was picking up the pieces after a notoriously disappointing opening for “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” The studio had better luck this year — with a genie’s help. Disney’s live-action “Aladdin,” with Will Smith as the blue genie, brought in around $86.1 million domestically from Friday through Sunday, according to the studio. Disney says it expects the North American total for the long Memorial Day weekend, Friday through Monday, to reach $105 million, exceeding analysts’ expectations. That is a strong showing for a movie that cost a reported $183 million to make, particularly given the additional $121 million the studio says the movie made overseas through Sunday. “Aladdin” is the latest in Disney’s series of live-action remakes of its animated classics. The previous entry, Tim Burton’s “Dumbo,” earned $45 million in North America in its opening weekend in March. Other than Smith, the new “Aladdin” doesn’t come with much star power: Mena Massoud, a Canadian actor whose most prominent role had been as a recurring character in the Amazon series “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” plays Aladdin opposite the British actress Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine. Nasim Pedrad, once of “Saturday Night Live,” plays Jasmine’s handmaiden. [Read our critic’s review of “Aladdin.”] The movie’s success also comes despite middling reviews. It currently holds a 58 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Like its animated predecessor, this “Aladdin,” directed by Guy Ritchie, tells the story of a young street thief who finds his happily-ever-after with a princess, thanks largely to a genie who can grant him three wishes. Speaking of three wishes coming true: Disney can now say that it is behind the top three highest-grossing openings so far in 2019. Only the Disney-Marvel movies “Captain Marvel” (opening weekend: $153.4 million) and “Avengers: Endgame” ($357.1 million) had better openings than “Aladdin.” And “Avengers: Endgame” is still making money. That superhero movie came in third this weekend with around $16.8 million in domestic ticket sales from Friday to Sunday, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Second place went to Lionsgate’s “John Wick: Chapter 3,” which sold $24.4 million in tickets over the three-day period. The only other newcomer in the top five was Sony’s “Brightburn,” a superhero origin story that mixes in elements of horror. Both genres have produced notable box-office successes in recent years, and “Brightburn” brought in around $7.5 million through Sunday; the movie’s reported budget was $6 million. United Artists’s “Booksmart,” the critically lauded directorial debut of the actress Olivia Wilde, landed in sixth place with $6.5 million in ticket sales over the three-day period.",The New York Times
2019,‘Aladdin’ Review: This Is Not What You Wished For,"A threadbare magic-carpet ride to nowhere special, with Will Smith as a blue genie. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Aladdin,” the 1992 cartoon feature with Robin Williams as a garrulous blue genie, may not be the best movie from Disney’s second golden age of animation, but like the others it has durable charms and memorable songs. “Aladdin,” the new live-action re-whatever with a blue Will Smith popping out of the lamp, may not be the worst product of the current era of legacy intellectual property exploitation (it’s likely that the worst is yet to come), but like most of the others it invites a simple question: Why? The answer — spoiler alert: “money” — may not surprise you. I know it’s pointless to complain about Disney’s drive to wring every last dollar from its various brands. You might as well complain about the animal sidekicks (and I will). But the movie itself, while not entirely terrible — a lot of craft has been purchased, and even a little art — is pointless in a particularly aggressive way. [Read an interview with Mena Massoud, who plays Aladdin.] The studio’s earlier cash-grab strategy was to protect the classic status of its “A” material through managed scarcity and lavish reissuing. Each new micro-generation of viewers could be initiated into fandom with a bit of ceremony: Here was an old thing that was being passed on to you in a shiny new package, a polished heirloom in the form of a special VHS or DVD edition or a limited run in theaters. What had belonged to your parents and grandparents could also be yours, whether it was “Snow White” or “The Little Mermaid.” (Not anymore with “Song of the South,” though.) There were problems with this approach, including the preservation of tropes and images that came to seem old-fashioned, and not necessarily in a good way. The patriarchal princess stories. The cultural and racial stereotypes. That kind of thing. But Disney, long committed to doing well by meaning well, has synergized evolving social attitudes with advancing digital technology to concoct a series of updates. None of these have surpassed the original, but that might be too much to ask. I can’t think of one — not “The Jungle Book”; not “Mary Poppins Returns”; not the recent, somber “Dumbo”; certainly not this “Aladdin” — that seems able to stand alone in the popular imagination. They are weird and grotesque hybrids, belonging to no particular era, style or creative sensibility, like dishes at a chain restaurant that fuse disparate food trends to produce flavors alien to every known earthly cuisine. “Aladdin” is not a cartoon, but it takes place in cartoonlike spaces that trade the grace and flow of animation for the cold literalism of computer-generated imagery. The animal sidekicks — a mischievous monkey, a loyal tiger and a malignant parrot — are neither cute nor especially realistic. The human beings occupying the frame alongside them look, with the partial exception of the genie, like people dressed up as Disney characters. They run and jump and dance and sing and wear excruciatingly bright costumes, almost never memorably. Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is a thief plying his trade in the marketplaces of the vaguely, vividly Middle Eastern fantasyland of Agrabah, where he meets and falls for Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). Her father, the kindly old Sultan (Navid Negahban), is being undermined by his diabolical vizier, Jafar (Marwan Kenzari). Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, are joined by a magic carpet and a blue genie who grants wishes and also develops a crush on Jasmine’s handmaiden, Dalia (Nasim Pedrad). The casting is admirable. There’s a brisk, enjoyable early chase through the casbah — the kind of springy action that the director, Guy Ritchie, does pretty well — and a couple of Bollywood-inflected numbers that remind you, pleasantly enough, of the proud history of the musical as a film genre. Some of the voices may make you regret the reminder. (Scott’s is by far the strongest; Smith is not a great singer). You’ll hear a few favorites from the old “Aladdin,” with new lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Alan Menken is still a wonderful composer, by the way. But somehow the most familiar songs, rather than lending luster to this version of the story (written by Ritchie and John August), only highlight its incoherence. “A Whole New World,” sung as Aladdin and Jasmine take a moonlit carpet ride above Agrabah and other picturesque locales, conveys neither the novelty of flight nor the wonder of discovery. The visuals are tired and perfunctory green-screen placeholders. Similarly, the genie’s showstopper, “Friend Like Me” undermines its own premise. We’ve had an awful lot of shape-shifting, motor-mouthed “friends” like this one. One of the new songs, belted out with great conviction by Scott, is called “Speechless,” a ham-fisted attempt to paste some power-princess feminism into the film that feels almost as condescending as the women-in-battle sequence in “Avengers: Endgame.” And as for the film’s supposed lessons — that you should just be yourself and not be seduced by wealth and power — I mean, come on. What makes the Disney classics, old and new, so durable is their ability to fuse commercialism with magic in a way that overwhelms cynicism. When that fails, what we’re left with is thievery.

For Ruby and Gensan (Karen Gillan and Dastmalchian, both incredible), life in downtown Los Angeles is a daily struggle of bottom-rung jobs, scratch cards and garbage-rifling. After both are fired through no fault of their own, Gensan unwisely bets his severance pay on an illegal cockfight that leaves him fleeing the law with a stolen car and a blood-spattered wad of cash. From there, it’s all downhill — especially when Ruby joins him bearing a box whose contents immeasurably increases their peril. On one level, “All Creatures Here Below” is a well-worn look at life on the margins. Its ideas aren’t new, and at times Ruby and Gensan can feel like recognizable symbols of societal failure. What’s different, though, is the performers’ skill in portraying characters whose extreme mutual dependence is touchingly believable, giving no hint of the damage later revealed. If Ruby seems a little slow, and Gensan quick to anger, then poor education and extreme poverty can be blamed. And when they’re forced to return home to Kansas City — and a past that neither wants to revisit — their fates feel heartbreakingly inevitable. A movie about calamitous choices and the constraints that shape them, “Creatures” places its leads in one moral trap after another. Despite this, the actors miraculously keep us on their side — until, finally, they can’t.

2019,"‘All Is True’ Review: Regret Is the Thing, as Shakespeare Comes Home","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. With some movies, it’s best not to allow worries over historical accuracy to derail our enjoyment. And there’s plenty to enjoy in “All Is True,” Kenneth Branagh’s fondly poignant look at William Shakespeare’s final years. Not much is known about that time, after the playwright’s beloved Globe Theatre burned to the ground in 1613 and he returned to his family home in Stratford-upon-Avon. It’s not a peaceful retirement. Reconnecting with his neglected wife (Judi Dench, brilliantly huffy) and two variously troubled daughters (Kathryn Wilder and Lydia Wilson) is challenging, to say the least. But if Ben Elton’s screenplay benefits from dramatic imaginings and factual fudging, I’m content that Branagh — who stars as well as directs and whose devotion to Shakespeare is inarguable — be the one to approve them. The result is more country soap than biopic, a slow and soothing tale of family secrets and festering resentments. A little soppy and a tad dull — Will putters constantly in the garden, mourning the long-ago death of his young son — the movie is so sedately paced that Branagh’s distracting prosthetic nose can seem to enter scenes well before the rest of him. Yet while “All Is True” might not brim with excitement, it’s beautifully acted, richly photographed (by Zac Nicholson) and blessedly free of histrionics. Between them, Branagh and Elton have concocted a respectful story of loss, regret and wistful genius. Their Shakespeare is sad and a little weary, but far from beaten down, evidenced by the movie’s most pleasurable scene: An extended fireside chinwag between Will and his longtime crush, the Earl of Southampton (a wicked Ian McKellen). Whether all is true here is irrelevant: just watching these two old hands lovingly quote Sonnet 29 together feels right enough for me.

2019,"‘Although I Tried to Look Away, I Saw Him Gesture Toward Me’","METROPOLITAN DIARY Eavesdropping at dinner, a favor repaid on the M116 and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: It was winter 1976. My wife and I had hoped to get tickets to “A Chorus Line.” At the time, it was possible to go to the box office on the afternoon of a performance and buy tickets that had been returned or had not been sold. But none were available that day. Disappointed, we went for a walk in Central Park and then went to La Maison Japonaise for dinner. We were seated upstairs, where our corner table was near one by the window. That table was occupied by a man who appeared to be about 60 and a much younger woman. They were having an argument, and the woman was furious. Because the tables were very close together, I could hear every word she said. I was facing the woman’s back, and I could see the man on the far side of their table. Although I tried to look away, I saw him gesture toward me. To my surprise, he invited us to join them. “You now know a lot about us,” he said, “so let’s all get to know each other.” We moved to their table and enjoyed our dinner talking with them. Walking behind the women as we left the restaurant, the man handed me an envelope. “As you know, I can’t spend the evening we had planned,” he said. In the envelope were two tickets to “A Chorus Line,” sixth row center. — Robert Gold Dear Diary: I was on an M116 bus. A big fellow got on and sat down next to me. “Your shoelace is untied,” a woman sitting across from him said. Looking down, he saw that one of his laces was indeed untied so much that he might have tripped over it. “Thank you,” he said, bending over to tie the lace. “You saved my life.” He looked across the aisle at the woman. “Now your shoelace is untied,” he said. Remarkably, it was. The woman bent down to tie her shoelace. “I’m happy to reciprocate,” the man said. — Marvin Schissel Dear Diary: Fifty years ago, I had just moved to New York from South Carolina to begin my first job at a publishing company. My income was negligible, and I could barely afford even the cheap hotel where I was staying. Still, as I was walking through Herald Square, I couldn’t resist stopping to browse at a small used-book stall. I found a couple of “Saint” paperbacks by Leslie Charteris that I hadn’t read. I paid a nickel for each of them, and started to read one that evening. When I got to the end of the first chapter, I found a $10 bill tucked inside. A little further into the book, I found another one. I continued flipping through the book and ended up with five $10 bills. That covered my first week’s hotel bill. — Carol Robinson Dear Diary: I was strolling along the Central Park bridle path near the reservoir on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The cherry trees were in full bloom, and the path was crowded with people of all kinds. Two folk singers who appeared to be in their early 20s were strumming guitars and singing a song of emerging love. They said they had composed it themselves as a reflection of their own relationship. A gust of wind shook the trees and sent blossoms showering down on the crowd. Children, shouting gleefully, tried to catch the tiny petals. Amid all the movement and excitement, I noticed an older couple, possibly in their early 90s. The man, wrinkled and thin, was pushing the woman, who seemed even more fragile, in a wheelchair. I looked at them and smiled. Catching my eye, the man gestured toward the surrounding scene, and then he pointed to the woman. “This is what makes her happy,” he said. — Wendy Katkin Dear Diary: For years, my wife and I noticed a car parked in our neighborhood that was identical to our beige 2001 Toyota Corolla. We often mistook it for our car when we didn’t remember where we had parked. When we traded our car in for a new one, we were left with a brand-new hubcap we had never used that did not fit the new car. We were about to throw it out when we noticed that our old car’s twin was missing a hubcap. We went out one night and put it on the car’s bare rim. A month later, we noticed the Corolla with the new hubcap parked in front of a building where we knew the doorman. Thinking the car might be his, we casually asked if it was. He said it belonged to people who lived in the building. Then he smiled broadly. “You’re the hubcap people!” he shouted. — Alan Robbins Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,"‘Always Be My Maybe’ Review: Romance, Food and Fame Through a Sitcom Lens","Ali Wong and Randall Park struggle to find chemistry in this romantic comedy with an appealingly diverse cast. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Always Be My Maybe” feels a lot like a movie propped up by a stunt, a high-gloss romantic comedy so mired in triteness and unconvincing emotions that its main recommendation is the appealing diversity of its cast. That stunt is a wonderfully self-deprecating appearance by Keanu Reeves, but we’ll get to him in a moment. The early scenes, set in San Francisco in the 1990s, have a charming ease as young Sasha (Miya Cech), a lonely only child, finds solace at the home of her friend and neighbor, Marcus (Emerson Min). The enticing Korean meals cooked by Marcus’s mother (Susan Park) are especially consoling, so it’s no surprise to find the adult Sasha (the dauntingly confident Ali Wong) swanning around Los Angeles as a glitzy celebrity chef. One-pot comfort food, though, has been replaced by elaborate plates of Instagrammable art, which is how we know that Sasha has lost touch with her roots. The movie is rife with this kind of shorthand, sketching characters’ flaws and attributes in broad sitcom strokes: Sasha’s faithless and short-lived fiancé, a restaurateur who practices capoeira, gives Daniel Dae Kim little to play but an empty suit. Even so, he’s a more credible partner for Sasha than Marcus (a bashful Randall Park), who might look like an adult but hasn’t yet figured out how to behave like one. [Ali Wong and Randall Park on why they made the movie.] When they reunite, he’s a grumpy, ambitionless air-conditioning technician and the frontman for an ear-shreddingly awful band, still driving the car he lost his virginity in 15 years earlier. Once again, we have a smart, successful woman hooking up with a weed-smoking low achiever, albeit one who bucks formula somewhat by failing to drag her down to his level. (It’s hard to imagine anyone played by Wong, who first drew attention for her outrageously funny 2016 special “Baby Cobra,” being dragged anywhere she doesn’t want to go.) Small consolation in a movie littered with Spanx jokes, money-focused Asian stereotypes and embarrassingly humorless setups. One particularly wince-worthy scene has Marcus ruin his band’s crucial audition by drunkenly relieving himself on an amplifier. Directed by Nahnatchka Khan, the showrunner of the sharp ABC comedy “Fresh Off the Boat” (which Park stars in and Wong used to write for), “Always Be My Maybe” never shakes off those sitcom shackles. It does, however, gain a lot of mileage by lampooning a familiar kind of culinary ostentatiousness — like Sasha promising that her latest establishment will feature “transdenominational” Vietnamese food — that peaks in a perfectly staged dinner for four in a restaurant whose name, Maximal, says it all. Into this circus of edible absurdity (the meal was scrupulously designed by the kaiseki chef Niki Nakayama) strides Reeves, in windblown slow-motion and accompanied by lustful growls on the soundtrack, as if borne on the back of a horny elephant. Playing Sasha’s celebrity squeeze, Reeves has enormous fun spoofing his action-movie persona and pricking Hollywood pretensions. But he’s a trick, a pointless publicity bomb whose explosion only highlights Marcus and Sasha’s complete lack of sexual chemistry. Their friendship feels real; their romance as unlikely as the food served at Maximal. Always Be My Maybe Rated PG-13 for teens getting deflowered and adults getting aroused.

2019,‘Aniara’ Review: A One-Way Ticket Into the Abyss,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In the harrowing Swedish science-fiction epic “Aniara,” a spacecraft designed to make the voyage from a ruined Earth to a colony on Mars hits both debris and disaster. The turbulence from the impact soon passes, allowing the ship, the Aniara, to stabilize. The film’s plucky protagonist, MR (Emelie Jonsson), returns to her job with the crew — placating anxious passengers with images of Earth before fires turned the blue marble brown. But once it becomes evident that the ship ejected its fuel when it hit the debris, it is impossible to dream away brutal reality: Without fuel, the Aniara and its passengers are doomed to drift in the infinite emptiness of space. “Aniara” is closely based on a poem written by the Swedish writer Harry Martinson in 1956. In adapting Martinson’s tale of a spaceship hurtling into the abyss, the filmmakers Pella Kagerman and Hugo Lilja take a muted approach, using sets that are more corporate than futuristic and directing their actors to underplay the melodrama. Doom can seem romantic on the page, where the reader has room to roam. But witnessing it here is depressing. Kagerman and Lilja thoughtfully constructed their film, yet they leave nothing for the mind to do besides consume unrelenting tragedy. Society crumbles, filth accumulates in hallways, beloved characters succumb to despair. The viewer is as trapped as the would-be colonists. At times, the commitment to bleakness feels artistically admirable. The film unblinkingly faces the void, and it refuses to console the audience, which has come along for the ride. But mostly, this is a movie that simulates the experience of losing the will to live, a daunting premise even for the bravest voyagers.

2019,‘Arthur’ Opens Season With a Same-Sex Wedding and a Cake,"During the season premiere of the animated series “Arthur” on Monday, Arthur, Francine, Buster and Muffy spend most of their time trying to play matchmaker for their third-grade teacher, Mr. Ratburn. In the end, Mr. Ratburn has his own plans. He ties the knot with Patrick, a local chocolatier, at a wedding attended by the students. “Mr. Ratburn is married, I still can’t believe it,” Arthur says. “Yup, it’s a brand-new world,” Francine responds. The episode, titled “Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone,” was the latest moment in daytime television to include a more diverse set of characters as it kicked off the show’s 22nd season. The series, which airs on PBS Kids and debuted in 1996, follows the adventures of Arthur, his classmates and his family. “PBS Kids programs are designed to reflect the diversity of communities across the nation,” Maria Vera Whelan, the senior director of marketing, communications and social media for children’s media and education at PBS, said in a statement. “We believe it is important to represent the wide array of adults in the lives of children who look to PBS Kids every day.” In the episode, the students start to play matchmaker when they suspect that Mr. Ratburn might be marrying Patty, a woman they think is ill-suited for him. (She’s actually his sister.) They try to set him up with a librarian, but it doesn’t work out. On the day of the wedding, Mr. Ratburn walks down the aisle arm in arm with Patrick, his partner. They smile at each other, and Patrick winks at Arthur in the crowd. Afterward, the students eat cake (Mr. Ratburn’s favorite), which was shown earlier in the episode with two toppers that resemble Mr. Ratburn and Patrick. “Arthur” isn’t the only animated children’s show to recently feature same-sex weddings or relationships. Last summer the Cartoon Network series “Steven Universe” depicted a same-sex wedding in which the main character, Steven, officiated the nuptials of two female characters, Ruby and Sapphire. Another Cartoon Network series, “Adventure Time,” established a same-sex relationship when two main characters, Princess Bubblegum and Marceline the Vampire Queen, kissed. “Sesame Street,” a PBS mainstay, has also tried to become inclusive. In 2017, the show introduced Julia, a female muppet who has autism. In September, the internet exploded over the possibility that Bert and Ernie might be partners. In December, the show introduced Lily, a muppet who is homeless and living in shelters and on friends’ couches. The 2018-19 report “Where We Are on TV,” released by Glaad, an organization that tracks representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the media, noted some recent strides. The report found that “8.8% of broadcast scripted series regulars are L.G.B.T.Q. characters,” a record high. Of the 857 series regular characters counted on 111 prime-time scripted shows across a variety of networks, 75 identified as L.G.B.T.Q., an increase from 58 in 2017. “I think it is really important that L.G.B.T.Q. people are having families in historic numbers and that we are seeing our family in media and reflected back to us, especially our children,” Sarah Kate Ellis, the president of Glaad, said in an interview on Tuesday. Last year Glaad added a category for children and family programming to its annual media awards because there was finally enough content to consider, she said. “You know at a very young age if you are trans and gay or bisexual and lesbian,” Ms. Ellis said. “To be able to see yourself reflected is critical.” Ms. Ellis said the openness that millennials — many who grew up watching “Arthur” — have about their lives and themselves has contributed to the increase in inclusivity across media platforms. “I think that they are now in positions of power to create content, and they are reflecting the world as they know it,” Ms. Ellis said. “That is positive, and I think it is going to have a huge impact on the next generation of L.G.B.T.Q. people.” Some on social media said they were not nearly as surprised about Mr. Ratburn’s same-sex marriage as they were that “Arthur” was still airing new episodes. “Season 22?! I didn’t know they were still making episodes of Arthur,” one user wrote on Twitter. “I used to watch it everyday as a kid. Also congrats to Mr. Ratburn and his love on their marriage.” one user wrote on Twitter. It might not be a brand-new world for millennials after all.",The New York Times
2019,‘Asako I & II’ Review: Double the Love (and the Heartbreak),"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The bewitching and sometimes unsettling Japanese romantic drama “Asako I & II” begins in the early 2000s. Outside an Osaka art gallery that’s hosting an exhibition by the photographer Shigeo Gocho, pretty and shy Asako (Erika Karata) is approached by Baku (Masahiro Higashide), a strikingly handsome and brash guy with goofily floppy hair. He’s bad news and even he knows it. He DJs. He starts fights with guys who try to dance with Asako. He goes out for pastries and doesn’t come back until the next day. One of his exits seems to contain a phantom whisper of Antonioni’s “L’Avventura,” but that’s not the affair’s turning point. His no-return disappearance is relayed in the movie’s sole use of narration, by Asako herself. A couple of years later, Asako is working in a coffee shop in Tokyo, supplying carafes of the brew to a sake-marketing firm next door. Ryohei, an awkward young salaryman there, is Baku’s double — so exact as to be played by the same actor, in a quietly stunning dual performance. He’s Baku’s total opposite, personality-wise: almost recessively shy and possibly a bit dim. Both parties are resistant to romance, until Ryohei falls hard. This quickly repels the wary Asako, who hasn’t told Ryohei about Baku. A galvanic urban event finally brings them together. The couple fall into a domesticity that several years on seems to be splitting the difference between contentment and complacency. At which point Baku makes his presence felt again, when a friend of Asako points out the old boyfriend’s portrait on a billboard. The film’s director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, who wrote the screenplay with Sachiko Tanaka, makes features about young people in contemporary Japan that vary wildly in scale. This movie is a fat-free two hours, while his last feature, “Happy Hour,” was a Rivette-evoking five-plus. “Asako” proceeds from a premise that flirts with the mystic, but Hamaguchi executes it with elegantly rendered realism. (It is adapted from a 2010 novel by Tomoka Shibasaki.) The result is a picture that is simultaneously engaging and disconcerting. There’s a scene in which Ryohei drags his co-worker Kushihashi (Koji Seto) to a home-cooking double date at the apartment Asako shares with Maya (Rio Yamashita), a fledgling television actress. It’s bad enough that Kushihashi has already expressed a distaste for the meal Asako is preparing; he also lays into Maya for what he considers her stiff, provincial reading of Chekhov, based on a clip from a televised production she shows the men at Asako’s request. The scene presents several potential exit ramps at which Hamaguchi could cut, but he barrels through the discomfort to brake the action at a surprising resolution. And he stages and shoots within the cramped apartment setting with superb control of the dramatic stresses he wants to put across. This proficiency serves the movie well, especially in its double climax, which purposely tests both credulity and whatever affinity the viewer may have had for its title character up to that point. Asako’s vulnerability concerning Baku somersaults into a moment of determined abandon. It’s breathtaking and appalling. But, the movie will leave you asking, is it actually appalling, or only appalling within the conventional wisdom of romantic drama? The provocation is apt to haunt you for some time after the lights go up.

2019,‘Ask Dr. Ruth’ Review: Out of the Bedroom and into the Light,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. There was a time in the 1980s when Dr. Ruth Westheimer, petite sex guru and irrepressible advocate of democratized pleasure, seemed to be everywhere. In bookstores and on the radio, or perched alongside a squirming Johnny Carson or David Letterman, she thrust the female orgasm to center stage while reassuring men that its achievement didn’t require supersized equipment. It’s hard to explain how revolutionary her humor, candor and sexual explicitness seemed for the time. Nothing was off the table: when H.I.V./AIDS and homosexuality were barely acknowledged publicly, she was there with fact-based advice and warm encouragement. Now the woman who just wants everyone to feel good gets an equally flushed tribute in “Ask Dr. Ruth,” Ryan White’s rose-tinted overview of a remarkable life. Almost 91, and after 54 years in the same New York City apartment, Westheimer hasn’t flagged. Bustling from book event to birthday party to business meeting, she continues to write (three books in 2018 alone), teach and advise on all things conjugal or otherwise consenting. Succumbing to this tiny tornado, White cedes control of the narrative as she recounts her German-Jewish family’s Holocaust experiences and her childhood in a Swiss orphanage. Spells as a trainee sniper and Sorbonne student precede her rise to fame, accomplished while barreling through three husbands, a doctorate and multiple sexual taboos. Leaving no room for naysayers, “Ask Dr. Ruth” is a juggernaut of admiration, too sentimental in places for a woman whose barricaded emotions and ceaseless activity are, according to her daughter, Miriam, possible survival mechanisms. But that’s as close as we get to analyzing the analyst, leaving us with a movie that feels more like an encomium than a thoughtful probe of a brilliantly mutinous mind.

2019,‘At the Heart of Gold’ Review: A Thorough Record of Sexual Abuse,"Critic’s PIck When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “It’s almost like being a wounded animal,” is how one former athlete describes the psychology of a gymnast in Erin Lee Carr’s “At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal.” “You don’t show your weakness. You don’t show that you’re hurt.” As Carr’s documentary demonstrates, Lawrence G. Nassar, the former doctor for the American gymnastics team, exploited this mind-set when he sexually abused hundreds of girls for decades. His victims were often so young as to not realize what was being done to them, but had also bought into the stoic philosophy of a sport in which pain is a constant. The many revelations about Nassar have already been widely reported, but Carr’s film, which is also available on HBO, works as a worthwhile précis, featuring interviews with many of the women who came forward. Nassar had been active for so long that the victims’ ages vary widely; some had known him for years and even considered him a friend. There is a lot to go over here — including the many individuals who covered for Nassar in an effort to protect a money-making sport — and one 90-minute documentary can only do so much. What really comes through, however, is how Nassar abused the trust of being not just a doctor, but a seemingly kind, well-liked one. Sometimes, we learn, the molestation took place while a parent was in the room; everyone just assumed that if a doctor was doing it, it couldn’t be wrong. It’s a chilling reminder that real predators rarely look and act like movie monsters.

2019,‘Avengers: Endgame’ Has Taken Over the World. Let’s Talk About Fan Service and Marvel’s Legacy,"With “Endgame” hijacking the box office — and the cultural conversation — five writers assembled to discuss these superhero-saturated times we live in. Beware: This article contains spoilers. What a superhero movie could be wasn’t clear when “Iron Man” kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008. Now with “Avengers: Endgame” concluding the saga — at least for now — we know that it can be about everything from friendships to political debates and issues of representation, all while saving the world, of course. We asked five people who cover pop culture for The Times — Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, chief film critics; Wesley Morris, critic at large; Kyle Buchanan, pop culture reporter; and Aisha Harris, assistant TV editor — about the M.C.U. legacy and how it’s changed Hollywood and us. Here are excerpts from the conversation. STEPHANIE GOODMAN [What to read if you want more Avengers. | How the movie did in Week 2 at the box office.] KYLE BUCHANAN Coming after “Infinity War,” which had little downtime, the most appealing parts of “Endgame” were the scenes where the heroes weren’t thinking about how to save the world because they had already tried and failed. Now, they just had to adjust. Honestly, “Endgame” reminded me in several moments of a Richard Linklater film: It has that same intense preoccupation with time, there’s long scenes where people are just hanging out, and there are a whole bunch of startlingly likable jocks. A.O. SCOTT There’s an element of these movies that is basically a workplace sitcom. It’s about a bunch of people who — whatever their different temperaments and personalities — all have to get along and work together. And a lot of the conflicts in these movies are kind of personnel and H.R. issues as much as they are battles against cosmic evil. BUCHANAN It’s a superheroic version of “The Office.” You’ve got Chris Evans as John Krasinski and Robert Downey Jr. as Steve Carell. MANOHLA DARGIS I think that’s true. They’re also successors to the western. It’s a group of people, whether they’re in a wagon circle or not, who come together and fight some enemy. And now, the frontier, as “Star Trek” told us so long ago, is out there. But I miss horses. There is a really awesome horse in this. I would have watched that rider and that horse for an hour. SCOTT I felt like that was almost worth the price of the ticket — it’s Tessa Thompson [as Valkyrie] on a flying horse! AISHA HARRIS I come into this entire cinematic universe as a very apathetic viewer — to me they all kind of blend together. But I could recognize if you were a fan, you would love this movie, and I think that is what these movies have become: fan service. And I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. I appreciate that this film seems to have satisfied at least the people who were in my screening. I’m happy that people are happy. SCOTT I take a slightly more sinister view of the whole fan question. It’s about fan service but it’s also about fan recruitment in a way. And about the creation of entertainment as obedience — you’ll go to these things and you’ll like these things. The whole logic of this franchise shell game is that you’re never quite satisfied with any particular movie because the point is you have to be sucked into the whole thing. DARGIS What we started to see with the Marvel Universe is that you’re either on board or you’re a traitor. There is very little room to have any skepticism or say, wow, this Marvel movie’s kind of like the last three that I saw. HARRIS I think that it’s good that “nerds” have their day now. Things that people used to get made fun of for 20, 30 years ago now everyone loves and accepts that it’s cool. It makes me feel sad about other types of genres that do not get taken nearly as seriously, whether it’s the rom-com, as Wesley recently wrote about, or Netflix’s “chick flicks.” I wish that fans who took those sorts of genres seriously were seen as viable viewers for the Hollywood studios to make movies for, as they have done with this franchise. WESLEY MORRIS Everything you guys are saying is true about the way that these movies are made for fans. But I also wonder, what wrong could these movies do that would alienate those people? For instance, making Tessa Thompson Valkyrie — there was probably a moment where people would have flipped out and objected to that casting choice. Or making any aspect of Asgard even remotely brown. DARGIS Or making women more powerful because really the thing I disliked the most intensely about this newest movie is that one scene ... [Pepper Potts, Shuri, and basically every other woman in the Marvel-verse rally to aid Captain Marvel.] MORRIS It’s ladies’ night for 30 seconds. Let’s get all your favorites. Women, come on down! As disgusted as I was by the attempt to spackle over a problem that that scene does, I also felt weirdly exhilarated by it. And the thing that made me mad was that it was only there as a form of lip service and the shot went nowhere. HARRIS Nowhere. MORRIS But in that moment you have eight women who assemble to help another woman. Some of them have Oscars. Some of them deserve Oscars. If you got those women together to do any other kind of movie, without the stuff of the Marvel apparatus, I would give my whole paycheck to watch that movie. BUCHANAN That scene is obviously trying to set up some sort of future Ladies of Marvel spinoff, but for me the most exciting moment was when Thanos head-butts Brie Larson and she’s unfazed. I found that weirdly powerful to watch. DARGIS I find it cynical — one after another of these movies where it was basically all the Avengers and Scarlett Johansson in her tight little suit. BUCHANAN The superhero genre is now so dominant in Hollywood that when we talk about screen representation, a big chunk of that is who is represented in superhero movies. “Black Panther” and “Captain Marvel” have opened the floodgates somewhat, although I hesitate to call them floodgates yet. Maybe they've opened a few doors. SCOTT Turned the faucet on slightly. BUCHANAN Chloé Zhao is going to direct the upcoming Marvel movie ""The Eternals"" with Angelina Jolie and Kumail Nanjiani, and I've heard one of the coleads is a gay superhero. And that’s going to be a weirdly powerful thing for me to watch in a blockbuster like this, to see a gay character presented in that way, knowing that this is the dominant movie genre and will be exported throughout the world. SCOTT “Avengers,” in a way, depoliticizes the old comic book series, and blunts some of the interesting psychological and existential aspects of the characters. Take Spider-Man in the Sam Raimi movies — it’s a really interesting character study, and it’s asking, how would it feel, in the middle of adolescence, to undergo this? Those movies felt tethered to reality in a way. Once the military-industrial-Avengers complex took over with “Iron Man,” then a lot of that interesting texture and politics and psychology gets smoothed over, and we get a much more streamlined and carefully blunted corporate product. DARGIS Think about who Iron Man is, though. This billionaire industrialist ingenious inventor — in weapons manufacturing. This has been the lead Avenger. That says a lot. BUCHANAN I do hasten to point out that Captain America could have been an always-side-with-might character, but in most of his movies he questions his orders and, in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” dismantles the idea of pre-emptive war. DARGIS The United States has been at war how many years now? And we’ve had these long-running movies that are just war movies, again and again. Yes, they are overtly depoliticized, but they certainly are political in another way. Each movie’s a justification of war. BUCHANAN That’s sort of what I found most disarming and charming about “Endgame” — it feels the least like a war movie of any of the Avengers films. It opens with them vanquishing Thanos but that doesn’t necessarily bring them any closure or satisfaction. And it’s relatively light on battle scenes, which is astounding given that this is a three-hour culmination of more than 20 separate action movies. There’s a giant one at the end and that’s about it. DARGIS But it still is building slowly toward that battle. I like some of the Avengers. I love a few of them. But another 10 minutes, another war scene. They’re war movies. I think that’s weird, certainly worth talking about. HARRIS To quote Donald Glover, “This is America.” I wonder if there’s a way to look at these superhero movies as an extension of the many ’90s action movies that were about intelligence and spies and anything that starred Harrison Ford or Nic Cage. Or even the ’80s when we had Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. There’s always been militaristic aspects in the way Hollywood makes action movies. This is just beefed up with sci-fi and fantasy elements. SCOTT These movies have always been about war, about combat, and about conflict. And it’s always interesting to ask who is fighting and in what cause, and how does that map onto whatever’s happening in the world? What this “Avengers” proved itself to be is an allegory of the global elite — this is the Davos class. These are people who kind of regard themselves as superheroic, tech billionaires. They’re our rulers and we’re their fans. BUCHANAN But I think that if you look beneath the hood, they’re doing interesting things within that framework. “Captain Marvel” becomes a movie about siding with dispossessed refugees. There are characters like Iron Man, who bear trauma and PTSD from their ongoing war. And “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” which, again, is not predominantly battle-focused, I think of it as the “A Little Life” [by Hanya Yanagihara] of superhero movies. Every single subplot in that movie is about unpacking characters’ traumas. To me, the battles in these films are just a pretext for the characters to hang out. DARGIS I think their hanging out is the pretext for the battles, but O.K. SCOTT The ethic and the aesthetic is fundamentally authoritarian. There’s an interesting historical correlation in the rise of these movies — which are within their worlds fundamentally uninterested in anything democratic, that promote a super-elite Ayn Randian idea of what authority and heroism looks like — and the rise in the real world of anti-democratic authoritarian politics. MORRIS Right. “Iron Man” had a simultaneously radical idea and an appalling one. That movie begins in the caves of Afghanistan. His company, Stark Industries, is responsible for making weapons for that war. That’s a very specific moment in world events. SCOTT And the arc of those movies is also a way toward this idea that we need to privatize wars. DARGIS He’s a billionaire who can save us. Does that sound familiar to anybody else? MORRIS All of those Chuck Norrises and Stallones and even Bruce Willis, all of those guys were working people who either came out of actual American conflict or actual working jobs and found themselves — either through convoluted screenwriting or very convincing social and political circumstances — embroiled in what we would call an action movie. SCOTT And a struggle against power. Whereas these movies are more and more on the side of the power. The character in the recent Avengers movie who is most like what you just described is Erik Killmonger. And the politics of what happens in “Black Panther,” which I think is best of the class, are fascinating because it villainizes and stigmatizes Killmonger. His death is tragic, but it’s necessary so that the energy of that radical struggle can be reabsorbed into this technocratic monarchy, which is Wakanda. And it’s interesting that Killmonger is identified with Oakland and Wakanda is basically the Silicon Valley of Africa. MORRIS Oakland becomes a protectorate of Wakanda by the time it’s over. HARRIS The interesting thing about the Killmonger character is the way in which [the director] Ryan Coogler and the other people behind it tried to have their cake and eat it, too. A lot of people picked up on that with the hashtag #KillmongerWasRight. Granted, he died. MORRIS He had to die. But I love that they made the choice his. It wasn’t T’Challa saying, well, the plot says you’ve got to die, Killmonger, so “bye.” He says, I would rather be dead than to live against my politics, even in a world controlled by y’all. DARGIS Right, die on your feet rather than live on your knees. MORRIS That’s a radical idea, too. That movie was nominated for best picture. I will never stop thinking about how radical an idea that was to have in such a movie. BUCHANAN In the first “Avengers"" movie, Joss Whedon had a deleted subplot that would just track a ground-level waitress as she reacted to all the big battles going on in Manhattan. Since then, especially as the Russo brothers have taken over, they’ve mostly moved the action to anonymous locations. If I had a major bone to pick aesthetically with the Marvel movies, it's that very few of them reach for the exciting frames and colors of a James Gunn “Guardians of the Galaxy” movie. During the climax of “Infinity War,"" Thanos does his fatal snap on the most anonymous stretch of grass in Wakanda. I would have killed for that to be an interesting frame. DARGIS That’s the other problem with these movies: the filmmaking. The filmmaking often does not rise to my level of interest. I liked “Doctor Strange"" because it’s fun and trippy. SCOTT And “Thor: Ragnarok,” I think. DARGIS But oftentimes we’re not talking about the filmmaking. We’re talking about everything else. SCOTT I think that’s partly intentional. I did refer to this as a monument to adequacy, and I think that in a way there’s a risk in having the filmmaking be too idiosyncratic or too witty or too visionary. There’s an interesting precedent in the Harry Potter movies, where among film critics and people who were thinking about these as cinema, everyone will tell you that the best one is “Prisoner of Azkaban” — that’s the one that Alfonso Cuarón directed and that is the one that stands alone best as a piece of cinema. For every self-identified Harry Potter fan, that’s their least favorite because it’s the weirdest and it doesn’t track with what they think the books are. That series corrected afterward and went in a fairly bland and manageable and accessible direction. And I think Disney and Marvel have very carefully done that from the very beginning. MORRIS Well, think about how many Hulks it took to get to Mark Ruffalo. One of the high points of the last 20 years of these movies was Ang Lee and James Schamus’s “Hulk.” You’ve got this amazing confrontation between Bruce Banner and his father. So you’ve got Eric Bana and Nick Nolte squaring off under intensely nuclear-oriented circumstances, and you’re thinking about metaphor of the nuclear family. But the stakes are so high. The whole movie is building up to that, and the filmmakers thought about the ways you can create the experience of reading a comic book while also being at a movie. Now, the effects weren’t as good as they are in “Endgame.” But I found that movie an achievement. BUCHANAN Back when I worked at Vulture, we would do this feature every year called Most Valuable Stars, and the fascinating thing for me was to look at poll data of how many people could name the stars of these superhero movies. You would have people who were starring in the biggest movies of the day — a Chris Hemsworth, a Henry Cavill — and people could name the characters that were being played, but not the stars. I think that’s particularly interesting when it comes to Marvel because those actors are so well-cast and able to bring something extra to these roles, but the superstars of today are those characters, not necessarily the actors. DARGIS The Spider-Man movies — because Sony kept rebooting them — show that, really, the star is the unitard, right? It’s the outfit, you can put whoever into that. And there will be other people who will be playing Thor, who will be playing Hulk. One of the things about watching this movie is that they’re all aging out. It’s time either to die or hang up your weapon. SCOTT I think it’s true that these franchises swallow movie stars rather than minting movie stars. But I think there’s one exception. And the exception is Robert Downey Jr., whose star is attached to this franchise in a way that none of the other ones quite are. He is the spark of a lot of this — he set a tone of humor and pathos. MORRIS He brought his persona to Tony Stark. SCOTT He brought all of his charm to it. What’s interesting, of course, is that what really is ending now is him. Tony Stark is dead. All those people gathered for Tony Stark’s funeral. DARGIS I was so much more taken with Chris Hemsworth. SCOTT He kind of stole it. MORRIS He was the person who by virtue of being in these movies has made the biggest impression on me, and he’s managed to take a lot of that charisma into other places. But do people want to see him do something that isn’t “Thor?” Do people want to see Chris Evans do something that isn’t “Captain America?” I don’t know. And the movies will probably never let us find out. Because they don’t make the kinds of things anymore that let people like Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans, and even to some extent Chris Pratt, do more than movie-star karaoke. DARGIS Or they do little independent movies where they flex their muscles and show, I can act, I can bring this scene. BUCHANAN I liked Chris Hemsworth a lot in Ron Howard’s “Rush.” I thought that was proof of his ability to give a movie star performance in something that wasn’t a Marvel movie. But people didn’t really go to that. SCOTT I think the perfect test is that each one of those Chrises should direct and star in a remake of “A Star Is Born.” That is the industry test for: are you really a movie star outside of franchise? That’s what you do. MORRIS To your point, do you know the biggest star in these movies that you never physically see? BUCHANAN Bradley Cooper. MORRIS Bradley Cooper is a genius! He is very good as Rocket and he never has to deal with, oh, that’s the dude from the “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. He still gets to be his charismatic, interesting, clever self in these movies. And he still gets to be Bradley Cooper, movie star. DARGIS This is the Disney-fication of the movie industry. Marvel, with Pixar and Lucasfilm, has helped Disney start to swallow the rest of the industry. 2008, the first “Iron Man” movie opens, Disney has 10.5 percent of the domestic box office. It’s at 26 percent last year. They are just eating everything. Disney conquered childhood and has now managed to conquer adulthood. SCOTT The one wild card, maybe, in this deck, is popular taste. In spite of all of the best efforts of movie studios and Walt Disney and other corporations, they’ve never quite been able to control it or predict it. It’s not inconceivable that at some point, too soon for the interests of Disney and Marvel, people will start getting interested in something else. BUCHANAN I think this is a genre that is here to stay, in part because there are so many other routes to go within the superhero framework — it’s a pretty flexible genre. Whether you’re O.K. with that is up to personal preference, but when Marvel hires a director like Chloé Zhao, who made the wonderful “The Rider,” for “The Eternals,” I have hopes that she can do something fascinating with it. MORRIS It’s been interesting to watch superhero comic-book movies, as a genre, evolve in terms of who all it brought into its world. In 20 years, these movies have managed to do more interesting stuff along those lines than 20 years of any other genre, I would say. They have managed to at least open to other executives the possibilities of what it would mean to have an entirely black-oriented movie — and I don’t mean just black people in it, but blackness as the core theme of the movie itself. Setting aside that gratuitous shot of those women in “Endgame,” nobody financially seems to have a problem with women doing two hours of superhero work in a movie. HARRIS Within the next 10 years the entire universe will be rebooted again. I can see a world where there is a new Captain America, but Chris Evans, even though he’s now 80 years old, will come back to help Anthony Mackie or whoever is now the new Captain America learn to take his place. We are going to see the same thing over and over again. I don’t think it’s the end — nothing ever really goes away anymore. SCOTT Aisha, you’ve persuaded me to take this opportunity to announce my retirement from film criticism. HARRIS But you’ll come out of retirement because nothing ever ends.",The New York Times
2019,‘Avengers: Endgame’ Muscles Out Competition to Maintain Box Office Lead,"The weekend’s box office totals laid bare the have and have-nots of Hollywood in brutal fashion. The No. 1 movie in the United States and Canada — as could have been predicted a year ago — was the Disney-Marvel juggernaut “Avengers: Endgame,” which collected roughly $146 million. Total domestic ticket sales for the all-star superhero movie stand at $620 million, according to Comscore. The film has collected a jaw-dropping $2.2 billion globally since arriving in theaters less than two weeks ago. [What to read if you want more Avengers. | Our writers and critics talk all things Avengers.] That left three new movies to compete for scraps. “The Intruder” (Sony) did the best. A thriller directed by Deon Taylor, “The Intruder” took in about $11 million, a respectable debut for a lightly marketed movie that cost just $8 million to make. Lionsgate, which has been suffering from a shortage of hits, with its stock price falling about 40 percent over the last year, tried to compete with “Long Shot,” an R-rated comedy starring Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron. Despite strong reviews, the movie lived up to its title, selling about $10 million in tickets. “Long Shot” cost roughly $40 million to make and another $30 million to market. Lionsgate said on Sunday that it expected “Long Shot” to find a broader audience over the next month, with the Mother’s Day and Memorial Day weekends holding promise. The studio is one of a handful of smaller ones that have been struggling as streaming services have moved aggressively into their territory — midbudget action-adventures, comedies and dramas. Lionsgate had held up “Long Shot” to Wall Street as one of a handful of movies that would signify a turnaround for its film division. (Another was “Hellboy,” which bombed last month.) The studio will try again with “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum,” which arrives in theaters on May 17. Another small studio, STXfilms, had an even gloomier weekend. In partnership with Alibaba Pictures, it rolled out “UglyDolls” — hyped before its release as the start of a franchise — to disappointing ticket sales of about $8.5 million. The poorly reviewed film, directed by Kelly Asbury and based on a line of plush toys, cost at least $45 million to make and $30 million to market. STXfilms had lined up more than 100 promotional partners, including McDonald’s and Walmart, to generate interest in “UglyDolls,” an animated musical featuring the voices of stars like Kelly Clarkson, Pitbull and Nick Jonas. STXfilms and Alibaba hope the film will perform better in China, where it is expected to be released this summer. An “UglyDolls” series is also in the works for Hulu. An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the voice stars of the movie “UglyDolls.” It is Nick Jonas, not Joe Jonas.",The New York Times
2019,‘Barbara Rubin’ Review: An Overlooked Filmmaker Gets Her Due,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. If the arts in America ever produced an equivalent to the revolutionary French poet Arthur Rimbaud, it might have been the little-known but extremely influential filmmaker Barbara Rubin. The title of her magnum opus, the 1964 picture “Christmas on Earth,” comes from a passage in Rimbaud’s “A Season in Hell,” and the groundbreaking extremity of her work — and the actual trajectory of her life — can’t help but evoke the 19th-century poet. The comparison is made several times in “Barbara Rubin & the Exploding NY Underground,” an informative and overdue documentary directed by Chuck Smith. The movie begins with the stark declaration that the most daring and uncompromising figure in the early ‘60s New York experimental film scene was “an 18-year-old-girl.” Rubin, whose family hailed from Cambria Heights in Queens, spent a portion of her teens in a psychiatric hospital. Her release entailed her getting a job; a relative arranged for her to intern with Jonas Mekas, the filmmaker, film archivist and writer who was the most significant instigator of underground film at the time. Featuring reminiscences and observations from a wide range of friends and critics (one of these interviewees, Amy Taubin, is both), the documentary sketches Rubin’s alliances with the likes of Bob Dylan, Andy Warhol, the Velvet Underground and Allen Ginsberg. Because, frustratingly, there appears to be no extant footage of Rubin being interviewed, the talking heads serve as docents through a life that has many corners of obscurity. There are also reproduced portions of “Christmas on Earth,” the work for which she is best known. It was made in two reels, one of which was to be projected full screen, the other to be projected as an inset of the larger frame. In the large frame are gigantic, probing close-ups of female genitalia; the action in the smaller frame depicts nude performers in stark body paint engaged in exploratory sexual activity. The movie’s provocation has nothing to do with titillation. It is something more simple: a demand to look, to see. That the demand, as blunt as it was, came from a young female artist in a milieu in which women were so frequently subjugated and discouraged is still startling; there’s a sense in which “Christmas on Earth” can be seen as not having had enough influence. While the viewer never hears Rubin’s speaking voice in the film, excerpts from her letters, read by friends, put across her frustrations as her larger-scale ambitions fail to come to fruition. Like Rimbaud, she abdicated art at a young age, having five children before her death in 1980, at 35. Her children did not participate in the film, only adding to Rubin’s enigma. Nevertheless, in part because of the mysteries it encompasses, this story feels complete.

2019,‘Battle of the Thermostat’: Cold Rooms May Hurt Women’s Productivity,"Trilobites In a new study, women scored better on tests they took in warmer rooms. It is a truth universally acknowledged — or at least, much discussed on social media — that a woman who works in an office is in want of a sweater. Office air conditioning is often set at a temperature that women find chilly; the resulting water-cooler debate has been called the “battle of the thermostat.” One study even suggested that because women have slower metabolic rates, the formula used to set temperatures in workplaces, which was developed decades ago based on the comfort of men, may overestimate women’s body heat production by 35 percent. A question that hasn’t been asked much, however, is whether temperature affects the productivity of men and women differently. In a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, researchers reported that at colder temperatures, men scored higher than women on verbal and math tests. But as a room grew warmer, women’s scores rose significantly. The findings require further confirmation under an assortment of conditions. But they add to a scientific rethinking of the spaces where we work and study, which sometimes have been devised with a limited set of physical requirements in mind. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The researchers asked more than 500 college students to take tests for an hour in rooms with temperatures between 61 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The students performed as many simple math problems (without the help of a calculator) as possible, and rearranged a set of letters into as many words as they could, within a time limit. They also were asked to solve a series of tricky logic problems. The temperature had no effect on the scores when they were considered as a group. But when the researchers split the data between male and female subjects, a clear pattern emerged. Scores on the logic problems did not vary as temperatures changed, but the math and verbal test scores did. “If temperatures are cold, men are much better than women,” said Agne Kajackaite, a behavioral economics researcher at WZB Berlin Social Science Center in Germany, and an author of the study. “So there is this gender gap.” She added, “But then when temperature increases, the gender gap disappears” on the math test, and women outpace men on the verbal test. For each increase of 1.8 degrees, women’s math scores rose by 1.76 percent. That difference might sound small, but it added up. “When the temperature was below 70 Fahrenheit, females solved, on average, 8.31 math tasks correctly,” said Dr. Kajackaite. “And when the temperature was above 80 Fahrenheit, females solved 10.56 tasks.” She added, “That is, female performance increased by 27 percent.” Do the findings mean there is some ideal temperature at which male and female abilities are more or less even? That’s a big leap to take from one study that exposed people to these temperatures for just an hour, said Dr. Kajackaite. “You don’t have much time to get annoyed,” she said. We are in our workplaces or classrooms for longer periods than that, and the outcomes might be different over the course of several hours or a full day, a question for future studies to address. The researchers did notice an interesting detail in the math results. As the temperature rose, women’s scores went up, not just because their percentage improved but because they were ramping up the number of problems they took on. Why might that be? “Females feel better when it’s warmer, so they can exert more effort,” speculated Dr. Kajackaite. “On a good day, you will try more. On a bad day, you will try less.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Become My Mom Again’: What It’s Like to Grow Up Amid the Opioid Crisis,"Call them Generation O, the children growing up in families trapped in a relentless grip of addiction, rehab and prison. “I’d be crying, begging her to stop,” said Layla Kegg of her mother’s drug addiction, “but she was too out of it to care.”CreditCreditAlyssa Schukar for The New York Times PORTSMOUTH, Ohio — Layla Kegg’s mother, back home after three weeks who knows where, says she’s done with heroin, ready for rehab and wants to be part of her daughter’s life. But Layla has heard all of this before and doesn’t believe a single word. Layla’s trust was broken long ago, after years of watching her mother cycle in and out of addiction and rehab. And now this latest discovery: “I found a needle in your purse the other day,” says Layla, seated at her grandmother’s kitchen table, her arms crossed. “And Mamaw found two more in the dryer.” A pause, and then a fitful tumble of excuses from her mom: she doesn’t know why the needles were there; they were only syringes, actually, and not needles; she was keeping them for a friend. Layla, 17, rolls her eyes and sighs. “It’s almost like you want me to be using,” her mother pleads tearfully, in a voice children more often use with their parents. “Everything I do is never going to be good enough, so what’s the point.” Five days later, Layla’s mother, Nikki Horr, is gone again. More than 20 years after the introduction of OxyContin — and nearly 400,000 opioid overdose deaths later — a generation is growing up amid the throes of a historic epidemic. Call them Generation O: the children whose families are trapped in a relentless grip of addiction, rehab and prison. Here in Scioto County, a mix of verdant farmland and old mill towns on the southern edge of Ohio where everyone appears to know someone who has struggled with dependency, 51 people died of an overdose in 2017. At one school, administrators said, four kindergartners lost parents to drugs, and a fifth to a drug-related homicide. Nearly two dozen young people across the county described chaotic home lives rife with neglect and abuse. They recounted begging their parents — who more often spent money on the next fix than on food — to stop using drugs. And they described finding relatives unconscious or frothing at the mouth after overdosing. The interviews were coordinated by social workers, educators and community activists, and for those younger than 18, church staff, their guardians or their parents gave them permission to speak, and were present in some cases. Schools in Scioto County, educators said, have seen a surge in the number of children born dependent on opioids or suffering from neglect, many with severe learning disabilities, some barely able to speak. Teachers told of tantrums, at times violent, and of chairs thrown in classrooms. In a nation where more than 130 people die every day from an opioid overdose — and in a region where the impact of addiction has taken a severe emotional toll on children — school is for many students a refuge; a place where they attend classes, but also have access to hot meals, hot showers and donated clean clothes. On Fridays, educators said, students can take home backpacks full of food so they won’t go hungry over the weekend. Still, school is only a temporary respite. Educators said that students growing up in families affected by addiction tended to linger on campus until the doors were locked at night, reluctant to go home. Some had returned the next morning and casually mentioned that a parent had died or overdosed the prior evening. And law enforcement officials described instances of children who were sexually assaulted, tied up or found sleeping on cardboard in houses littered with needles and dog feces. Last academic year, 28 middle and high school students in the Portsmouth City School District told counselors that they had contemplated suicide, said Beth Burke, a guidance counselor at Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, the county seat. “I spend a lot of time putting kids in ambulances,” she said. “They don’t want to live this life and they have no way out.” In many ways, Portsmouth High is like home for many of these students. They eat breakfast and lunch there, and modern classrooms and computer labs are starkly juxtaposed with laundry facilities. Many students frequently come to school wearing the same, unwashed clothes days in a row, so shelves are stocked with clean garments, along with fresh shampoo, bars of soap and deodorant. Yet some of the teenagers change back into their own clothes after the final bell rings and the last class ends, “because parents will take new clothes and sell them for drug money,” said Drew Applegate, an assistant principal. “We don’t live in a third world country, but some of these kids are living in third world conditions,” continued Mr. Applegate, who added that the neglect he has seen reminded him of the deprivation he witnessed two decades ago during a peacekeeping mission in the Balkans. “Kids out there are raising themselves to the best of their abilities,” he said. “The parents are gone just like they were in Bosnia.” Like many American towns ravaged by opioids, Portsmouth was once an economic powerhouse. Nearly a century ago, it was home to thriving shoe and steel industries and a professional football team. Parts of the town, which hugs the Ohio River and borders Kentucky, are tidy and maintained, flecked with 19th-century homes and more recently built McMansions. But much of Portsmouth is forlorn and frayed. Vacant brick buildings, their windows boarded up, dot downtown. The old Mitchellace shoestring factory is scrawled with graffiti that warns, “Beware of H.I.V./Hep C! We have it!” Nearby, women and men wander along the train tracks at all hours, offering sex for drug money. Billboards along the main highway advertise rehab services and the opioid treatment Suboxone. In Scioto County, long considered ground zero in Ohio’s opioid epidemic, nearly 9.7 million pills were prescribed in 2010 — enough to give 123 to each resident, according to official statistics. Over the years, as opioid prescriptions have fallen, many drug users have moved on to heroin and fentanyl. A look at how opioids hijack the brain, from temptation and tolerance to relapse and recovery. Today, Scioto County, where the per capita income in 2017 was $22,586, has the state’s highest rates of Medicaid recipients diagnosed with opioid addiction and newborns suffering from the opioid-withdrawal condition known as neonatal abstinence syndrome. With Ohio’s state spending on child welfare the lowest in the nation, social workers in the county say they have felt the strain. In April, more than 220 children in Scioto County were in foster care, the majority of whom were removed from their homes because of parental drug use, child welfare officials said. Across Ohio, more than 16,000 children were in similar circumstances last year, a 28 percent increase since 2013 that has cost the state roughly $95 million in additional funding for the foster case system. Gov. Mike DeWine has proposed doubling state funding for child welfare, to $148 million over the next two years. Harrowing stories of living amid addiction spill out during play therapy sessions at school or in halting conversations with a sympathetic basketball coach. One recent afternoon, Christian Robinson, a lanky 18-year-old who plans to join the Marines after he graduates from high school, said his mom went to rehab when he was 11, but she relapsed last year on meth and heroin. She now lives in another city several hours away. “Mom has said that even us kids are not a good enough reason to stay clean,” Christian said. One of his sisters was born dependent on crack, he said, and a brother was born dependent on Oxycodone. “I’ve seen what drugs can do to a family and it’s not worth it to me,” he said. Amid the tumult, many children said they faulted themselves for not saving their parents from addiction. Others said they were made to feel guilty. “Mom told me all the time that it’s my fault she’s using,” said Cadence Nance, 12, a sixth grader whose mother gave her permission to be interviewed. A cheerleader and member of her school choir, Cadence has endured her share of emotional hardships. Three years ago, her father killed himself in a West Virginia hotel room as the police closed in to arrest him for murder. Then there was Halloween last year, when her mother overdosed at home while she was out trick-or-treating. Cadence said it took four doses of Narcan to revive her, an account confirmed by her mother. “My biggest fear,” Cadence said, “is I’m going to get home and she’ll be dead.” Not too long ago, Layla lived in a middle-class neighborhood with her half sister, Lilly, her stepfather and her mom. They sat down most evenings for dinners cooked by her mother, who worked then as a hospice nurse. “We always had everything we wanted and they made sure of that,” said Layla, an avid athlete who loves country music and dreams of becoming a nurse practitioner. But her mother, Nikki Horr, was secretly stealing bags of morphine and other painkillers from hospice patients who had died. Ms. Horr, 38, said she stockpiled the pills at home. Her plan, she said, was to sell them around town. That changed one day when, feeling overwhelmed at work, she began “dabbling in pills.” Drug use wasn’t new to her. As a teenager, Ms. Horr said she had snorted cocaine with her parents. In 2013, after hospice officials discovered she was overprescribing narcotics, she was given a drug test, which she failed, and was promptly fired. She entered outpatient rehab and stayed clean for a while. But after losing an appeal to regain her nursing license during Layla’s freshman year of high school, Ms. Horr said she lost her resolve. Distraught, she tracked down one of her sisters, who introduced her to heroin. “I went straight to the needle,” Ms. Horr said. At first, Ms. Horr left no trace of her drug use. But soon stray pills were tucked into sofa cushions and syringes were rattling at the back of drawers. Then one day, Layla, who had grown suspicious, peeked through a porch window and watched with horror as her mother wrapped her arm with a rubber strap and pierced her skin with a needle. As her mother surrendered to the drugs, Layla said their home filled up with filthy dishes, dog feces and strangers who came over to shoot up. She said she pleaded with her mom to go to rehab. “I’d be crying, begging her to stop,” Layla said, “but she was too out of it to care.” The addiction got so bad, both she and her mother said, and her mother’s nodding in and out of consciousness so frequent, that Layla became too embarrassed to invite friends over. For a while, they survived on money sent by Layla’s stepfather, who worked out of state for months at a time. In his absence, her mother began a relationship with another drug user, and more and more of the money went to buy drugs, they said. In the summer of 2017, the family moved to a shabbier house. The girls spent many nights at home alone, sustaining themselves on cans of ravioli and frozen dinners. “Sometimes I’d have to go without eating,” Layla said, “so my sister could eat.” Last summer, Layla’s mother overdosed on painkillers in a Walmart parking lot. She spent 45 days in rehab before abruptly leaving and resuming her drug use. Layla’s stepfather left for good, and her stepsister went to live with her paternal grandparents in another town. With her own father long out of the picture, Layla moved in with her great-grandfather and grandmother, Karen Alley, a 56-year-old stroke survivor with little sympathy, or patience, for her daughter’s addiction. Ms. Horr mostly stays with her boyfriend. At first glance, her grandmother’s house is the portrait of suburban calm. Wind chimes tinkle outside the front door, and the bedroom Layla shares with her grandmother is adorned with a photo of her smiling relatives and a poster of a tropical beach. But Layla said her life there has not been tranquil. She is crammed in with cantankerous relatives, a cat and a white Shih Tzu mix named WALL-E; tension chokes the house like a noxious gas. One recent night, Layla fled in tears to a friend’s house, where she remains, after yet another fight with her grandmother. More than half the members of Portsmouth High’s softball team have a close family member who uses drugs, and many live with their grandparents or a neighbor, said Kristen Bradshaw, the softball coach, who often provides breakfast before weekend games. For years, Layla’s love for her mother, plus her stepfather’s support, helped contain the anxiety wrought by the disorder of her home life, and Ms. Bradshaw marveled at the girl’s inner strength and her ability to focus on the field. But these days, with her family absent and no one to drive her to games, Ms. Bradshaw said the stress has taken a toll. “She’s at a breaking point,” Ms. Bradshaw said. “Her emotions are just out of whack.” Through it all, Layla has managed to maintain A’s and B’s — and a 3.8 grade point average — while playing center on her school’s basketball team. In softball, she ranks as one of her team’s top hitters. “School’s my happy place,” Layla said. Still, it’s hard to hide the constant dread and disappointment. Her mother has only seen two of her 24 softball games this year. In a recent conversation, Ms. Horr didn’t know that her daughter played right field for the Portsmouth Trojans. “There are times I still see the mom I used to know,” Layla said. “Other times I’m like, where did she go and when will she come back? It’s heartbreaking. She was my best friend.” In some ways, Layla said she has given up on a happy ending. She talks about going to college in South Carolina, where she can escape the maelstrom of love and fury she feels toward her mother. Nearly a week after she disappeared, Ms. Horr texted Layla during math class. Layla implored her to come home, and to enter inpatient rehab. Her mother refused, saying that she was sober, but was going away for a while. “I want to be nonexistent,” she texted. “You’re ill, you can’t admit it,” Layla replied. “Get help and become my mom again.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Better Things’ Is Pamela Adlon’s Personal Gallery,"Show Us Your Wall LOS ANGELES — Shod in the sort of boots that Sam Fox, her character on “Better Things,” locks in a safe away from her three grasping daughters, Pamela Adlon marches through the art-filled Los Angeles bungalow that is her office and stops before a canvas depicting a woman wearing a fetching expression and not much else. Ms. Adlon launches into the story of how she acquired the painting “Wine Fine” like a punk docent riffing in her own museum. “This is by an unknown artist in Detroit” — Brian Nickson, or BNick — “that I met right before I started shooting this season,” Ms. Adlon declares, fortissimo, in her careering delivery. “I bid on it at a fund-raiser and told them, ‘I’m going to hang that on the wall of my show.’ And I did. She’s in the stairwell this season.” That stairwell in “Better Things,” which wraps its third season on FX May 16, along with every wall, is crowded with canvases Ms. Adlon plucked from the sprawling personal collection in her Los Angeles home. There she raised three daughters after her divorce in 2010, providing the thinly fictionalized source material for her show, where she is the star, as well as the main writer and director. “I have a ton of stuff,” she acknowledges.Ms. Adlon initially lent the original paintings, admonishing the production staff, “‘You have to wrap these in fairy pillows and marshmallows.’ The last day on the set all the blood drained out of my body because these guys that I had never seen were stacking the art and walking out with it.” Thereafter, reproductions were used. “I saw an opportunity to put my aesthetic into the world of the show,” she said. “‘Let’s not just put gack on the walls that doesn’t mean anything. Let’s let it have some meaning.’” These are edited excepts from the conversation, which was peppered with a particular four-letter word. When did you start collecting? I’ve been collecting since I was 18. I’m friends with Allee Willis, the songwriter — she wrote “September,” “Boogie Wonderland,” the “Friends” theme — and is also an artist. I was her assistant when I was a teenager, and she said [pounding the table] “You’ve got to start collecting art!” You devote an entire wall to portraits by Phyllis Leece, your grandmother. It’s very powerful to have a bunch of one person’s stuff. She didn’t start painting until she was like 50. She experimented with all kinds of things: Van Gogh, Monet-ish. This is probably why I love figurative art so much, because I like the faces. Any unexpected complications using your collection? I have to get releases for everything [to avoid copyright infringement]. Like the piece that hangs behind [the youngest daughter] Duke’s bed — it’s all these little fabric pieces made into a quilt. It took forever to get most of those cleared. I was shooting a scene in Season 1 and I noticed there were stickers on this painting. The production designer said, “It didn’t clear at the last minute.” And I was like: “So you put (expletive) stickers on it?” In an episode this season, Sharon Stone comments on your paintings. Was that deliberate? I wrote a part for Sharon Stone because she’s a fan and just threw such love in my direction. We shoot fluidly and at the start of the scene she entered and was getting off on the fact that she was walking around the “Better Things” house and said, “Your house is so cool — I love your art.” I thought, Is this too much? And then I thought: (expletive) it, I’ll leave it in. You have two pieces by David Choe, the street artist, in the “Better Things” house. I bought a piece of his on the internet. Years later, I became friends with Dave and he signed the piece. Has your collection ever affected the outcome of an episode? This season, where I have a colonoscopy, I get a text that says: “Your test is clear.” I’m standing by the “Mistress of Doom” painting by Christopher Cuseo. The mistress is holding a raven and she’s got blood coming out of her eyes. I was standing there and I got the text and I thought — oh (expletive) it — and I high-fived the Mistress. And it was the perfect thing.",The New York Times
2019,‘Bigger Than a Party of Old White Men’: G.O.P. Women Seek to Replenish House Ranks,"On Washington WASHINGTON — While House Democratic women celebrated one of their best elections ever last November, Republican women lamented one of their worst. A solitary new female Republican representative was triumphant compared with 35 freshman Democrats, many of whom arrived with a considerable splash. Female Republican membership in the House declined by 10 to a total of just 13 compared with 89 Democrats. The Republican side of the House chamber became a sea of men. “It was a rough election,” Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said at a recent press luncheon organized by Winning for Women, one of the emerging organizations focused on electing Republican women. Ms. Ernst saw two male House Republican colleagues from her home state ousted by two Democratic female challengers. Still reeling from a monumental step backward — one in no small part because of women’s antipathy to President Trump — Republican women are trying to seize the first opportunity they have to begin righting their political ship in a special election in eastern North Carolina. Advocacy groups and female lawmakers desperate to elect more Republican women to the House are rallying behind Joan Perry, a pediatrician and political novice who in late April finished second among 17 candidates to advance to a July runoff with Greg Murphy. He is a state lawmaker who is also a physician. The winner of the fall general election will succeed Walter B. Jones Jr., the longtime congressman who died in February, in a district that solidly favors Republicans. The political arm of Winning for Women, WFW Action Fund, pumped slightly more than $200,000 into an independent expenditure that included TV and radio ads along with mailings on behalf of Dr. Perry in the first vote. It is likely to weigh in again with significant help before the runoff. In addition, Women Speak Out PAC, the political partner of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, spent more than $75,000 on voter contact in support of Dr. Perry. Just over 100 years ago, the first woman was sworn into Congress. As of this month, a record 131 women are serving in the Legislature. The New York Times photographed them. In the aftermath of the 2018 wipeout, those backing her say they are determined to demonstrate that their party is not just for men. “Republicans have historically had a problem electing and appealing to women; we don’t even need to look beyond the midterms to see that,” said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for WFW Action Fund. “Part of why we exist is to prove that this party is bigger than a party of old white men. But to get there, we need to make sure we’re doing a better job of giving women the resources they need to win.” It is not going to be easy to reverse the trend. The 2018 midterm elections showed a steep drop in Republican support among suburban women — typically a core group for the party. The electoral environment was bad enough that one group that advocates more moderate female Republican candidates encouraged those considering a 2018 race to defer, fearing they would be defeated and give up on politics when they could be successful in a different election cycle. A representative of Emily’s List, the 34-year-old organization dedicated to identifying and endorsing Democratic women who support abortion rights, welcomed the effort by Republicans to elect more women to the still male-dominated Congress. “We understand the challenges, we understand that it takes work and we are glad they are focused on it,” said Christina Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the organization. But, she noted, the effort to elect more Republican women faces major obstacles, particularly the party’s strong anti-abortion stance when polls show that most Americans believe access to abortion should remain legal in most cases. That divide is likely to be underscored anew by this week’s passage of a near abortion ban by the Republican-controlled Legislature in Alabama, a measure the Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed on Wednesday. “They are going to run into trouble because they are trying to do this in a party that is actively going after women’s rights and has actively dismissed women’s rights,” Ms. Reynolds said. To illustrate her point, Ms. Reynolds noted that at 13, the number of Republican women in the House is just one greater than the dozen who were serving when Emily’s List was founded in 1985. Ms. Perez-Cubas said her organization was focused on finding female candidates who are a good fit with the districts where they are running. Dr. Perry has made her staunch opposition to abortion a centerpiece of her campaign, but Winning for Women won’t apply litmus tests, Ms. Perez-Cubas said. “We want to see more qualified Republican women in Congress, so that might look very different in North Carolina versus in a place like California, and we’d play in both,” she said. “This just isn’t a centrist seat.” The primary cycle has proved particularly tough for Republican women because they can lack the financial backing and name identification that male competitors have, leading groups like Winning for Women to place a new emphasis on getting into races as early as possible. In 2018, according to the organization, 120 Republican women ran in House primaries. Sixty-seven of them were defeated. In Senate races, 22 Republican women were on the primary ballot, with 14 losing and eight winning. After moving into the runoff, Dr. Perry also got a taste of how male candidates can benefit from their connections when Representative Mark Meadows, an influential political figure from North Carolina who leads the House Freedom Caucus and has strong ties to Mr. Trump, quickly endorsed Dr. Murphy, calling him “clearly the conservative pick” in the race. Republicans say that the Democratic victories in 2018 show that female candidates can have distinct appeal, and that if they get the right woman into a race, they can be successful. “Women come across as very compassionate,” Ms. Ernst said at the luncheon hosted by Winning for Women, which is funded in part by the politically active hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer. Its membership has expanded significantly after it spent about $2.4 million in the last election cycle on campaigns backing more than 20 candidates, including Representative Carol Miller of West Virginia, the sole new Republican woman in the House. But given the real challenges, enticing Republican women to enter the fray in 2020 when Mr. Trump himself will be on the ballot could prove daunting and will take significant effort by those wanting to replenish the depleted ranks in the House.",The New York Times

2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 10: New Year’s Irresolution","Wendy’s reputation is on the line. Can she do what it takes to salvage it? “All is quiet on New Year’s Day.” Fat chance, Bono. U2’s wintry hit “New Year’s Day” may kick off the “Billions” episode it shares a title with, but Bono’s opening line certainly doesn’t describe it. Directed with verve and humor by Adam Bernstein and written by the series creators Brian Koppelman and David Levien — always a sign that the game is well and truly afoot — “New Year’s Day” has the feel of a turning point for the season. Nothing shocking or momentous takes place, but the air is electric. This, despite taking place on a traditionally low-key holiday. On a day when the rest of the world is nursing hangovers, watching bowl games or simply kicking back and chilling out, these workaholic characters are preparing for the fight of their lives. Or the fight of their year, anyway. (They do a lot of fighting.) The focus of the episode falls on Wendy, who has become the show’s protagonist since Bobby and Chuck declared a cease-fire on her behalf. Her license to practice is on the line because of her unethical handling of Taylor Mason’s personal information, and her normally professional facade is being eaten away before her colleagues’ eyes. Taylor sails smoothly through a mock medical-board hearing, augmented by Chuck and Wendy’s one-time friend Lonnie Watley (Malachi Weir). But Wendy flunks her practice session royally. Recognizing his wife’s dire straits, Chuck suggests a bargain: accept a suspension and probation in exchange for eventual expunction. When he advises her to take the deal instead of make a deal, though, the jig is up. Wendy knows now that he expects her to lose and has made face-saving arrangements behind the scenes. She suspects this is as much about his own convenience as it is about her well-being, and she sends him off. Her work husband succeeds where her real husband fails. Taking her aside, Bobby reveals the moment he knew she would be his partner for life. It wasn’t when she read the Riot Act to a roomful of grieving 9/11 families who were demanding that Bobby, virtually the lone survivor in his firm, immediately pony up the money he’d promised them. It was when, after defending him publicly, she told him that if he didn’t deliver, “I’ll kill you myself.” Loyal to him in public, loyal to a greater cause in private, willing to hold him to his word and call him on his mistakes: This, Bobby says, makes Wendy the ideal ally. It is also why, much as it pains them both to do so, he advises her to approach Taylor and simply apologize for what she did. Stepping out of the Taylor Mason Capital elevator, her dark clothing darker still in the low light of the closed office, Wendy does what Bobby suggests. Then she adds some ill-advised advice, telling Taylor not to be the vengeance-seeking creep that she and Bobby have become. That’s the moment that lets Taylor know, if there was any doubt, not to buy what Wendy’s selling. “Your apology isn’t real,” Mason says. “This, like everything with you, is now merely transactional. That’s who and what you are.” So Taylor makes a demand: Only if Wendy asks Taylor not to testify directly, laying bare the quid pro quo behind the mea culpa, will the hedge-fund genius relent. But even that gets weaponized in the feud. Taylor knows that in effectively forcing Wendy to decide her fate for herself, she will face a judge harsher than any medical board could ever be. It should be noted here that Taylor has experience on both the vengeance and self-judgment sides of the equation this episode. While Mason Cap plots to take over the No. 1 appliance supplier to Rebecca Cantu’s ailing department-store chain in order to stick it to her boyfriend, Mason Cap’s founder is confronted by its major-domo, Sarah, about, ahem, extracurricular activities with the company’s investor relations specialist, Lauren. It’s one thing for Mafee to be interested, but Lauren is Taylor’s employee. Is that the kind of hedge-fund hot shot Taylor wants to be? What of our other major players this New Year? Chuck appears to blithely waltz even deeper into corruption, cutting a deal with Treasury Secretary Todd Krakow to free up the funds needed for his father’s construction project. Bobby, meanwhile, hauls in both himself and pretty much every Axe Cap character with a speaking role on the holiday. He has pretexts for each: He has to help Wendy prepare; he has to defend against Taylor’s takeover of that appliance company; he has to come up with an appropriate tax-evasion scheme to offset the 18 fine art masterpieces he purchased on a whim at Art Basel; he needs Wags to deliver Joe’s Stone Crab takeout from Miami Beach; and so on. But he really just wants them to feel the same unceasing drive he does. “What’s the point of being rich if you can’t [expletive] enjoy it?” Wendy asks, before convincing him to send everyone home again. “I’ll let you know when I do,” he replies. (Wags, as it happens, was relieved of the expensive watch gifted to him by his dying father during his Florida debauch. Wendy hires, and I’m quoting here, “a professional cuddler” to soothe him. I couldn’t let this pass without a mention.) And then there’s Bryan Connerty, of all characters, who is faced with the kind of professional temptations troubling Wendy and Taylor. His wiretap of Chuck’s meeting with Krakow fails to yield the juiciest details. His underling Kate Sacker refuses to bend on her mandate to preserve the integrity of the probe. You know what that means: Dr. Gus to the rescue! The bowlegged bulldog of a performance coach advises Connerty to commit fully to his mission in the most over-the-top ways imaginable. Sample quote: “The kamikaze get a bad name because everyone wants to focus on the suicide!” So what should we take from Bryan’s subsequent decision to reconnect with his shiftless, bar-fighting big brother, a criminal whose safecracking skills can retrieve the Krakow deal from a vault in Charles Rhoades Sr.’s house? Is this, too, a suicide mission? And what to make of the similarity between Dr. Gus’s praise of Bryan’s commitment and Bobby’s praise of Wendy’s? Is she wrong to feel that Axe is more loyal to her than Chuck, who can’t even remember the moment he knew she was the one? To quote Bobby, I’ll let you know when I do. That not-knowing is what I enjoy most about “Billions.” Each episode is clockwork precise, doling out exactly enough information to get to the next step and no more. The arch dialogue sizzles in the brain, which is already hot from doing the work of trying to figure out where things are headed. And just when you think things are ready to boil over, you’re kept at a simmer for another week. You’ll get the dish you ordered exactly when the master chefs preparing it are ready to serve it. Knowing this show, I’m guessing it will be served cold.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 8: Raging Bulls","Billions This week, “Billions” staged a charity boxing match between its fake-tough traders. I’m surprised that it took this long for the show to get in the ring. The mano a mano match between Dollar Bill and Mafee on behalf of their overlords, Bobby Axelrod and Taylor Mason, provides the show with a perfect symbol. On the surface the fight is an act of philanthropy, a way to turn competition between rival firms into something productive. And surface is all it is. The perfunctory noblesse oblige of the match’s charitable component disguises the venal truth. Two rich men who can barely muster the strength to swing at each other enact an absurd grudge match while their colleagues gamble obscene amounts of money. The winning bet, it turns out, is on both competitors losing. On “Billions,” there’s always a way to make money off someone else’s misfortune. Meanwhile, the real competition takes place before the bout even starts. Wielding every carrot and stick he and Chuck could get their hands on, Bobby has induced the governor to reverse New York’s fracking ban. Having bet big on the energy sector, Axe Cap’s payoff will be huge. But the windfall headed Taylor Mason’s way is even bigger. Through two combative appearances on CNBC’s “Halftime Report,” Mason goads Axe into spending substantial political and actual capital on reversing the ban. Bobby takes the bait, hoping to hurt both the pocketbook and the public reputation of his hated rival. But by quietly buying up the rights to the water without which no fracking can actually take place — for a song, at that — Mason Cap has positioned itself to emerge from the fracas an even bigger winner. Bobby, meanwhile, is left to feel like a fool who fell for his former underling’s ruse, hook, line and sinker. “I see that taking credit for my success in the midst of defeat is a kind of balm,” Taylor sneers when Bobby tries to save face by saying he made Mason’s win possible. “So you go on ahead.” That’s gotta sting. (Helping his billionaire girlfriend, Rebecca Cantu, gain control of the department-store chain she dreamed about as a small-town kid soothes it a little, I’m sure.) Will Bobby learn anything from this? Certainly not morally. He’ll be more wary of tangling with Taylor head-on next time, the same way Taylor learned to be both more cautious and more vicious from the Axe-induced debacle that destroyed the Mason family last week. But the vendetta will continue, even redouble. It always does. Some characters even wage that war on spec. Consider Sarah (Samantha Mathis), Mason Cap’s major-domo. Given explicit orders to leave Wendy Rhoades alone, regardless of the role she played in destroying George Mason’s dreams, Sarah goes over Taylor’s head and sics the medical board on Wendy for ethics violations. Taylor learns of the maneuver directly from Wendy when they meet in the crowd at the boxing match. After a split second’s hesitation, Mason rolls with it, claiming responsibility even though it was Sarah who must have pulled the trigger. Sarah, whose admiration for Taylor appears to be more than professional, appreciates the retroactive blessing for the attack. Wendy, of course, is guilty as sin. She knows it full well. Pep talks from both Bobby and Bonnie bounce right off her. As would-be clients refuse her services, Wendy admits she’s shaken to her core about this — more so, even, than by her husband’s humiliating public revelation of their sexual kinks. That discrepancy is revealing in its own way. Sex, love and marriage are as important to Wendy as they are to anyone. But being stripped of her license to practice would be a direct hit on her deepest sense of self. Being a doctor matters to Wendy. Despite her shenanigans in service of her boss’s and her husband’s respective (and collective) schemes, she’s still Dr. Wendy Rhoades. Losing that honorific would call her entire life’s work into question. Kate Sacker is facing a similar internal struggle. Attorney General Jock Jeffcoat’s current bugbear is mobile voting. His reasons are unclear to the other characters, though suppressing the votes of marginalized people is a tried and true tactic for good ol’ boy politicians. Sacker has been a good soldier in Jeffcoat and Connerty’s war against Chuck. But her skin instinctively crawls in response. For his part, Chuck combines political idealism with his desire to stick it to Jeffcoat and pushes for a mobile-voting pilot program among the Cayuga Nation people in upstate New York. This same group controls the casino that helped Charles Sr. rake in big real estate bucks … and father a secret daughter with one of the locals, as Chuck learns to his chagrin. With the usual carrot-stick two-step, Chuck works with the tribe to get the pilot program greenlit. In response, Jeffcoat moves against Rhoades’s nominal ally, Commissioner Sansone. His threat to pull federal funding for the department’s crown-jewel antiterror efforts and various other programs is enough to convince the Commish to shut down Charles Sr.’s waterfront construction project. Thrust and parry, jab and dodge, et cetera and ad nauseam. Directed by Colin Bucksey from a story by Lenore Zion and a script by Alice O’Neill, “Fight Night” is “Billions” at its most crisp, brisk and brutal. The twists and turns and pop-culture quotes are sumptuous, and every actor seems to appreciate the theatrical vibe of the project — part Oscar Wilde, part Bernard Shaw — a little more each week. But the toxicity of the politics underneath it all grows stronger with time as well. Voting rights, minority rights, the health of the environment, the sanctity of various and sundry offices — everything we’re trained, as citizens, to care about — are playthings to these people. The message is clear: So are we.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 9: The Doctor Is in","Billions I can, and will, write quite a few words about “Billions” this week. For what really matters, however, five words are all it takes. Dr. Gus is back, baby! Yes, the preposterously macho performance coach played by Marc Kudisch during Season 2 has returned. It’s easy to forget now, but for a time, the good Doctor — the profane replacement for the then-departed Wendy Rhoades at Axe Cap — ranked right alongside Asia Kate Dillon’s Taylor Mason as the series’s breakout character. But after his unceremonious firing from the company, he all but disappeared. Meanwhile, Taylor rose to become the fourth spoke on the Chuck-Bobby-Wendy protagonist wheel. And now? Look who Bryan Connerty turns to after a chance meeting in order to reclaim his edge against both his bullying boss, Jock Jeffcoat, and his mentor turned white whale, Chuck Rhoades! Do I sound excited? Good! Dr. Gus is a filthy force of nature, and Kudisch plays the ridiculousness straight. At one point Gus sits quietly at a table by himself, working on a bonsai tree. He judiciously prunes it a bit. His final cut made, he pulls a “hey, not bad!” face. It shows his can-do attitude is no performance. He’s Dr. Gus whether there’s a patient in front of him or not. That’s the kind of fire Bryan needs rekindled inside himself, and “Billions” has a tight enough grasp on its massive trove of supporting characters to know that Gus is the guy to strike the match. Indeed, it’s a big week for smaller roles across the board, whether they’re regular cast members or recurring cameos. Axe’s goal this week is to help his girlfriend, Rebecca, take over the beleaguered Saler’s department store chain. To do so, they must fend off a rival bid for control by the team of Taylor and the all-American billionaire Sandy Benzinger (Richard Thomas). Meanwhile, Bobby is faced with an internal revolt over access to an elite internal Axe Cap fund called Flagship. The rebellion is led by the indomitable Bonnie, who learned of its existence courtesy of a psy-op by Taylor’s lieutenant Mafee. Chuck faces a similar two-front challenge. Jeffcoat and Connerty are strangling his father’s construction project, while Taylor’s complaint to the medical board threatens his wife’s license to practice. To gain leverage in a way that directly targets Jock’s oft-stated aversion to the stench of the city, Chuck reroutes a freight train containing New York sewage to a track outside Jeffcoat’s pristine West Texas estate and has it stopped dead in its tracks. If Jeffcoat and Connerty call off the dogs on Charles Sr. and Wendy, Chuck says that the train and its nauseating odor will move on. But when the quid pro quo offered by Jeffcoat and Connerty includes a demand to shut down the pilot mobile voting program, Chuck says no. Is it idealism that leads Chuck to this decision, which his wife and father will not understand if they find out? Or is it merely a desire to stick it to Jeffcoat? It’s not clear even Chuck knows the answer. As always, the plot (here devised by the writer Adam R. Perlman and put into action by the director Naomi Geraghty) is crisp, clever and layered like a cake. But recapping it gives short shrift to the Dr. Guses of the “Billions” world. This show gains so much of its character from its characters. It deploys them with the same precision and inventiveness that Bobby Axelrod applies to his trades. Take Benzinger, whom we last saw happily crushing Bobby’s hopes of buying an N.F.L. team. He returns here in hopes of purchasing the Chrysler Building and keeping it out of foreign hands, thereby burnishing the patriotic-billionaire image at the heart of his coming ghostwritten memoir, “American Champion.” He is also successfully, if briefly, wooed by Taylor Mason to help keep Saler’s, another American institution, out of Rebecca’s and Bobby’s sketchy little hands. But when Bobby outbids Benzinger for the Chrysler Building, the American Champion is forced to the negotiating table. And then a very strange thing happens. Bobby sells the building back to Benzinger at cost. He convinces Sandy to side with Rebecca instead of Taylor. He then resigns from Saler’s board so as not to cause any friction that would screw up her dream of saving the chain. But Rebecca insists that Bobby stay on the board because she values his insight and support that much. If this means losing Benzinger, and thus the retail chain itself, so be it. This “Gift of the Magi” display of genuine care and affection blows Benzinger away. He tells the two lovebirds that he’s now all in with both of them. None of this would work without Richard Thomas’s soft-spoken gravitas as Benzinger. Beneath his placid, cornfed looks, there’s a sense that his still waters run both deep and dark. That’s exactly what’s called for to make him both a convincing enemy and a valuable ally. And how did Taylor first get through Benzinger’s door, even if their deal was ultimately a bust? Lauren Turner (Jade Eshete), Mason Cap’s glamorous Wags equivalent, whose job is to show clients a good time. In Benzinger’s case, this means simply picking the Union Square Kellogg’s store as a nostalgic meeting spot for the man’s son and adviser. But the younger Benzinger isn’t the only person deeply impressed by the choice. Taylor yields to the sizzling sexual chemistry and has a romantic late-night make-out session in the street with Lauren — an employee, need we remind ourselves. The rest of the liaison is yadda, yadda, yadda’d by editing, but both Taylor and Lauren are determined to keep it a secret from Mason Cap’s other top dog, Sarah, whose own feelings for Taylor are hard to miss. The episode also features the return of Dr. Ari Gilbert (Seth Barrish), whose dirty deals with Axe made him a fall guy as the Chuck-and-Bobby war wound down. His jailhouse meeting with Rhoades, designed to draw Connerty’s attention, is rife with self-consciously over-the-top “Silence of the Lambs” references, right down to Gilbert’s Lecter-like pose when Chuck arrives. And this week was also is the biggest showcase yet for Sarah Stiles as Bonnie, Axe Cap’s new alpha dog among the young traders. In short order, she successfully gains access to the elite fund while freezing out all her ostensible comrades — directly at the expense of Dollar Bill, whom Axe boots from the fund because of his loose lips on the matter. Bonnie tops off her big week by … having sex with Dollar Bill in the office parking lot, simply to scratch a strange sexual itch for the guy. Dr. Gus would no doubt approve. So do I. Bonnie and Bill’s “If this van’s a-rockin’, don’t come a-knockin’” moment is coldly calculated, meticulously planned and wildly unpredictable. It’s “Billions” in a nutshell. An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a Kellogg’s store in New York. It is on Union Square, not Times Square.",The New York Times
2019,‘Black Leadership Matters’: Why a Racial Rift Is Growing Among N.Y. Democrats,"A progressive push, fueled by newly energized activists, has alienated the old guard of black leaders, igniting an internal battle with racial overtones. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] As big-dollar political donors recently gathered at a TriBeCa wine bar to honor one of the country’s most powerful black state lawmakers, protesters converged outside. Waving signs and chanting, shouting to be heard in the bar's darkened interior, they demanded an end to big money in politics. They were Democratic activists — and their target was one of their own: Carl E. Heastie, the Democratic speaker of the New York State Assembly. But they also had to shout over the sound of counterprotesters: an equally sized group of black community leaders, who had assembled to support the speaker and denounce the activists. The progressive movement in New York has been credited with overturning politics in Albany: The Legislature is now under Democratic control for only the third time in 50 years. But the progressive push, fueled by many newly energized activists, has also alienated some of the party’s old guard of black leaders, igniting an internal battle with racial overtones. Black community leaders have leveled accusations of paternalism. Black lawmakers have warned of a gulf between activists’ priorities and those of their constituents. Even black activists who are part of the insurgent wing have cautioned of overreach by white progressives. “People talk about how black lives matter,” said Charlie King, a longtime Democratic operative and a former senior campaign adviser to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. “Well, black leadership matters. If white progressives can’t respect that, they will be made to respect that.” Since President Trump’s election in 2016, Democrats nationwide have grappled with whether a new wave of progressive energy — fueled in large part by young people and well-off white suburban women — represents black voters, the longtime pillars of the Democratic Party. In New York, the debate has taken on particular weight. Black Democrats now lead both houses of the State Legislature, after years of Republican opposition. In the Assembly especially, black lawmakers have risen under Mr. Heastie’s leadership, as have those with ties to the Bronx County political machine that Mr. Heastie once led. Some of those freshly cemented power brokers are now bristling at the suggestion by newly prominent activists and elected officials that they have not been progressive enough on issues like rent regulation, new taxes on the ultrawealthy and campaign finance reform. They call such criticisms misplaced and racially charged, and they suggest that the activists do not represent the communities they claim to speak for. “What the driving force of this movement cares about isn’t what communities of color care about,” said State Senator Brian Benjamin, a black Democrat who represents Harlem. The issue came to a head outside Mr. Heastie’s fund-raiser last month, when progressive activist groups like Indivisible and Rise and Resist, which formed after the 2016 presidential election, organized a protest. Black leaders arrived to counterprotest. The dueling groups lined up on opposite sides of a sidewalk: the protesting activists, many of them white, facing the counterprotesters, all black. The activists “don’t look like us, don’t live with us,” said the Rev. Troy DeCohen, a pastor who leads the United Black Clergy of Westchester. “What they’re trying to do is co-opt what historically has been rooted in the black community,” he added, referring to the black community’s history of social justice activism. The new groups draw strong support in primarily white neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Westchester. Several of the protesters at Mr. Heastie’s fund-raiser lived in the West Village. Some of the candidates backed by the new groups last year, though diverse in race and gender, won significantly more votes in gentrifying areas of Brooklyn and Queens than in predominantly black or brown neighborhoods. Their rivals had accused them of siding with gentrifiers over poorer communities. But the groups also include members from diverse demographics; local chapters dot the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. They support racial justice priorities such as criminal justice reform and more school funding. They also work closely with unions and longer-standing activist groups that are well known for representing — and being led by — working-class people of color. “I was deeply offended by the suggestion that it was only white progressives,” said Jawanza Williams, the lead organizer for VOCAL-NY, which focuses on issues like criminal justice and homelessness. Mr. Williams, who is black and formerly homeless, helped lead the protest outside of Mr. Heastie’s fund-raiser. “It erases the struggle of black organizers who are progressive.” The protesters at the fund-raiser emphasized that their criticism was not of the Assembly speaker as a black man, but for the role they said he played in delaying campaign finance reform. ""What struck a chord was the hypocrisy,” Livvie Mann, of the group Rise and Resist, said of Mr. Heastie. Ms. Mann, who is white, organized the protest. “Days after the budget, he does a huge fund-raiser, and it felt like a slap in the face.” Kirsten John Foy, president of the activism group Arc of Justice and one of the organizers of the counterprotest, said he agreed with the need to get big money out of politics. But he took issue with the protesters’ tactics and their lack of diversity. Mr. DeCohen said black members of the activist groups had been “brainwashed.” He added, “We always call them the Uncle Toms.” Jason Walker, VOCAL-NY’s campaign director, replied that he was surprised to “see the black faith leaders take the playbook” of racial division. “As a black millennial and a progressive, I’m looking for my leaders to set up the next generation to win,” he said. Mr. Heastie, in brief comments to reporters as he entered the fund-raiser, brushed off the criticism. The political action committee for which he was fund-raising gave $50,000 last year to help elect more Democrats to the Senate. “History will show that the Democratic Assembly has always been the progressive champions,” he said. “That’s what people should be looking at, on the actions that we take.” The tension arrives at a key moment in New York history: Along with Mr. Heastie’s historic ascent to the speakership, Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins this year became the first black woman to lead the State Senate. Democrats had seized control of both chambers of the Legislature on a promise to quickly enact sweeping change. But the party has disagreed about what changes, when, and in what order. The $175 billion state budget passed on April 1 included major progressive victories, including limiting cash bail and releasing money for the city’s public housing system. The black leaders said those achievements should be celebrated, and suggested that campaign finance reform was a lower-priority issue. “I’ve never had one person in Central Harlem and East Harlem say, ‘Brian Benjamin, go to Albany and get me public financing,’” said Mr. Benjamin, the state senator, though he said he supports the idea. “They want affordable housing, money for education and criminal justice reform.” But proponents of public financing said getting big money out of politics would make other progressive goals possible. Ricky Silver, a lead organizer of the group Empire State Indivisible, called public financing the “tip of the arrowhead as it relates to all progressive issues.” Studies have shown that donor diversity increases in public matching systems. The Rev. Jesse Jackson wrote a recent opinion piece calling the policy a potential “game changer.” White activists also defended their right to criticize Mr. Heastie. “He, as the leader of the Assembly, represents the entire state,” said Paul Rabin, a member of the group Rise and Resist. Still, several black leaders who were not at the protest said that while they agreed with the activist groups’ goals, the groups should be conscious of how their actions might appear to observers. L. Joy Williams, the president of the Brooklyn N.A.A.C.P., said “optics and public perception” of the issues activists were fighting for could sidetrack their cause, rather than advance it. Jamaal T. Bailey, a state senator who represents the Bronx and Westchester and considers Mr. Heastie his political mentor, said Democrats should focus on party unity, citing lyrics from the Jay-Z song “Family Feud.” “Nobody wins when the family feuds,” he said. “What’s better than one Democratic majority? Two.” Even black activists who have been heavily involved with the new activist groups warned that certain voices should be careful not to drown out others. Sherese Jackson, who until recently was the only nonwhite board member of Indivisible Nation BK, an activist group in Brooklyn formed after 2016, said the group often discusses how to increase diversity. But the discussions had yet to turn into real change. “It is definitely a struggle as a woman of a color,” she said, “feeling 100 percent safe in a mostly white, progressive world.” Events such as the protest against Mr. Heastie, even if well intentioned, could further deter nonwhite people from joining, she said. “The visual alone — I could see how that could come across to people, and it could be a turnoff,” Ms. Jackson said. “This does not help the trust factor.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Black Summer’ Reanimates the Zombie Genre,"Critic’s Notebook The thing with zombies is that it’s hard to get rid of them: Even if you succeed in killing some for good, there are always more. That applies to series and films about the living dead, too. I’m one of those suckers who will watch pretty much anything involving ravenous corpses, and yet it was starting to look as if the well were running dry. And then “Black Summer” landed. If Andrei Tarkovsky and John Carpenter had teamed up to direct a zombie show, it might have looked something like this formally daring Netflix series. Stephen King, who knows a thing or two about horror, tweeted in praise of the show’s fundamental appeal: “Existential hell in the suburbs, stripped to the bone.” Then he doubled down with what some interpreted as shade directed at “The Walking Dead.” “No long, fraught discussions,” he wrote. “No endless flashbacks.” He added, in the same tweet: “Showrunners could learn a lot from this.” On paper, “Black Summer” is pretty standard. It is set a few weeks after something or other set off a zombie plague. The streets are empty. Military jets roar overhead. Survivors coalesce into small groups to better their chances. In terms of the walking corpses themselves, the main deviation from the usual template is that as in the film “World War Z,” the zombies in “Black Summer” are defined by speed. People turn instantly when they die, so there’s no window for escape. Zombies can run and some can even climb. And they have a single-minded focus on feeding: Once they’re on your tail, they don’t give up. Yet if the zombies are defined by frantic agitation, the show itself stands out from the pack thanks to a pensive, almost dreamlike economy. For many viewers, this aesthetic is frustrating (“why so sloooow?” is a common refrain in comments); for me, it’s hypnotically addictive. The series was created by Karl Schaefer, who was also a creator of SyFy’s “Z Nation,” and John Hyams, who wrote and directed many episodes of that series. It is nominally a prequel, but it does not share that show’s humorous bent . Plot lines are skeletal, exposition is minimal. Each episode stands as its own set piece. In Episode 3, “Summer School,” a group of survivors finds shelter in a school, only to end up in a “Lord of the Flies”-like social experiment. Episode 4, “Alone,” is almost entirely silent and consists of a realistically inept guy named Lance (Kelsey Flower) running from one location to another as he tries to evade a persistent zombie. The episodes are divided in small sections by chapter titles, which are sometimes cryptic and sometimes plainly descriptive. Following the subtitle “Dog,” for instance, Lance sees a dog on the street. He calls him but the dog trots away. The poetic, wistful payoff drops several episodes later, like an afterthought. Events happen at a deliberate, steady pace. Chases, whether on foot or in cars, can be heart-poundingly tense — it’s amazing how scary it is to watch someone creep through a seemingly empty building, no matter how many times we’ve seen it — but they are often interrupted by those chapter titles and are shot at what feels like a remove. When there is music, which is not very often, it’s usually a low electronic pulse. As for the characters, we know next to nothing about them. When we reach the obligatory scene in which people sit down for cold beans straight from the can, nobody gabs about life stories, missed loved ones or lost children. They just eat in silence. One of the chattiest characters, Sun (Christine Lee), speaks only Korean. She is never subtitled, even when she finally gets to deliver a big emotional speech. Ryan (Mustafa Alabssi) is even more isolated than Sun because he is deaf and doesn’t speak. What eventually happens to him illustrates the series’s most devastating philosophical bent: The world is stupid, cruel and, worse, arbitrary. In most post-apocalyptic shows, especially those in which the creation of de facto teams is key, there is always the sense that people are drawn together by fate; this inserts a note of hope because Americans are optimistic and trust fate to be somewhat benevolent. “Black Summer,” however, operates in a universe that is fundamentally pessimistic. People meet and are separated randomly. Death is a numbers game in which the odds are against you — even if you looked like a lead character. This approach culminates in a season finale that lasts just 20 minutes and juxtaposes two of the series’s signatures. One is the sense of despairing chaos and absurd destruction, illustrated by a surreal shootout. The other is the through line of ascetic simplicity, as seen in the very last scene. “Black Summer” concludes by tantalizing us with a potential second season — though a suitably radical move would be for it not to happen.",The New York Times
2019,‘Blocked Off From Civilization’: Floodwaters Turn Oklahoma Town Into an Island,"BRAGGS, Okla. — Flooding has turned a rural town in eastern Oklahoma into an island — cut off on nearly all sides by water. To get gas, people in Braggs write their names on their gas cans and a friend or neighbor makes a gas run by boat to the mainland. There are feed runs for people’s livestock, medicine runs, grocery runs. The power was just turned back on for many residents on Sunday night, and more than a dozen people — including children and the elderly — were evacuated by two of the Oklahoma National Guard’s Black Hawk helicopters. 10 miles Braggs Oklahoma Tulsa Keystone Dam Bixby Fort Gibson Arkansas R. Muskogee Braggs Oklahoma By The New York Times Since late last week, when storms flooded the Arkansas River, nearly everyone and everything that has gone in and out of town has been transported by air or by water. Floodwaters stretch for almost a mile over Highway 10, a main artery so submerged that even longtime residents have a hard time picking out landmarks. “We’re just blocked off from civilization,” said Carrie Ross, 35, a nurse in Braggs whose family has lived in town for years. Braggs is but one storm-battered snapshot of life lately on the Arkansas River. Oklahoma and Arkansas were collectively holding their breaths and watching the river on Tuesday, as widespread flooding and dam releases threatened riverside cities and put increased pressure on aging levees amid a forecast that called for even more rain. In Arkansas, the river topped two flood levees in Logan and Perry Counties, and shelters opened in Fort Smith, Ark. In Oklahoma, all of the state’s 77 counties remained in a state of emergency, and the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management reported six fatalities and 107 injuries attributed to the flooding and severe weather. The Army Corps of Engineers has increased the release of water into the Arkansas River from the Keystone Dam in Oklahoma to 275,000 cubic feet per second, hoping to keep floodwaters from overtopping the dam’s spillway. In Bixby, a Tulsa suburb of 24,000 on the river, where the National Guard is filling sandbags, officials texted an alert Tuesday morning: “As soon as residents believe the situation warrants, they are encouraged to evacuate voluntarily.” In Tulsa, the state’s second-largest city, officials continued to monitor the levees, but said the dam and the levees in Tulsa County were so far working as they should. “We are planning for and preparing for the flood of record, and we think everybody along the Arkansas River corridor ought to be doing the same,” the mayor of Tulsa, G.T. Bynum, told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. “While it’s high risk, there is not an emergency behind the levees right now. It’s a high-risk situation when you’re talking about infrastructure that’s being tested in such a strong way.” Braggs is usually a slow-paced town, home to 259, in the hilly country in Muskogee County nearly 100 miles east of Tulsa. It’s a place of farmland and giant catfish. Low-flying fireflies flicker in the night sky amid the music of the frogs. In the pitch-black countryside Monday night, a young man on a dirt bike pulled up to the edge of the flooding, unzipped his backpack and started fishing. Something that sounded like a gunshot rang out: Locals figured someone had shot a snake, which have been rampant in the floodwaters. But making do with so little access to the outside world has been difficult. There were not a lot of amenities in town to begin with. There is one gas station (it was out of gas but reopened Tuesday), a couple of restaurants, a convenience store and Donna’s Malt Shop — but no grocery stores. Because people here are used to a little isolation, and to keeping to themselves, Braggs has quickly adjusted to life as an island. Overnight, residents turned their boats into water taxis, giving people rides out of town to dry land and back. But just getting to the transit points to get back into town — makeshift docks where the floodwaters end at parks or on highways — takes time because of the many roads that are closed. After days of being cut off, frustration and anxiety are quietly spreading. Some residents wondered aloud why there have been few state and federal disaster resources in Braggs. And there has been another local controversy: One of the roads into town goes through a National Guard training center, which was not flooded. Yet the public had not been allowed access to that road. On Monday evening, Ms. Ross was at her mother’s house; her sunburned neighbors and relatives were gathered around the dining table, coordinating the logistics of Braggs life. Her husband, siblings and other relatives were out doing impromptu emergency response — ferrying people on boats or making supply runs to stores on the other side. Ms. Ross had to tell her boss that she could not report for work on Tuesday. She could get to dry land on a boat, but once there, she had no vehicle and no ride to get to the clinic. She and many others in town had not left Braggs since last week. “It could be a lot worse,” said Brinda Coleman, 60, Ms. Ross’s mother. “I don’t think we’re that bad off. We’re getting supplies in here.” Braggs is one of the communities in Oklahoma affected most by the storm, but the flooding for the most part only encircles it. Much of the town — about six square miles of it, residents said — is dry, though some properties on the outskirts were deluged. Most of the roads are open and clear. With the power restored, and the weather sunny at times, life has seemed deceptively normal. “Normally, you’re secluded,” said Shawn Cogdill, a neighbor of Ms. Coleman’s. “I mean, that’s just the way it is out here. So it’s not like any different. The only difference is, you can’t leave.” Pat Arney’s home is surrounded by water, just as Braggs is. “I’ll have a little island for quite awhile,” said Ms. Arney, 70, a Braggs resident for more than three decades who lives on the outskirts of town next to the river. The flood that people in this part of Oklahoma recall was the one in 1986, but Ms. Arney and others said the current one was worse. “We’ve got a lot of people praying in Braggs, and people probably who normally don’t pray have been praying,” she said. The Oklahoma National Guard is working with local officials to make improvements to a seven-mile stretch of road in neighboring Cherokee County that will allow Braggs residents to drive in and out of town. Capt. Matt Blubaugh, a spokesman with the Oklahoma National Guard’s Joint Task Force, said in a statement that Braggs residents were previously not authorized to pass through the guard’s Camp Gruber training facility because the connecting road in Cherokee County was impassable. “The Oklahoma National Guard wanted to prevent people from being stuck in an emergency situation, especially in an area with bad to no cellular service,” Captain Blubaugh said. “If the work on that road is successful and the road made passable, then Braggs residents will be allowed to pass through Camp Gruber.” Early Monday evening, Mike Ogle, 65, spent his Memorial Day doing what he has done since last week: using his boat to ferry people and supplies back and forth between Braggs and the nearby town of Fort Gibson. Mr. Ogle’s home in Fort Gibson was flooded up to the attic; he passed it on every boat trip he made to Braggs. People in Braggs have offered him cash for the rides, but he has refused it. One man brought him a carton of eggs as a thank-you, and it sat at the front of his boat. “It’s kind of an insult to take money,” Mr. Ogle said. “I had people show up at my house that I didn’t know that helped me get my stuff out. I put stuff in the attic, but it wasn’t high enough.” As the sun dipped low in the sky, Mr. Ogle’s ferry into Braggs passed smoothly across a surreal water-world. Somewhere under the water to the left was a neighbor’s hayfield. Poking out of the water to the right were little strips of metal, the tips of submerged stop signs. Residents were told it could take weeks for the water levels to drop, and the increased releases from Keystone Dam might raise it even higher. “It didn’t sink in, until I went swimming into my house,” Mr. Ogle said as he sat at the wheel of the boat, choking back tears. “I had to wear a life jacket, because it’s overhead.” Then he quickly dismissed his own problems, saying, “Other people got it worse.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Booksmart’ and How Hollywood Stopped Fearing Lesbian Teens,"Jokes about masturbation, crushing on a cool girl from afar, messy first sexual experiences, bodily fluids in places they shouldn’t be, porn in places it shouldn’t be. Olivia Wilde’s directing debut “Booksmart” has many of the moments we’ve come to expect from a gross-out high school comedy, except this time, the teenager on a merry quest for sexual discovery is a lesbian. “Booksmart,” a thoroughly Gen Z comedy that balances thoughtfulness and irreverence, confirms what last year’s raucous delight “Blockers,” among other recent titles, only suggested: the movie mainstream, catching up with television, is finally ready to tell jubilant stories about teenagers who happen to be lesbians. [Olivia Wilde talks about her directorial debut, “Booksmart.”] In the film we meet Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) on her last day of high school. She and her best friend, Molly (Beanie Feldstein), have been accepted into Ivy League colleges, and Amy hasn’t kissed a girl yet. As the two embark on their first — and last — night of high school partying, a driving force in the movie’s unfolding chaos is Amy’s crush on her classmate Ryan (Victoria Ruesga), a smiley, tattooed skateboarder. Amy is anxious about her inexperience, anxious that Ryan won’t like her back, anxious that she will embarrass herself — in short, she has the classic worries of a never-been-kissed teen. Add to that the question of whether Ryan likes girls at all: in an exchange that is typical of how comfortable the film is with the evolving way we talk about identity, Molly notes that Ryan wore a polo shirt to prom. “That’s her gender performance, not her sexual orientation,” Amy replies. Unlike several recent movies that follow a gay teen’s coming out (“Alex Strangelove” and “Love, Simon,” for example), Amy is not anxious about the fact of her queerness. She’s out to her parents, who are overbearingly supportive; she and Molly identify as sex-positive feminists. In “Blockers,” Sam (Gideon Adlon) and her best girlfriends make a pact to lose their virginity at prom. Attempting this with her male date helps Sam realize she’s gay, and despite her initial worry, coming out is frictionless (her dad has already realized she’s a lesbian), and loving (her friends react with squeals and affirmations). The movie’s last triumphant moment is Sam kissing her crush, Angelica (Ramona Young), on the dance floor. In this way, these movies reflect a decision that Dan Levy, the co-creator of the television show “Schitt’s Creek,” made to never include homophobia or bigotry in his series. In an interview with Vulture, he said, “If you put something like that out of the equation, you’re saying that doesn’t exist and shouldn’t exist.” Television has its own uneven history portraying gay women, including a trend at the turn of the century on shows like “Party of Five” and “Sex and the City” of introducing a lesbian or bisexual character, who would have a single, much-publicized kiss with a main character before disappearing from the show. But these days you can find thoughtful portrayals of teen lesbians on “Riverdale,” “One Day at a Time,” “Everything Sucks!” and “Derry Girls,” among others. Creating characters like Sam and Amy means figuring out how to weave several strands of sexuality — teen, female and queer — in a way that does not feel exploitative. Hollywood filmmakers have not been especially comfortable depicting desire that is either female or queer, and the teen comedy has long been a kingdom ruled by hormone-riddled straight boys. That’s why the space given to these lesbian teen protagonists feels like a breath of fresh air. For the last two decades, Hollywood’s fictional high schools have — by and large — clumsily lumped teen lesbians into two dehumanized categories: fetishized or feared. For the objectified lesbian, “American Pie 2 (2001)” set the tone. The film’s dude leads are spending the summer painting houses, and Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) becomes convinced the two women living in one home are lesbians, so he breaks in, hunting for “proof.” The women (who, in heels and short skirts, are presented as a male fantasy of what lesbians look like) arrive home to change, watched by three of the house painters who are now hiding in the closet. The two guys left outside describe the “hot lesbians” over their walkie-talkies, gaining a rapt audience of men (cashiers, truck drivers, police officers) whose radios accidentally pick up their channel. When the women discover the boys have broken in, they kiss and touch each other for the enjoyment of their intruders. In its assertion that lesbians exist for male pleasure, “American Pie 2” was just reflecting a mainstream contemporary understanding of what being a lesbian means. “Mean Girls,” released three years after “American Pie 2,” epitomizes Hollywood’s fear of lesbians. The beloved comedy, written by Tina Fey, feels like it belongs to a later, more progressive generation of teen movie (not least because it continues to be referenced by people like Ariana Grande and Hillary Clinton). But the central revenge plot is based on lesbian panic: Janis (Lizzy Caplan), so traumatized by a rumor that she’s a lesbian, becomes determined to destroy Regina (Rachel McAdams), the classmate who started the rumor. Janis is staunch in her rejection of feminized girl culture, wearing a suit to prom. In a different version of the movie, she could have an empowering arc in which she comes out and is accepted. Instead, by the end of “Mean Girls” she has a boyfriend, and the assumption that being a lesbian is both life-destroying and shameful remains uncontested. “Mean Girls” is far from the only teen movie to marginalize lesbians: “Bring It On,” “Sierra Burgess Is a Loser” and “Pitch Perfect” all have jarring jokes that laugh at queer women. As questions about representation in Hollywood entertainment have become more urgent in recent years, prominent lesbian characters have slowly begun to trickle into the movie mainstream. Of course, independent cinema has long been a place to find complex queer women, from “Desert Hearts” to “Bound” to “Pariah.” Mainstream movie culture, which carefully takes its cues from societal norms, is just catching up. Recently, we’ve seen lesbians on the big screen in a tear-jerker romantic drama (“Carol”), a girls’ trip movie (“Rough Night”), a twisted period drama (“The Favourite”), a classic period drama (“Collette”), a sports biopic (“Battle of the Sexes”) and a revenge thriller (“The Handmaiden”). The conventional high school comedy is not the only place you can now see nuanced stories of lesbian teens on the big screen: “The Miseducation of Cameron Post,” a wrenching movie about a gay conversion camp, “Hearts Beat Loud,” an earnest indie about a Brooklyn teen and her dad, and “Princess Cyd,” a coming-of-age movie, were all released in the last few years. (Honorable mention should also go to Netflix’s “Dumplin’,” whose combat boot-wearing, patriarchy-hating Hannah is lesbian-coded, even if she isn’t explicitly named as such.) In movies like “Booksmart” and “Blockers,” there’s no question we’re laughing with and rooting for our girls to get the girl. And why wouldn’t we? Seeing Amy and Sam’s crushes through their gazes is a delight. When Amy sees Ryan, the world goes into slow motion as a wistful Ra Ra Riot song plays, the camera cutting close to Ryan smiling into the California sun. When Sam gazes at Angelica, choral music plays and Angelica doesn’t walk, she glides, a vision in face jewels and a velvet cape. These moments are overflowing with longing, aching with emotion that feels both very female and very teenage at once.",The New York Times
2019,‘Boy Swallows Universe’ Follows a Gritty Coming-of-Age in 1980s Australia,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. BOY SWALLOWS UNIVERSE By Trent Dalton Hidden behind a sliding-glass door in a built-in wardrobe of Trent Dalton’s childhood home was a secret room, and a red phone. Dalton was 6 when the space was revealed to him by one of his three brothers. Many years later, he realized this was his family’s escape room. This incident is recounted as fiction in Dalton’s debut novel, “Boy Swallows Universe.” His three brothers are embodied in one — a mute savant named August — and Dalton’s alter ego is the 12-year-old Eli Bell. The fabricated setting is the same as his biographical one: a suburb of Brisbane, the sprawling city in the eastern Australian state of Queensland. Eli’s mother, like Dalton’s, is a drug addict who is romantically involved with a career criminal. Lyle is a second-tier heroin dealer, which explains the escape room. (Dalton and his mother agree the book is a “50-50” mix of fact and fantasy.) Dalton is a celebrated magazine journalist in Australia, known for his lyrical prose, so it comes as a shock to learn of the sometimes brutal circumstances in which he was raised. This coming-of-age story begins in 1985 and ends a few years later with Eli’s budding career as a newspaper reporter. In between, while seeking to avenge a murder, Eli infiltrates a women’s prison on Christmas Day, uncovers an organized crime syndicate and falls in love with an older woman. Yet while there’s plenty of action, and much of it suspenseful, this is not a straightforward crime caper. The red phone comes to play an important role: In a streak of magical realism, a mysterious voice on the other end of the receiver dispenses cryptic yet prescient advice to Eli. Somehow this device is not annoying. Eli is, in his own words, “a rolling tumbleweed of confusion and despair,” and the phone is a tool by which his mind makes sense of trauma. Like all children, Eli must live with the consequences of decisions made by others. His father, who tried to drive him and August off the road when they were little boys, is largely absent, or else consumed by alcohol-fueled rage. His mother is frequently out of it. All this sounds grim. But Eli, who notices everything and speaks in a kind of hyperactive journalese, is still somehow open to the world, and frequently amusing as a result. His prized possession is an Atari games console bought from a classified ad placed by a family “who had recently purchased a Commodore 64 desktop computer and no longer needed their Atari, which they sold to us for $36.” The anxieties of adolescence are persuasively conveyed — the big ones, like drug dealing, but also the more trivial ones, like talking to girls. One can’t help quibbling that the story seems designed with an eye to its own presumed dramatic adaptation. (Dalton’s résumé includes a few screenplays.) The violence is occasionally too much. Toward the end, a plot point involving severed limbs is downright fanciful. Such florid unpleasantries feel all the more gratuitous because the most compelling aspects of “Boy Swallows Universe” come from real life. Eli’s constant companion happens to be a historical figure: the legendary Australian prison escapee Arthur “Slim” Halliday, who was convicted of murdering a cabdriver in the ’50s, but always maintained his innocence. Later in life, he became a friend of the Dalton family. Early in the novel Halliday teaches the teenage Eli a lesson he will never forget: “An adult mind can take an adult man anywhere he wants to go.” If that scene is even partly true to life, the reader has much to thank Slim for. In this thrilling novel, Trent Dalton takes us along for the ride.",The New York Times
2019,‘Brightburn’ Review: What if He Doesn’t Use His Powers for Good?,"A superhero only a mother could love, with Elizabeth Banks as his mother. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A Kansas farm couple is trying to make a baby. The spoons start rattling, the earth moves — but not how you’d think — and the next thing you know they have a son on the brink of adolescence. One night his bed starts shaking — but not how you’d think — and the next thing you know he’s out in the barn scaring the chickens. Also hovering above the ground, speaking in tongues, and throwing vehicles and people through the air. The boy’s name is Brandon Breyer. That’s his earthly name, anyway. On his home planet, they called him something else. Brandon’s resemblance to another young Kansan of extraterrestrial background, with an alliterative moniker and remarkable abilities, is surely no accident. “Brightburn” (the title refers to the Breyers’ hometown), is a superhero origin story reimagined as a horror movie. What if Clark Kent, instead of being grateful to the parents who raised him and a defender of truth, justice and the American way, had been a power-hungry sociopath whose motto was “take the world”? It seems plausible. Skinny, smart and easily picked on at school, Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) comes to believe that he’s not simply special, but “superior.” Finding less and less reason to play along with the pathetic human creatures who never understood him in the first place, he devises ever more elaborate and bloody ways of messing with them. The soundtrack hums with deep, tooth-rattling vibrations and the prairie sky is full of portents. It’s scary whenever you see the kid on screen, and even scarier when you don’t. The gore and the scares work pretty well. The director, David Yarovesky, and the screenwriters, Mark Gunn and Brian Gunn, hit the genre beats cleanly and efficiently. What makes “Brightburn” a little better than average is the time it spends observing Brandon with Tori and Kyle, his loving, increasingly alarmed mom and dad, who are played with excellent game faces by Elizabeth Banks and David Denman. Before the bodies start piling up, they act as if they’re in a dark, perverse comedy about parenthood. What happens when your sweet little child starts acting weird and doing things you don’t understand, like filling notebooks with creepy drawings and disappearing in the middle of the night? “He’s not our son, he’s some thing we found in the woods,” Kyle shouts at Tori at an especially stressful moment. It feels that way sometimes. You get through it. Or not. I don’t know if “Brightburn” will be the start of a franchise, but I kind of hope so. Not that I’m necessarily rooting for this humorless little dude with a knit mask and a dumb logo to grow big muscles, acquire sidekicks and all the rest. It’s about time that someone understood superheroism as a dangerous pathology. What I mean is: It’s much too late. Rated R. A wave of mutilation. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes.

2019,‘Call Me a Science Fiction Writer. I’ll Come to Your House and Nail Your Pet’s Head to a Coffee Table.’,"Inside the List Ian McEwan’s new novel, “Machines Like Me” — set in an alternative past, and grappling with issues surrounding artificial intelligence — debuts on the list this week at No. 10. If “Machines Like Me” sounds like the stuff of science fiction, well, it is, and McEwan recently touched off a firestorm when he dismissed the genre in an interview with The Guardian. “There could be an opening of a mental space for novelists to explore this future,” he said, “not in terms of traveling at 10 times the speed of light in antigravity boots, but in actually looking at the human dilemmas of being close up to something that you know to be artificial but which thinks like you.” Later, he told The Associated Press that “Machines Like Me” was “an old-fashioned novel about an ethical problem pushed on us by technology.” The sci-fi community began calling out McEwan’s genre snobbery on Twitter and in opinion pieces. “It is as absurd for McEwan to claim he’s not writing sci-fi as it is for him to imply that sci-fi is incapable of approaching these themes interestingly,” said one. “Alternative history and nonhuman consciousness are established sci-fi motifs.” Another wrote, “Anyone is entitled to try out ideas. What you can’t do is write a detective story and think ‘the butler did it’ is a world-first clever twist.” As Dwight Garner noted in his review of “Machines Like Me,” “people are touchy about genre.” Kurt Vonnegut famously complained that he was “a soreheaded occupant of a file drawer labeled ‘science fiction’ … and I would like out, particularly since so many serious critics regularly mistake the drawer for a urinal.” And Harlan Ellison once said, “Call me a science fiction writer. I’ll come to your house and I’ll nail your pet’s head to a coffee table. I’ll hit you so hard your ancestors will die.” John Sandford’s series starring the Minnesota detective Lucas Davenport began in 1989 with “Rules of Prey,” and the 29th installment, “Neon Prey,” enters the list this week at No. 2. On his website, Sandford writes that although he plans to wrap up the series soon, nothing bad will happen to Davenport: “My editor has told me that it would kill sales of the back stock.” [ “I’ll no longer buy a novel with ‘Girl’ in the title”: Read John Sandford’s By the Book ] Nothing bad has happened to Sandford, either, though rumors of his death have been popping up ever since his fellow suspense novelist Lawrence Sanders died in 1998. “The names were close enough that it caused some confusion,” Sandford says. “In 2005, Christian minister and author John A. Sanford died, and the rumors started again.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Camp’ at the Met, as Rich as It Is Frustrating","Art Review This year’s Costume Institute exhibition is finally here. Will it help you better define camp? Probably not. But the historical journey is thoroughly engaging. In March 2018 the designer Rei Kawakubo held a Comme des Garçons show in Paris dedicated to the subject of camp, and sparked by Susan Sontag’s 1964 essay “Notes on ‘Camp.’” Ms. Kawakubo, who is famous for issuing one-sentence koans to elucidate her work (or make it even more mysterious), was rendered uncharacteristically verbose by the subject, sending out a multi-paragraph missive on the show beforehand. It turns out she is not the only fashion figure tantalized, inspired and bamboozled by camp. Andrew Bolton, the curator in charge of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, had introduced Ms. Kawakubo to the Sontag essay — which itself contains 58 different definitions of the term, and served to bring it from the underground into the mainstream — when he was creating an exhibition of the designer’s work. Now the fruits of Mr. Bolton’s obsession are on view for all to see in “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” the latest iteration of the Met’s annual spring blockbuster fashion show. A subject that at first seems obvious, camp is a densely layered sensibility that encompasses (among other things) the revivifying and subversive power of the extreme, artificial, performative and pastiche, often challenges established norms of “good behavior” or “good taste” (feh! with the good taste) and is deeply intertwined with the history of queer culture. A historical, cultural and sartorial journey traced in 250 objects of which there are 170 garments, the show begins with the concept “se camper” (“to flaunt” or “to posture”), and exists formally in two parts. The first half evolves through four eras — Versailles, Oscar Wilde, Christopher Isherwood, Susan Sontag — which connect individuals and their camp points of view with their expression in written and decorative arts. Section two addresses the multiplicity of meanings of camp today, as illustrated by a multitude of looks straight from contemporary runways: feathered, Freudian, elegant and over-the-top. It is grounded in the written word, bathed in Jordan almond shades, and proof that the more you consider camp, the more slippery, confounding and absorbing it becomes. Or so it became clear when Roberta Smith, The Times’s co-chief art critic, and I sat down to compare our own notes on “Camp.” These are edited excerpts from our conversation. VANESSA FRIEDMAN In the weeks leading up to this show, I had endless debates with friends and colleagues about the meaning of “Camp,” always without a resolution. And I was hoping, perhaps delusionally, that I would come away from the exhibition with a clearer answer — at least as it applies to the current age. ROBERTA SMITH I also had high hopes for this show, without quite knowing what I was hoping for. I reread Sontag, and by the end, despite her brilliance in identifying it, she makes camp seem fairly large and elastic — and it’s become only more so. Also there’s the issue of being outdated in terms of contemporary culture. FRIEDMAN The justification for doing this now, in an institution like the Met, seems to be that in periods of great divisions and dissent, camp, with its multiple interpretations and exaggerated aesthetic, rises to the fore. Camp also functions as a safe space for marginalized groups to engage in self-expression and cultural commentary. Yet I did not feel, looking at the clothes — even the Viktor & Rolf meme-bait tulle bombs that I just saw on the runway in January — that what I was seeing was a visual expression of this moment. Though I did get a sense of its place in a historical and artistic tradition. SMITH What would Sontag have cited as camp today, when we seem to be up to our necks in it? Still, even before rereading “Notes on ‘Camp,’” a thumb-through of the show’s lavish if cumbersome catalog excited me. It raised two very art-specific ideas. First, that camp begins with the invention of the contrapposto pose — one hip thrust out, elbow cocked — in Greek sculpture, which seems brilliant, as well as apt because of the Greek acceptance of love between men. Second, there was the notion that the Pre-Raphaelite painters were camp — innocent or inadvertent camp, according to Sontag. This idea made me much more sympathetic to the excess and overt displays of skills of these artists, although I’m not sure how they would have taken it. So I expected the show to shake me up. But once beyond the historical material, it looked surprisingly predictable and not very coded, either. FRIEDMAN Funny, I also thought the beginning was by far the most compelling section. I loved seeing that little bronze classical nude of Belvedere Antinous from 1630 (attributed to Pietro Tacca) in the entrance gallery with the Mapplethorpe photo of the marble Antinous from 1987, the Vivienne Westwood tights with the mirrored olive leaf over the crotch and the photograph from Hal Fischer’s 1977 “Gay Semiotics.” All of these male nudes have their elbows cocked out from one hip in that classic exaggerated pose of “se camper.” That, to me, was a powerful argument for camp as a cultural through-line. SMITH To me, the first half has three distinct parts — a long opening section devoted to pre-Sontag historical material, Sontagian camp and what the Met calls “Failed Seriousness.” They pull you in different directions, and build anticipation before the letdown or onslaught of the second half. It starts out dense, carefully structured and richly textured. Cross references abound among paintings, prints, letters, books and photographs. Gender is very much up for grabs. I loved learning about the Chevalier d’Eon (1728-1810), a French soldier and diplomat who lived openly as a woman in Britain, becoming something of a celebrity. The photographs and manuscripts pertaining to Wilde are also very affecting. FRIEDMAN In those early rooms, I stumbled over the camp side of things as it related to fashion. For example, the intricate peacock-feathered Aubrey Beardsley cover illustration for the English edition of Wilde’s “Salomé” was juxtaposed with a gorgeous black cape by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen embroidered in brass bullion peacocks — which doesn’t strike me as particularly over-the-top or artificial. Maybe theatrical. I had the same questions in the Sontag room, where the blush pink ostrich-feathered Balenciaga dress donated by Jayne Wrightsman was paired with the Cecil Beaton 1966 portrait of Mrs. Wrightsman in the dress (which was a fabulous call and response). So it is camp, presumably, because in Sontag’s time it was over-the-top. Which is useful for underscoring the fact that in different eras, what qualifies as extremism takes different shapes, but also adds to the general confusion; it’s implied, rather than overt, and tests the fall-back supposition that camp (like porn) is in the eye of the beholder: “I know it when I see it.” On the other hand, I thought the layering of Warhol’s screen-test videos of Sontag with the paper Campbell’s soup can dress and the Warhol Campbell’s soup can silk screen with the self-portrait of the artist was very effective. SMITH I especially like the self-portrait of Warhol in finger-on-lips pose. The Sontagian camp gallery seems very much about sorting out camp, just like her essay. What is and isn’t camp becomes very ambiguous. There are wonderful things here, all selected from the Met’s collection. They represent — or actually are, since Sontag visited the museum regularly — the art, artifacts or design objects that Sontag mentioned in “Notes on ‘Camp.’” About a dozen notes are emblazoned above the appropriate displays while the essay itself is flashed in a continual chyron “crawl” atop the displays, like an animated frieze, to the sound of typing. Sometimes it’s obvious, like the suit Schiaparelli designed with Jean Cocteau. The juxtaposition of Edgar Degas’s “Study of a Ballet Dancer” with two little pairs of porcelain ballet dancers seemed a camp moment unto itself. I’m not so sure about the lovely fennel-shaped Sèvres coffee service displayed in the Emile Gallé “Cow Parsley” Cabinet. FRIEDMAN It was that contextualization I missed when we progressed to the second half. The multicolored sweetie box of the fashion section was where the sense of how these clothes reflect the artistic expression or political tenor around them seemed to have been abandoned. The Christopher Bailey faux shearling rainbow cape for Burberry, for example, is a reflection and celebration of (and Pledge of Allegiance to?) the L.B.G.T.Q. movement, and is part of a blossoming of challenges to old gender stereotypes. But it resides simply with the artist Philip Core’s quote about Camp being “the heroism of people not called upon to be heroes.” What happened to the connections between the garments and the world — whether of art or culture — in which they were created? SMITH Well, they’re not there. With its double-decker vitrines, the show’s second half resembles a town square gone completely retail, a mecca for window-shoppers, except that the upper level can be hard to see. It’s also a spectacle in bubble, detached from reality — although a very wordy, noisy bubble, between the designers making statements about camp on the soundtrack and endless subject headings that turn every upstairs-downstairs combination into a separate category, and also a kind of illustration. “Camp,” the show, struck me as the most idea-driven, Conceptual, intellectual exhibition theme the Costume Institute has ever used. In the end I felt I was looking mostly at fashion one-liners. FRIEDMAN And it was not entirely clear to me whether the fashion served the quotations, or the quotations explained the fashion, or whether it depended on what you were seeing, and reading (and hearing — all those words being read aloud, plus Judy Garland’s final, cracked rendition of “Over the Rainbow” as an aural backdrop). My sense in a Costume Institute show is that the chosen garments have some extraordinary textile or artistic value. There are pieces like that here, like the Manish Arora “merry-go-round” skirt, with an actual carnival toy worked into its embroideries, and the Maison Martin Margiela Christmas tinsel coat. But Stella McCartney’s banana T-shirts for Chloé, or Virgil Abloh’s arched eyebrow little black dress with the words “little black dress”? I don’t know if they stand on their own. Also, I can’t help but find it strange that Thierry Mugler, who is one of fashion’s supreme camp designers by any definition, has only two dresses in the show (including the Venus-emerging-from-the-half-shell creation Cardi B wore to the Grammys). It makes me wonder about the criteria. Though, obviously, that Moschino TV dinner dress from the most recent collection makes sense. SMITH And there is an undue amount of Moschino. I counted 15 dresses and ensembles. Most are by Jeremy Scott and are consistently heavy-handed — especially the monstrous TV dinner dress. The one exception is Mr. Scott’s prosciutto dress, which we both liked. It was a simple sheath in a show where simplicity was scarce and, true to its name, it sheathed the body perfectly — latex imitating prosciutto masquerading as silk jersey. FRIEDMAN What I do appreciate, though, is that Mr. Bolton included a number of new names in the show, so it wasn’t only the usual suspects: Tomo Koizumi’s crazy ruffled confections, for example, and Vaquera’s play on the Tiffany blue packaging. And for wit, you can’t really beat Marc Jacobs’s Freudian slip dress — the little white frock with Freud’s portrait on the body. SMITH I loved the Koizumi — at least the lower-level one. Its pile of organza in rainbow colors seemed like the Neo-Expressionist response to the LeWittean order of Christopher Bailey’s rainbow cape. FRIEDMAN In some ways, I thought the “Failed Seriousness” area — the corridor that serves as the connecting passage from the show’s first half to the second — was the tightest, most coherent part of the whole show. But that is partly because it was so narrowly construed: fashion talking to itself. So the Yves Saint Laurent column dress with the big pink fanny bow (which is, indeed, ridiculous; who wants a giant bow on their bottom?) goes perfectly with the Scott-for-Moschino paper doll version of the same; the Lanvin-Castillo lilac ruffled-bustle dress that gets turned upside down, literally, by Viktor & Rolf. You can absolutely see how an idea that didn’t quite come off got transmogrified into a successful camp ideal. Yet that tightening is, also, to me, where the exhibition starts to lose steam, because as it physically narrows it also conceptually narrows, and as you point out, becomes all about fashion. SMITH As a person from an increasingly inclusive art world, I was struck by how few designers of color were present. And I thought there would be something that RuPaul once wore — at the very least. As a non-fashion person, my problem with most of the garments in the final gallery is that so many of them look so useless. The roots of camp are in subversion and opposition. But here, it’s seen only within the rarefied context of high-end fashion, of extremely expensive clothes that will be worn only a few times if at all, before being given to some museum. I wanted more street. I was expecting to see something by Miguel Adrover, who made dresses out of Burberry raincoats and a miniskirt out of a Louis Vuitton purse. His work was disruptive on so many levels in terms of business and creativity. Less disruptive but also camp would have been Stephen Sprouse’s Louis Vuitton bags, or maybe Takashi Murakami’s. FRIEDMAN That didn’t bother me so much, speaking as a fashion person. (Though I also would have loved some Adrover.) I’m used to the fact that some pieces function as expressions of pure ideas, and then later get translated into what people wear. And there are concept clothes in the final section that specifically exemplify the idea of affluence, excess and waste — whether it’s Mr. Scott’s money dress or the plastic bag ball gown by Moschino, or the logo-strewn Guccis. Because there is no context other than quotations (“Camp is BIG business”), we lose the idea that those clothes were both a humorously subversive but pointed comment on current consumer habits while at the same time feeding or even exploiting them. Yet by the time you exit the show, between figures of Cher and Liberace and their most crazily encrusted garments, you’ve almost forgotten about the beginning, and surrendered to camp-as-costume. SMITH Mr. Bolton’s previous exhibitions for Rei Kawakubo, “China: Through the Looking Glass” and “Manus x Machina” are among his greatest. He and his curatorial efforts are by now fixtures in the worlds of art and fashion. There aren’t many curators who year after year show us their thoughts — and research! — on fashion history in a way that is at once so focused and proscribed and yet so open-ended. “Camp” may be the most conflicted show he’s done in a while, but it has real substance. Even if you have moments of hating it, as I think we both do, you’re very engaged throughout. FRIEDMAN Mr. Bolton has a habit of toggling between big, thematic shows and smaller, more personal deep-dives into the work of a designer, and I feel like this resides somewhere between the two forms. What it really reveals is that camp itself is such a giant, elusive concept, it can’t really be satisfyingly contained in the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor galleries. But I’ll give him this: After you go through those doors, you don’t stop thinking about it. It sticks with you and niggles in the brain.

2019,‘Case Closed’: McConnell Urges Congress to Move On From Mueller Report,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called on Congress on Tuesday to move on from the Mueller report and issued his own verdict from the Senate floor: “Case closed.” “With an exhaustive investigation complete, would the country finally unify to confront the real challenges before us?” Mr. McConnell said. “Or would we remain consumed by unhinged partisanship, and keep dividing ourselves to the point that Putin and his agents need only stand on the sidelines and watch as their job is done for them?” “Regrettably,” he continued, “the answer is obvious.” Mr. McConnell’s speech pointed up the profound gap between the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democrat-controlled House. House Democrats are locked in an escalating fight with President Trump, who is trying to slam shut House investigations of all sorts. The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday for ignoring a subpoena for the full report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his underlying evidence. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, that he would not turn over six years of Mr. Trump’s personal and business tax returns, as demanded by Mr. Neal under the federal tax code. And on Tuesday, the White House instructed Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to hold onto documents subpoenaed by House investigators because Mr. Trump might want to assert executive privilege over them. Even in the Senate, some moderate Republicans, like Susan Collins of Maine, have said they would at least like to hear from Mr. Mueller. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California issued a blistering joint statement in response: “Senator McConnell’s declaration of ‘case closed’ is a stunning act of political cynicism and a brazen violation of the oath we all take,” they said. “The special counsel report laid out 11 instances of the president’s obstruction, and left a raft of unanswered questions about coordination between the president’s campaign and Russia. These are not trivial or political questions — they go to the wellspring of our democracy.” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was similarly unsparing, given that his committee’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election is proceeding. But Republican leaders say questions of abuse of power and obstruction of justice are over. Mr. McConnell waved the congressional Democrats off their investigations, arguing that “relitigating a two-and-a-half-year-old election result” and continuing to traffic in “fanciful conspiracy theories” fixated on “delegitimizing the president” would hurt the country. His comments are likely to be well received by the president, who has continued to complain that Democrats are subjecting him to “the highest level of presidential harassment” in American history. Mr. McConnell’s plea to move on, however, is sure to be met only with derision by House Democrats. Mr. McConnell also praised Mr. Trump’s efforts to “make Russia pay for its interference” in the 2016 presidential election — and took President Barack Obama to task for not taking the threat Russia posed seriously enough. Recalling how in 2012, Mr. Obama mocked Mitt Romney, then the Republican presidential nominee, for naming Russia as America’s greatest geopolitical threat, Mr. McConnell speculated that “maybe stronger leadership would have left the Kremlin less emboldened.” That assertion is sure to infuriate Democrats. The Obama White House had appealed to congressional leadership during the 2016 campaign to issue a bipartisan, bicameral statement denouncing Russian interference, fearing that a statement from Mr. Obama would be interpreted as a partisan intervention in the election on behalf of Hillary Clinton.

2019,‘Case Closed’: McConnell Urges Congress to Move On From Mueller Report,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called on Congress on Tuesday to move on from the Mueller report and issued his own verdict from the Senate floor: “Case closed.” “With an exhaustive investigation complete, would the country finally unify to confront the real challenges before us?” Mr. McConnell said. “Or would we remain consumed by unhinged partisanship, and keep dividing ourselves to the point that Putin and his agents need only stand on the sidelines and watch as their job is done for them?” “Regrettably,” he continued, “the answer is obvious.” Mr. McConnell’s speech pointed up the profound gap between the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democrat-controlled House. House Democrats are locked in an escalating fight with President Trump, who is trying to slam shut House investigations of all sorts. The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday for ignoring a subpoena for the full report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his underlying evidence. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, that he would not turn over six years of Mr. Trump’s personal and business tax returns, as demanded by Mr. Neal under the federal tax code. And on Tuesday, the White House instructed Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to hold onto documents subpoenaed by House investigators because Mr. Trump might want to assert executive privilege over them. Even in the Senate, some moderate Republicans, like Susan Collins of Maine, have said they would at least like to hear from Mr. Mueller. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California issued a blistering joint statement in response: “Senator McConnell’s declaration of ‘case closed’ is a stunning act of political cynicism and a brazen violation of the oath we all take,” they said. “The special counsel report laid out 11 instances of the president’s obstruction, and left a raft of unanswered questions about coordination between the president’s campaign and Russia. These are not trivial or political questions — they go to the wellspring of our democracy.” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was similarly unsparing, given that his committee’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election is proceeding. But Republican leaders say questions of abuse of power and obstruction of justice are over. Mr. McConnell waved the congressional Democrats off their investigations, arguing that “relitigating a two-and-a-half-year-old election result” and continuing to traffic in “fanciful conspiracy theories” fixated on “delegitimizing the president” would hurt the country. His comments are likely to be well received by the president, who has continued to complain that Democrats are subjecting him to “the highest level of presidential harassment” in American history. Mr. McConnell’s plea to move on, however, is sure to be met only with derision by House Democrats. Mr. McConnell also praised Mr. Trump’s efforts to “make Russia pay for its interference” in the 2016 presidential election — and took President Barack Obama to task for not taking the threat Russia posed seriously enough. Recalling how in 2012, Mr. Obama mocked Mitt Romney, then the Republican presidential nominee, for naming Russia as America’s greatest geopolitical threat, Mr. McConnell speculated that “maybe stronger leadership would have left the Kremlin less emboldened.” That assertion is sure to infuriate Democrats. The Obama White House had appealed to congressional leadership during the 2016 campaign to issue a bipartisan, bicameral statement denouncing Russian interference, fearing that a statement from Mr. Obama would be interpreted as a partisan intervention in the election on behalf of Hillary Clinton. Mr. McConnell blocked it. He has also blocked a bipartisan, nonbinding resolution in the Senate to make the full Mueller report public, arguing that Mr. Barr should be in charge of determining what was made public.",The New York Times
2019,‘Celestial Bodies’ Wins Man Booker International Prize,"LONDON — “Celestial Bodies,” a family saga set against Oman’s transition from slave trading center to oil producer, became on Tuesday the first novel originally written in Arabic to win the Man Booker International Prize. The book’s author, Jokha Alharthi of Oman, shares the award of 50,000 pounds, about $63,000, with its translator, Marilyn Booth. The prize, given each year to the best book translated into English and published in Britain, is widely seen as the world’s most significant award for translated fiction. It is distinct from the more well-known Booker Prize, for fiction originally published in English. Bettany Hughes, the chairwoman of the judging panel, called “Celestial Bodies” “a book to win over the head and the heart in equal measure.” “Its delicate artistry draws us into a richly imagined community, opening out to tackle profound questions of time and mortality,” she said in a statement announcing the award. Ms. Alharthi’s book was chosen over efforts by higher-profile names, among them the Polish author Olga Tokarczuk — who won last year’s prize for “Flights” — and Annie Ernaux, the celebrated French author. Ms. Alharthi’s novel, first published in 2010 as “Ladies of the Moon,” is an at times complex book that follows an Omani family over three generations, from the 1880s to today. “Every character — woman or man, enslaved or free — finds themselves trapped, in some way, by history” as Oman itself changes around them, Marcia Lynx Qualey wrote in a review for The National, a newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates. The book is “a beautifully achieved account of lives pulling at the edges of change” Michael Cronin wrote in The Irish Times, adding that it also “deftly undermines recurrent stereotypes about Arab language and cultures.” Jane Housham, writing in The Guardian, said although the number of characters was bewildering at times, “the glimpses into a culture relatively little known in the West are fascinating.” Ms. Alharthi said in an interview published on the Man Booker International Prize’s website that Omani authors want foreign readers to look at the country “with an open mind and heart.” “No matter where you are, love, loss, friendship, pain and hope are the same feelings,” she said, “and humanity still has a lot of work to do to believe in this truth.” Five of the six authors, and all the translators, on this year’s shortlist were women, an unusually high number for a book prize. Female authors accounted for 31 percent of new works translated into English and published in the United States in 2017, Meytal Radzinski, the founder of Women In Translation month said in an email. The Booker International shortlist showed that things were changing, Helen Vassallo, an academic at the University of Exeter who studies translation and gender, said in a telephone interview. Translators are commissioned for works, but have also recently pushed some female authors, Ms. Vassallo added. “They’re these really passionate people championing works that have changed their lives,” she said. “They’re doing massive amounts of work behind the scenes.” Ms. Booth, the translator of “Celestial Bodies,” said in an interview for the prize’s website that the “vivid use” of local expressions and classical Arabic poetry made translating the novel an “enormous challenge.” But the book shows what imaginative writing is happening across the Arab world, she said, even in a country “that is less literarily mapped” like Oman. These books are art that is “pushing the boundaries of what can be thought and said,” she added.",The New York Times
2019,‘Charlie Says’ Review: Complicating Those Manson Family Values,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Soon after Charles Manson was indicted on murder charges in 1969, his dream of celebrity became a reality. Life magazine put him on a cover with a headline — “The Love and Terror Cult” — that read like a trashy film poster. Inside, there was more horror, more titillation: “Flattery, fear and sex lured his girls into a sisterhood of exploitation.” Manson was the star — the mythic monster, the devil among us, the dark side of the American id — but just as fascinating were the pretty young women with the flowing hair and big, blank smiles who formed the eerie nucleus of what was called the family. In her powerful and deeply affecting “Charlie Says,” Mary Harron revisits the Manson cult in a dramatization largely told from the perspective of his female followers. It’s a tough, difficult story that, anchored by Guinevere Turner’s script, Harron recounts with lucid calm, compassion and intelligent interpretive license. She revisits some of the familiar locations, including the dusty California ranch where the Manson family set up house, and she carefully restages some of the murders. For those familiar with the horrific details of those crimes, the movie may seem wholly uninviting, but bear with Harron — she has something to say. One of the smartest things about “Charlie Says” is that, as the name telegraphs, it isn’t really about its title character, who can feel like a blank even when onscreen. (He’s played by the British actor Matt Smith, from the television shows “Doctor Who” and “The Crown.”) The movie instead narrows in on three female followers who, under his sway, compulsively repeat what he says, invoking him like a deity. Their idolatry begins shifting in prison when they meet Karlene Faith (the empathetic Merritt Wever), a graduate student who cracks open the door to their consciousness — and, by extension, their autonomous selves — by asking something that hasn’t been asked in a while: What do you think? Karlene is teaching in a California women’s prison where, after their conviction, the women have been isolated from the main population. Answering the invitation of the enlightened warden (Annabeth Gish), she starts engaging with the women, just by talking. It’s a modest first step in what becomes a complex attempt to rehumanize and reindividualize them. To themselves and the outside world — in real life, they were often referred to as the Manson girls or Charlie’s girls, and seen as part of his so-called harem — these women remain under his shadow, an extension of him, his property. This then is about a struggle for freedom, a liberation of the mind and the spirit that is fought for in prison visits and through consciousness-raising and mind-expanding reading. Karlene gives the women copies of Robin Morgan’s feminist landmark “Sisterhood Is Powerful.” Over the course of the story, she also peels away their defenses and smiles, digging into their past with Charlie, which is glimpsed in elliptical flashbacks. As the three begin responding, they become recognizably human, at times uneasily likable, which only deepens the horror of their crimes. It is, the movie argues, easier to label someone a monster than to acknowledge that ordinary people can be monstrous. Leslie, a.k.a. Lulu (a quietly affecting Hannah Murray, from “Game of Thrones”), becomes the main portal to the family’s past. (The character is based on Leslie Van Houten, who, with Manson, was found guilty of murders, along with the other two featured women: Susan Atkins, a.k.a. Sadie, played by Marianne Rendón; and Patricia Krenwinkel, a.k.a. Katie, played by Sosie Bacon.) Leslie first meets Charlie when she’s brought by a friend to the Spahn Movie Ranch, the rundown location and tourist attraction where the family has set up ramshackle house. There, amid the dust and scrub and sagging old-timey wooden buildings, Charlie lords over a gaggle of hangers-on, mostly women. The flashbacks are smoothly integrated with the prison sequences, which visually underscores that these spaces have more in common than it might seem. Harron often uses dissolves to further blur past and present; as things fall apart on the ranch and Charlie’s eccentricities grow progressively more frenzied, the interiors grow dimmer and seemingly smaller, more claustrophobic. There are different ways to imprison someone, including with love and instilled dependence. Leslie (Lulu at the ranch) loves Charlie and has surrendered to him. Part of what is so tragic and ghastly about the Manson family is that sometimes this surrender looks like liberation. There’s a feminist argument to be made about the dangers of an all-consuming dependence that feels inescapable, even desirable. But Harron and Turner aren’t engaging in polemics; they’re telling a complex, nuanced story about power and how it is both taken and surrendered. And while Leslie, Susan and Patricia are victims, they are also victimizers, which the movie reminds you as it creeps toward the murders and toward a harrowing, mercifully brief scene with the family’s most famous victim, Sharon Tate (Grace Van Dien), then married to Roman Polanski. Harron, best known for “American Psycho,” handles the violence here brilliantly, rightly keeping the focus on Tate. At first, Smith, who’s fuzzed and scuzzed for the role, seems miscast. His Charlie isn’t especially attractive and doesn’t read as remotely charismatic. The further the story develops, the more this lack of conspicuous magnetism reads like a deliberate choice, a strategic way of taking away some of the odious star power and fame-burnishing mystery that Manson accrued over the years. It’s hard to imagine this cult leader inspiring the interest, even adulation (ironic or not), that the real figure did. Manson was an aspiring musician and former convict; in this telling, he is also a two-bit lunatic con man, the kind who recurrently pops up in American history selling a dream that becomes a nightmare. An earlier version of a picture caption with this review, using information from IFC Films, misidentified the actors. They are, from left, Julia Schlaepfer, Hannah Murray, Dayle McLeod, Sosie Bacon, Suki Waterhouse, Marianne Rendón and Kayli Carter.

2019,‘Clara’ Review: Love Means Never Having to Say You’re Starry,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Clara” cloaks its clichés in astronomy jargon and mood lighting, but in the final analysis this Canadian feature from Akash Sherman is yet another movie about a dying dream woman whose cosmic role is to teach a ruthless empiricist to go with the flow. Dr. Isaac Bruno (Patrick J. Adams) is such a stick in the mud that, in the opening scene, he proves mathematically to his students that searching for life beyond Earth is a safer bet than looking for love. His boss insists that he take a break. It is suggested that Isaac is getting over a tragedy in his past. But he still needs to discover a potentially life-sustaining planet, and now he has to do it from home. So he advertises for a research assistant. Enter Clara (Troian Bellisario), a free spirit who has bounced from continent to continent. She has no qualifications for the live-in position, but he has no other applicants, and soon the odd couple find that their styles — he believes the universe is random; she believes there is order — mesh well. Secretly, Clara tends to an illness. Isaac’s colleague (Ennis Esmer) points out to him that if you spend all your time looking up at the stars, you’re going to miss what’s right in front of you. That may sound like a glib paraphrase — but no, it’s an actual line. While the movie’s morose mysticism is tolerable enough, once “Clara” starts arguing for following feelings instead of data, it puts on its own tinfoil hat.

2019,"‘David Cross: Oh, Come On’ Review: Muffled Anger Over Sentimentality","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The sentimental take on having a child is that it pushes you to look beyond yourself and place the needs of others over narrow self-interest. But in his latest special, “Oh, Come On,” David Cross, a new parent, describes it as pure narcissism: “It’s this subconscious thing in the back of everyone’s head, this idea, you know, ‘I like me. I think there should be more of me in the world.’” In his long, pioneering stand-up career, Cross, who helped build the alt-comedy scene in the 1990s and made some of the most significant Bush-era polemics of the following decade, has always exuded a certain self-regard, if not smugness. His salvos against political opponents or people of faith (he’s an atheist) can operate like an articulate sneer, and a hallmark of his acidic comedy is the muffled anger of someone exhausted by the stupidity surrounding him. This kind of comedy can be pulled off, but it’s tricky, and can easily fall victim to self-indulgence. With the possible exception of his jokes about fatherhood, which are sharp, unsentimental and more economical than the rest of his digressive 70 minutes, Cross’s labored new special picks easy targets: Grateful Dead cover bands, hippies, Southerners with thick accents, and Twitter memes (although he does have a good self-deprecating joke about his own failures at tweeting). Wearing ripped jeans and a baseball cap that sometimes casts a shadow over his eyes, Cross moseys back and forth over three rugs that give the stage the feeling of a sparsely decorated room in a bed-and-breakfast. In a time when the direction of comedy specials is increasingly ambitious, Lance Bangs’s camerawork is rote, using old-fashioned cutaway shots of people laughing, but not always bothering to find different audience members. His big set pieces are a scatological story about getting a colonic with his wife, the actress Amber Tamblyn, and an inevitable broadside against President Trump. (Even before Trump’s election, Cross had a tour called “Making America Great Again!”) After explaining how difficult it is to find comedy in mocking the president, he mocks Trump supporters who only recently have become disillusioned and then pivots toward revenge fantasy, a genre of comedy that has in the past been a vehicle for self-parody or virtuosic verbal or imaginative displays. But when Cross describes the actor Ron Perlman beating up Trump, he leaves any trace of wit behind. By this point, he’s doing more punching than punch lines.

2019,‘Dead to Me’ Deals With Love and Loss. The Stars Speak From Experience.,"On “Dead to Me,” Jen and Judy are best friends forever. Or until the next cliffhanger. This new “traumedy,” which began streaming last week on Netflix, follows two 40-something women who meet at a grief support group in Southern California and bond almost immediately. (Misery loves company and late-night “Facts of Life” marathons.) Jen (Christina Applegate), a tough-as-manicured-nails realtor, has lost her husband, Ted, to a hit-and-run. Judy (Linda Cardellini), a moony painter, is mourning her fiancée. Probably. Over 10 half hours, which careen from comedy to drama to thriller, the women’s lives and stories take dangerous swerves. So yeah, some spoilers follow. If you haven’t started the series, avert your eyes. Because finding out, at the end of the first episode, that Judy drove the car that hit Ted? It’s a pretty good surprise. [Read our review of “Dead to Me.”] There are other, less lethal surprises, like the show’s frank discussion of women’s health — miscarriage, perimenopause, mastectomy — and its nuanced vision of female friendship. On a recent afternoon at New York’s Netflix offices, just west of Union Square, the two women posed in tottery heels (Applegate immediately traded hers for a pair of Converses), then subsided into an overstuffed couch to talk grief, camaraderie and career longevity. Toward the interview’s end, series creator Liz Feldman briefly joined in. These are excerpts from the conversation. Tell me about Jen and Judy. CHRISTINA APPLEGATE Jen is unlike anyone, but she’s an Everywoman. The world is trying to get her to stop being who she is and stop feeling what she’s feeling and as a result she is incredibly rageful and reactive. She doesn’t know how to smile or laugh or let anyone comfort her. When she meets Judy, it’s life-changing. LINDA CARDELLINI Judy is a glass-half-full person, but life keeps dumping that glass of water over her head. Why do you think these characters become such close friends? APPLEGATE Because they allow each other to suffer. I’ve gone through grief in my life. Some people didn’t understand. There’s nothing that holds you down in your grief more than people trying to get you to stop feeling what you’re feeling. Jen and Judy both allow each other to feel what they need to feel. That understanding and that sisterhood is a bond that cannot be broken. CARDELLINI They’re two people who can totally be themselves with each other. Even though Judy can never truly be herself. Is this a good friendship? Does it have a darker side? CARDELLINI Sometimes in a codependent relationship, you enable people to do things that they shouldn’t be doing. Like taking a golf club to someone’s windshield? CARDELLINI Or when Jen keys a car and Judy says, “I love you.” That’s warped. What’s the worst thing a friend has ever done to you? APPLEGATE I honestly have chosen awesome people. I’m kind of like a “no new friends” person except for my kid’s friends’ parents. And her. [Points to Cardellini.] She’s allowed to come in. But when I was younger, I had a tendency to let people — I wouldn’t even call them friends — come into my life and manipulate me. CARDELLINI I’m careful with choosing my friends. The only thing I can think of is friends who are gone too soon. It’s not their fault, but I miss them. Is “Dead to Me” a show about loss, about dealing with it poorly? APPLEGATE Is there a right way to deal with loss? Society wants you to grieve for like a month, and it’s such [expletive]. I have lost people incredibly close to me suddenly and unexpectedly, and I still think about it. There’s no right or wrong way to do it. You have to honor how you’re feeling. CARDELLINI Will you repeat the question? I was listening to the answer. APPLEGATE She asked me what I was wearing, what designers. And then I just decided to talk about loss. CARDELLINI When you lose somebody, you do the best you can. There are two things in life that you should be able to handle because they’re sort of inevitable: Loss of life and loss of love. And those two things are impossible to know how to deal with, no matter how many times they happen to you. Did you personalize these characters? Christina, did you suggest Jen’s bilateral mastectomy? APPLEGATE I wanted Jen to have something that made her vulnerable. Making the choice to have a prophylactic mastectomy caused problems in her marriage. So she lives with an insane amount of guilt and shame. Exploring what it’s like to be someone who’s had an amputation, that was the most personal thing that I brought to it. Linda, what did you bring to Judy? CARDELLINI There’s a scene at the end of the show where I lose somebody and I say, “I didn’t get to say goodbye.” That was not in the script. But it came out of my mouth. Because I’ve lost people that I didn’t get to say goodbye to. [Starts to cry.] I’m sorry. And now we’re all going to cry. CARDELLINI This show, we call it a traumedy, because there’s so much traumatic stuff that happens, and then there’s humor to sort of alleviate that tension and stress. APPLEGATE Some people have been confused by it. But in life we laugh and we cry and we get surprised by things and we get shocked by things and people are not what they seem. It’s what life feels like — dark and twisty and funny. Did you know every twist when filming began? APPLEGATE I knew what was going to happen. It was in Liz’s first pitch to me. And I thought, “That’s just so far-fetched. How do we earn that?” But we earned it! CARDELLINI On a different show, what you learn at the very end of the first episode could have been an entire season’s arc. With the second season, we know what’s been set up and where it could go. Have you been picked up for a second season? CARDELLINI [Gestures toward the Netflix office.] Ask them. APPLEGATE [Shouting.] Are we getting picked up? CARDELLINI They’re all ignoring us. Had you really never met before you were hired? APPLEGATE Well, I don’t leave my house. CARDELLINI Yeah, I hardly leave either. We both signed on. Then we had lunch. APPLEGATE At Crossroads Kitchen, the best vegan restaurant on the planet. We were in love from the get go. People are like, do you guys really like each other? If only they knew! CARDELLINI We’re really lucky to have finally been able to meet and to work together. [Turning to Applegate.] I mean, you’re a great actress, and a good friend. Both of you found success pretty early on. Christina, you had “Married with Children.” Linda, you were on “Freaks and Geeks.” Was that a strange way to grow up? APPLEGATE On “Married,” there was a work ethic: Never take advantage of the people around you, be professional, show up early, know your lines better than anybody. I remember, being really sick and asking a stage manager if she wouldn’t mind getting me an orange juice. She goes, “You have legs.” No one ever treated me special. I think that’s probably why I go through the world not telling my parents that I got nominated for an Emmy. CARDELLINI Not a lot of people watched my show while it was on the air. We were in the Macy’s Day Parade — we were standing on top of a teapot for no reason — and I remember people flipping us off and yelling, “Who are you?” It’s never happened all at once for me, which afforded me the ability to be a working actress and to earn, which is what I always wanted. I didn’t necessarily want to be famous. APPLEGATE This is tongue-in-cheek, but someone asked me one time, “What’s the secret to your longevity?” I said, “Mediocre success.” Hollywood hasn’t always known what to do with actresses once they age out of ingénues. Is this improving? APPLEGATE [Liz Feldman enters.] Liz Feldman, hi! Oh yeah. I think more and more we’re seeing that. “The Favourite.” Hello! “Big Little Lies.” LIZ FELDMAN There’s also more acceptance for writing roles for women over 40; there’s actually more of a thirst for it. When I wrote this, nobody said, “Could you make them younger?” CARDELLINI The over-40 thing? I feel very fortunate that I’ve found this show. It feels better and more well-earned at this age than ever. But I go back and forth. Sometimes I’m strong with it, and sometimes I’m not. It depends. APPLEGATE Come hang out with me! But yeah, I watched this show and I said to Liz, “Oh my god, I’m 47 and I look … 47.” There are moments of, “When did that happen?” FELDMAN You’re a pretty damn good 47. APPLEGATE But you have those days where you feel like, “Aw, damn it.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Deadwood’: What to Remember for the HBO Movie,"David Milch’s long-awaited coda for his beloved western has its debut on Friday on HBO. Here’s where we left off. The doors of the Gem Saloon closed nearly 13 years ago when HBO canceled David Milch’s “Deadwood,” breaking the hearts of millions of fans. For the better part of a decade, rumors circulated of a return to Deadwood as the show’s lead actors, like Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane and Paula Malcomson, moved on to other projects. In October 2018, the stars finally aligned, allowing Milch and company to return to South Dakota to tie up a few plot threads left dangling from the abrupt cancellation. Milch’s long-awaited coda for his beloved series, “Deadwood: The Movie,” has its debut on Friday on HBO, taking place a full decade after its third season. Here’s where we left off. Al Swearengen (Ian McShane): The owner of Deadwood’s Gem Saloon and a poet of profanity, Al is the morally gray center that defined the show for three seasons. Swearengen keenly understands that his business — prostitutes and whiskey — relies on town stability, and has done whatever it took to maintain the viability of the former mining camp turned flourishing town while remaining loyal to those who are loyal to him. Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant): After resettling from Montana to Deadwood to start a simple, new life, Seth found himself sucked into the growing town’s various power struggles, becoming its sheriff and the co-owner of a hardware store with his buddy Sol Star (John Hawkes). He had a brief affair with Alma Garret (Molly Parker) before the arrival of his wife Martha (Anna Gunn) and stepson William, who died in Season 2. Alma Garret/Ellsworth (Molly Parker): Alma Garret came to Deadwood with her wealthy husband, Brom, who was murdered early in Season 1. Their mining claim ended up being one of the most profitable in the region, turning her into a target for a series of predators. She had an affair with Bullock and settled down with Whitney Ellsworth (Jim Beaver), the man who ran the work on her claim. Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) and Charlie Utter (Dayton Callie): These unforgettable personalities came to Deadwood in the premiere with Wild Bill Hickock (Keith Carradine), but hung around long after Hickock’s murder by the coward Jack McCall (Garret Dillahunt). Jane is fiercely loyal but is also an alcoholic prone to emotional outbursts. She ended up in a tender relationship with Joanie Stubbs (Kim Dickens). Utter found himself aligned with Bullock at times, helping to maintain order in the camp. Joanie Stubbs (Kim Dickens): When she arrived in Deadwood, Joanie worked with Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe, who died in 2017) at the Bella Union, a high-end brothel. She tried to open her own business called the Chez Amis, but that ended in bloodshed at the hands of Francis Wolcott (also Garret Dillahunt). Doc Cochran (Brad Dourif): The town doctor, Cochran is a deeply moral and yet entirely nonjudgmental man. He cares for Al’s girls at the Gem on a regular basis and has played at least a minor role in nearly every character’s story arc — from treating Alma’s addiction to handling William’s body after his death. Trixie (Paula Malcomson): One of Al’s most loyal prostitutes, Trixie started a new chapter when she became involved with Sol, working in the bank they opened in town but always remaining loyal to the Gem and Al, too. The main narrative thrust of the show’s third season was the battle between Gerald McRaney’s manipulative and malevolent tycoon George Hearst and, well, everyone. George Hearst created havoc: Hearst, who will return in the film, has been primarily concerned with controlling Deadwood’s lucrative future and expanding his empire. In Season 3 he bullied most of the town, attempting to instill distrust and fear. It started with the murder of his own Cornish miners in the Gem Saloon, escalating quickly to Swearengen’s finger being chopped off, Alma being shot at in the street and Ellsworth being murdered. Trixie shot Hearst, and Swearengen covered it up: After seeing Ellsworth’s body carted through the street, Trixie marched to Hearst’s door, stripped off most of her clothing, and shot him in the shoulder. Hearst didn’t die, and he demanded justice for the attempted murder, leading Swearengen to kill another one of his girls and attempt to convince Hearst that Trixie had been fatally punished. In the season’s closing scenes, it appears that Hearst has bought the ruse and Trixie is safe, but the villain still rides off over the horizon. Bullock lost an election: While Hearst was sowing dissent, Deadwood was preparing for an election. Bullock and Harry Manning vied for sheriff. The unpopular Manning won — though the results might have been manipulated by Hearst — leaving Bullock, the natural-born lawman, to run his hardware store. Cochran had a nasty cough: Nearly every time Cochran appeared in Season 3, he had a raspy cough that appeared to only be getting worse. Disease has been a recurring motif on “Deadwood,” and it seemed likely that a fourth season would reveal for certain that Cochran had tuberculosis. However Dourif is part of the film, which takes place a decade later — it’s unclear how he’s held on for so long. Joanie and Calamity Jane found each other: When Season 3 began, two of the characters who seemed most adrift were women seemingly at the opposite ends of the social spectrum — a former high-priced madam and a lost soul who is drunk more often than she’s sober. However, Calamity Jane found purpose when Joanie asked her to help take care of the children at the newly formed school, then the two found love with each other. It was one of the most tender, moving relationships on the show. Alma battled addiction: Alma fought an addiction to laudanum in the first and third seasons, which led to Ellsworth moving out of their house, blaming himself for her unhappiness. However, caring for an orphaned girl named Sophia gave Alma new purpose in life, steeling her resolve to fight back against the powerful men coming after her mining claim. While she kicked her addiction again in Season 3, after Ellsworth’s murder, it seems possible that Alma’s demons could return.",The New York Times
2019,‘Decade of Fire’ Review: A Documentary Remembers the Blazes That Scorched the Bronx,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Decade of Fire” positions itself as a corrective to the notion that Bronx residents were responsible for the wave of arson that laid siege to the borough in the 1970s. Vivian Vázquez Irizarry, who directed the documentary with Gretchen Hildebran and also narrates, begins with a rejoinder. “We did not burn the South Bronx,” she says. “In fact, we were the ones who saved it.” For the filmmaker, who grew up in the borough’s Longwood section, the history is personal. The idea that fires were, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote in a memorandum to President Nixon in 1970, a “leading indicator” of a neighborhood’s “social pathology” is portrayed as tantamount to victim blaming. Vázquez interweaves memories of her upbringing with a rundown of civic practices that, in combination, led to the Bronx’s decline. Some, like Robert Moses’s partitioning of the Bronx with the Cross Bronx Expressway or “redlining” — the systematic denial of investment to neighborhoods dominated by racial minorities — will be familiar to any student of urban planning or New York history. Other details are more eye opening. We’re told that after Mayor John Lindsay initiated a city partnership with the RAND Corporation in 1967, computer modeling intended to make firefighting more efficient somehow resulted in high-fire, poor neighborhoods’ losing fire companies while low-fire neighborhoods stayed the same or gained. There is mention of firefighters coming from as far as Staten Island to combat the Bronx blazes, which became so common that perhaps half were not recorded in official records. Viewers of the 1977 World Series saw the conflagrations on TV. “Decade of Fire” is at its best when showing how the fires affected individuals effectively left to fend for themselves. Without reliable civic services, neighborhoods turned to gangs for protection. Impoverished residents began functioning as the bottom rungs in kickback chains: Youths would get chump change to burn buildings while landlords made off with insurance money, never to return. Vázquez interviews a woman who remembers being involved in torching sites and says she regrets every single time she did so. The last movement of the film deals with grass-roots efforts to help the borough come back. This is the most inspiring section, although it is also the point when Vázquez’s forthrightly subjective history starts to shade into advocacy. (Her glancingly depicted opposition to rezoning on Jerome Avenue, for instance, is presented as self-evidently correct without much detail.) Then again, her stake in the issues at hand is part of what makes “Decades of Fire” valuable. This is a filmmaker with skin in the game, close to the flames. An earlier version of this review, using information provided by a publicist, carried an incorrect picture credit. The photograph was by Joey Conzo, not Camilla Padgitt-Coles.

2019,‘Diamantino’ Review: The Fairy Tale Life of a Soccer Star,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. When he’s on the playing field, Diamantino Matamouros (Carloto Cotta), the Portuguese soccer superstar who’s the hero of this simultaneously goofy and deft satirical comedy, doesn’t see his human opponents. Instead he sees “fluffy puppies,” giant Pekingese dogs romping in pink clouds, around whom he navigates his offensive drive. Diamantino himself is a bit of a pup, beloved by his soon-to-die father, hated by his evil twin sisters. His way of looking at life takes a double hit when he blows a particularly important penalty kick shortly after learning, for the first time, about the existence of migrant refugees. How a grown man got to his thirties without such knowledge is in part because of the bubble of celebrity. But it’s also because while Diamantino is a genius at soccer, his cognition in nearly every other respect sorely lacks. And this is how an adult woman investigating the star’s finances can pass herself off as a preteen boy refugee and gain access to Diamantino’s home. And no, I don’t believe the audience is meant to find this at all plausible. There are moments in which this film, written and directed by Gabriel Abrantes and Daniel Schmidt, feels like an early Adam Sandler comedy remixed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. Diamantino’s sisters sell him to Portugal’s propaganda office, and the comeback-seeking star is hornswoggled into an authoritarian campaign with strong notes of Trumpism and Brexit. And here, the secret service agent Aisha (Cleo Tavares), who, in the guise of the refugee “Rahim,” had gotten uncomfortably close to Diamantino, must make a choice. As these two characters, Cotta and Tavares make an unusually appealing odd couple — and the most idiosyncratic rooting interests the movies have served up this year.

2019,"‘Domino’ Review: All Voyeurism, All the Time","In Brian De Palma’s new film, a personal revenge story line is subsumed by horrific visions of television-friendly acts of terror. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The Copenhagen cop Christian (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is a pleasant fellow but not a terribly good police officer. Leaving his apartment to go on an early morning shift with his partner and pal Lars (Soren Malling), and distracted by the nude woman trying to get him to stay, Christian forgets to take his gun with him. Later, at a crime scene — a grisly torture-murder — he borrows his partner’s gun. This allows the fearsomely bearded suspect, Ezra (Eriq Ebouaney), to fatally assault that partner. During a rooftop chase that looks like the opening of Hitchcock’s “Vertigo” reimagined as a vintage Doublemint gum ad, Christian manages to lose the borrowed weapon, too. Under other circumstances, the director, Brian De Palma, might have squeezed some mordant humor out of his protagonist’s ineptitude. De Palma’s career took off with the paranoid comedies “Greetings” and “Hi, Mom!” five decades back, and his filmography has encompassed horror, crime and other genres, all delivered with a sardonic edge. Even blockbuster exercises such as “Mission: Impossible” (1996) managed an acerbic undercurrent. But “Domino,” arriving here after the director complained in at least one interview about the way the film’s producers treated him, isn’t all that unified with respect to the values it contains and excludes. The movie shows almost no interest in a personal payback plot (the script is by Petter Skavlan), even after Christian is joined by Alex (Carice van Houten), who was closer to Lars than poor Christian is able to guess. As for Ezra, he’s nabbed by the glib C.I.A. chess master Joe Martin (Guy Pearce, having some fun) and compelled to continue killing. Shaving both his beard and his head, Ezra tracks the same jihadists that Christian and Alex find themselves pursuing. And what jihadists they are. One of them has a machine-gun-mounted video camera with sensors recording both the shooter in close-up and the victims, and feeding the images to a split-screen display. The scene in which she takes the weapon/camera ensemble to the Netherlands Film Festival is quite a set piece. De Palma can’t realize all the elaborate effects he clearly wanted (the film’s climax occurs at a bullfight that’s conspicuously not crowded). But his direction often compensates with B-movie energy, particularly when he’s able to concentrate on his perverse vision. The death-dealing, all-voyeurism-all-the-time world that De Palma has been imagining in some form or another since the late ’60s, has, he recognizes, finally come into actual being, and it’s worse than he, or anyone, ever imagined. At times during “Domino,” the director seems practically giddy about it. Domino Rated R for language, themes, violence, a paranoid vision of the world come true. Running time: 1 hour 29 minutes.

2019,‘Dream Sequence’ Is a Novel of Obsessive Celebrity Fandom,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. DREAM SEQUENCE By Adam Foulds Henry Banks, the actor at the center of Adam Foulds’s fourth novel, “Dream Sequence,” has just finished six years on a very popular British TV show, “The Grange,” a “Downton Abbey”-type series. He’s starving himself in the hopes of winning the role of Mike, the ghostly American veteran of the Iraq war in the “genius” director Miguel Garcia’s new film. This is the kind of role that could bring him to the next level. He looks at his face in the mirror, a lot, and reflects on his beauty. “Henry’s face was something everybody had to deal with, to assimilate and get over, even Henry. … His handsomeness could be a shock, as much for him as for others.” One of those such people is Kristin, a divorced, lonely, obsessed fan living in Philadelphia. She once briefly met Henry in an airport, and now writes him long, creepy letters twice a week, though his management keeps the correspondence from him. Better to let Henry focus on Henry, on his potential as an artiste, with maybe an assistant and a private jet. The celebrity-fan relationship has changed considerably in the past several years, with the emergence of social media and its enabling of virtual interactions in real time. Famous people can respond to our tweets or like our Instagram comments and we suddenly feel connected to them (except for @jordanpeele, who never answers me). For at least that one split second, we imagine they are thinking about us (or their assistant or social media manager is anyway). A lot of lines have been blurred as we observe them inside the celebrity fishbowl behaving, on the internet, “just like us.” In the one letter that slips through a new assistant and gets to Henry, Kristin writes, “Remember how I told you that soon after we met I was down in St. Thomas and I wrote your name in the sand and drew a heart round it?” Later it pops into his head and Henry thinks: “If fame had taught him anything it was that everybody was mad in that way, in the dark privacy of their thoughts. Fame pulled it out of them like magnets, the weird personal connections, the destinies, the universe wanting things for them, or needing them to go through things first, to help them learn.” Henry’s a fairly harmless narcissist. He calls his parents, spends time humoring his unsuccessful playwright father’s ambitions to get his script to an agent. He screws around with an affable American model at a press junket in Qatar, but he likes her and ends up seeing her again. While Henry’s motivations are pretty transparent, Kristin’s are more of a mystery: What brought her to this place? Her marriage has ended, and with that she loses contact with her stepson. She doesn’t have a job, but she’s set financially. There is a sizable void in her life that she fills with Henry — on her TV, via Google alerts tracking his every move, through his Twitter mentions. She even repaints her house to match the colors of the one on “The Grange.” What ultimately causes Kristin to lose her grip on reality isn’t clear, but when she sets off to London to make her and Henry’s relationship real, it is more than a little unnerving. “Dream Sequence” succeeds as a narrative thanks to Foulds’s prose. He doesn’t waste a single word, is frequently very funny, insightful and surprising. And he does a marvelous job of making us wonder who loves Henry the most, Kristin or Henry — and which of these possibilities is the most alarming consequence of celebrity.",The New York Times
2019,‘Earthworm Dilemma’ Has Climate Scientists Racing to Keep Up,"Worms are wriggling into Earth’s northernmost forests, creating major unknowns for climate-change models. Cindy Shaw, a carbon-research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, studies the boreal forest — the world’s most northerly forest, which circles the top of the globe like a ring of hair around a balding head. A few years ago, while conducting a study in northern Alberta to see how the forest floor was recovering after oil and gas activity, she saw something she had never seen there before: earthworms. “I was amazed,” she said. “At the very first plot, there was a lot of evidence of earthworm activity.” Native earthworms disappeared from most of northern North America 10,000 years ago, during the ice age. Now invasive earthworm species from southern Europe — survivors of that frozen epoch, and introduced to this continent by European settlers centuries ago — are making their way through northern forests, their spread hastened by roads, timber and petroleum activity, tire treads, boats, anglers and even gardeners. As the worms feed, they release into the atmosphere much of the carbon stored in the forest floor. Climate scientists are worried. “Earthworms are yet another factor that can affect the carbon balance,” Werner Kurz, a researcher with the Canadian Forest Service in Victoria, British Columbia, wrote in an email. His fear is that the growing incursion of earthworms — not just in North America, but also in northern Europe and Russia — could convert the boreal forest, now a powerful global carbon sponge, into a carbon spout. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Moreover, the threat is still so new to boreal forests that scientists don’t yet know how to calculate what the earthworms’ carbon effect will be, or when it will appear. “It is a significant change to the carbon dynamic and how we understand it works,” Ms. Shaw said. “We don’t truly understand the rate or the magnitude of that change.” The relationship between carbon and earthworms is complex. Earthworms are beloved by gardeners because they break down organic material in soil, freeing up nutrients. This helps plants and trees grow faster, which locks carbon into living tissue. Some types of invasive earthworms also burrow into mineral soil and seal carbon there. But as earthworms speed decomposition, they also release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. As they occupy more areas of the world, will they ultimately add more carbon to the atmosphere — or subtract it? That question led to what Ingrid M. Lubbers, a soil researcher at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, christened the “earthworm dilemma” in a paper published in 2013 in Nature Climate Change. Scientists have been keen to resolve it ever since. “It’s just another of the many reasons why you need to know more about systems,” Dr. Lubbers said in an interview. “Because there could be an effect that would enhance climate change and enhance the rising temperatures.” The boreal is special. In warmer climates, the floor of a typical forest is a mix of mineral soil and organic soil. In a boreal forest, those components are distinct, with a thick layer of rotting leaves, mosses and fallen wood on top of the mineral soil. Soil scientists once thought that cooler temperatures reduced mixing; now, they wonder if the absence of earthworms is what made the difference. This spongy layer of leaf litter contains most of the carbon stored in the boreal soil. As it turns out, most of the invading earthworms in the North American boreal appear to be the type that love to devour leaf litter and stay above ground, releasing carbon. Erin K. Cameron, an environmental scientist at Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who studies the boreal incursion of earthworms, found that 99.8 percent of the earthworms in her study area in Alberta belonged Dendrobaena octaedra, an invasive species that eats leaf litter but doesn’t burrow into the soil. In 2015, Dr. Cameron published the results of a computer model aimed at figuring out the effect on leaf-litter over time. “What we see with our model is that forest-floor carbon is reduced by between 50 percent and 94 percent, mostly in the first 40 years,” she said. That carbon, no longer sequestered, goes into the atmosphere. Not only that, in a 2009 study she calculated that earthworms had already wriggled their way into 9 percent of the forest of northeastern Alberta, and would occupy half of it by 2049. Ms. Shaw, of the Canadian Forest Service, found that 35 to 40 percent of the plots she examined in northern Alberta contained earthworms. The leaf litter, which can be more than a foot thick, was thin and churned up where earthworms were present. If Dr. Cameron’s calculations bear out, it means the lowly earthworm stands to alter the carbon balance of the planet by adding to the load in the atmosphere. The global boreal forest is a muscular part of Earth’s carbon cycle; at least one-fifth of the carbon that cycles through air, soil and oceans passes through the boreal, said Sylvie Quideau, a soil biogeochemist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. Currently, the boreal absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it adds, but that is changing. On one hand, warmer temperatures could extend the growing season, allowing trees to grow bigger and store more carbon, said Dr. Kurz, the forest researcher in British Columbia. But rising temperatures also release carbon to the atmosphere, by thawing permafrost and increasing the number of forest fires. All told, he sees earthworms as another factor — if not the main one — nudging the boreal toward becoming a global source of carbon. In northern Minnesota, the boreal forest has slowly been invaded by earthworms. They have altered not just the depth of the leaf litter but also the types of plants the forest supports, said Adrian Wackett, who studied earthworms in the North American and European boreal forest for his master’s degree at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. Endemic species such as the pink and white lady’s slipper — Minnesota’s state flower — as well as ferns, orchids and the saplings of coniferous trees rely on the spongy layer of leaf litter. As earthworms feast on that layer, they allow nonnative plants such as European buckthorn and grasses to thrive, which in turn push out endemic plants. This process, combined with the effects of warming over time, may slowly transform Minnesota’s boreal forest into prairie, Mr. Wackett said. “Even though worms themselves are tiny and don’t individually seem to constitute a threat, when you think of how many of them there are, they’re very important organisms, for the good or the bad,” said Mr. Wackett. Last summer, Mr. Wackett and his supervisor, Kyungsoo Yoo, a soil scientist at the University of Minnesota, found that invasive earthworms also have spread to parts of Alaska’s boreal forest, including the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. In severely affected areas, the biomass of earthworms underground is 500 times greater than the biomass of moose in the same areas. Even where earthworms were sparse, they still matched the biomass of moose, which is considered a keystone species in Alaska. To his horror, Dr. Yoo also found earthworms right on the edge of the permafrost in the northern boreal. The pace of permafrost melt and its release of carbon is of great concern to researchers who model climate change. His biggest concern is that earthworms will penetrate even further north in the boreal and spread into the permafrost. “Their impact alone could be quite devastating, based on what we have been seeing in Minnesota and New England and in parts of Canada,” said Dr. Yoo. No mechanism exists to eradicate earthworms from the boreal forest; their impact is permanent. However, earthworms move less than 30 feet a year on their own. Educating people to not transport them into unaffected parts of the forest might help keep those areas earthworm-free, said Mr. Wackett. As scientists analyze the effects of the earthworms they know about, they also are keeping an eye on a new invader: Asian earthworms, which have made their way to southern Quebec and Ontario. “I’m not sure what their implications are for carbon, but they’re pretty aggressive and they seem potentially to be better competitors than European earthworms,” said Dr. Cameron. “That’s another issue on the horizon.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Echo in the Canyon’ Review: Capturing a California Musical Moment,"Stars from bands of the 1960s and beyond share their memories of a time and place that made lasting changes in popular music. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The delight of “Echo in the Canyon” is in the delicious details its subjects impart. Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas remembers Brian Wilson’s living room, a piano planted on the sand-covered floor as he wrote the Beach Boys’ influential “Pet Sounds” album; Tom Petty notes that “Pet Sounds” was considered to be responsible for “Sgt. Pepper”; a white-maned David Crosby reveals why he was ejected from the Byrds; and the narrator, the singer-songwriter Jakob Dylan, coaxes Stephen Stills to tell an embarrassing story about sneaking out the back when the police broke up one of the Laurel Canyon house party/jam sessions where the performers tried out their music, inspired each other’s work and got high. The musicians were drawn — and dazzled — by the array of recording studios in Los Angeles and built a neighborhood in the canyon. They agree the peak of this period of change occupied a precise slice of the mid-’60s, before the psychedelic era. The Byrds were central to the scene, but their frontman, Roger McGuinn, makes the transformation they accomplished sound deceptively simple. Between honeyed acoustic guitar riffs, he explains that he merely “souped up” some folk chords with a Beatles beat. Crosby, explaining as well as anyone the significance of the synthesis of rock ’n’ roll and folk that happened in Laurel Canyon, said: “We were putting good poetry on the radio, AM radio.” The film, directed by Andrew Slater, centers on a 2015 50th-anniversary concert paying tribute to the music of Laurel Canyon and featuring artists of the next generation, including Cat Power, Beck and Norah Jones. But far more satisfying — and too few — were the snippets of the originals and clips like the present-day studio recording of Stills and Eric Clapton playing together. Echo in the Canyon Not rated.

2019,‘El Chicano’ Review: Freeing East Los Angeles With Bloodshed,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In the ultraviolent east Los Angeles epic “El Chicano,” a police officer, Diego Hernandez (Raúl Castillo), finds himself at a moral crossroads when he unearths a connection between his late brother, Pedro, and the execution-style killing of local gang members. As Diego dives into Pedro’s past, he enters a punishing street war that quickly becomes painful to watch. In Pedro’s journals, Diego discovers a plan to recreate El Chicano, a masked vigilante who terrorized the gangs of the brothers’ youth. Though Diego is at first disturbed by his brother’s references to Mexican-American revolution, the escalating bloodshed in his community soon drives Diego to take up the mask his brother left behind. [With its mostly Latino cast, “El Chicano” struggled to find backers in Hollywood.] As El Chicano, Diego adopts a ferocious approach to fighting crime, training his body to be a weapon alongside his guns. The director Ben Hernandez Bray began his career in Hollywood as a stuntman, and though too many bones are crunched to describe this film as elegant, Bray directs action with merciless kinetic logic. The physical effect of violence in this film is made abundantly clear, but the political and thematic purpose of including such brutality remains murky. Neighbors, childhood friends and family members clash, but the supposed heroes are as ruthless as the villains. Bray seems to want to portray a culturally specific version of Mexican-American identity — complete with a mostly Mexican-American cast, on both sides of the law — but it’s hard to be entertained by the spectacle of brutality when campiness is entirely absent. Here, when cop fists meet cartel skulls, the impact feels sickening, and it’s no less sadistic when the roles are reversed.

2019,‘Empire’ Season 6 Will Be the Show’s Last,"The next season of the Fox hip-hop drama “Empire” will be its last, the network revealed in a surprise announcement early Monday morning. The decision comes just months after Jussie Smollett, one of the show’s stars, was at the center of a national controversy over whether he staged an attack that he had described as a hate crime. Fox made the announcement as it unveiled its upcoming lineup for the 2019-20 television schedule. “Empire” is heading into its sixth season and has seen declining ratings in recent years, pushing the former hit show out of the top 10 network entertainment series. Fox executives declined to say if the decision to end “Empire” had anything to do with Smollett’s recent imbroglio. “We’re excited to see to this show go out with a bang,” Fox Entertainment’s chief executive, Charlie Collier, said in a conference call with the news media, adding that six seasons “is a pretty remarkable run for a drama series.” But Smollett’s status on the next season of the series had become the source of a disagreement between the stars of the show and its producers and executives. In April, much of the cast of “Empire,” including its two lead actors, Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, signed a letter of support asking for Smollett to return. Producers and executives declined, saying there were “no plans” for him to come back, even as they negotiated an extension on his option, leaving the door open for a return later in the season. “Empire” became the subject of intense national focus after Smollett said he was attacked by two men shouting homophobic slurs in the middle of the night in Chicago in late January. Within weeks, the Chicago police accused Smollett of staging the attack, in part because he was upset about his salary on the Fox drama. Prosecutors later dropped all charges against Smollett, angering both the police and Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Smollett was written out of the final two episodes of the most recent “Empire” season, and producers were reluctant to commit to ever having him come back. After Smollett’s option was extended, a representative for the actor said late last month that he appreciated that producers had left his “future open.” Now with the show down to its final season, his possible return could represent less of a threat to the series if executives were concerned about a backlash. There were certainly other complicating factors involving the show’s future. “Empire” was going to be more expensive to the Fox broadcast network this upcoming season than in years past. With the Walt Disney Company now owning most of Fox’s entertainment properties, including its TV studio, the network has to pay a hefty license fee to air the show. The series has also shed viewers in recent years. In its latest season, it dropped 23 percent in the ratings and is currently in a tie for 17th place among network entertainment shows, along with the ABC drama “A Million Little Things.” “Empire” came on the air in January 2015 and became an instant hit. The soapy hip-hop drama gained in viewers every week in its first season, and was a source of celebration among all network executives, pointing to it as evidence that the broadcast networks were still capable of generating huge hits. (Few new shows have been able to replicate its success since, with the exception of NBC’s “This Is Us,” which debuted in 2016, and Fox’s “The Masked Singer,” which came on the air earlier this year.) As part of Monday’s announcement, Fox also said that “Empire” would change time slots, moving from Wednesdays at 8 p.m. to Tuesday nights at 9. That would pit “Empire” against “This Is Us.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Every Day I Fear’: Asylum Seekers Await Their Fate in a Clogged System,"President Trump wants to discourage asylum claims, as immigration courts deal with a backlog of more than 800,000 cases. Here are four of them. [Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.] They traveled thousands of miles and endured dangerous — and at times unimaginable — conditions on their journeys. They fled domestic violence, vengeful gangs, political opposition and laws that made their lives unbearable. In droves, migrants have arrived at the United States’ southern border claiming to have fled oppressive conditions in their home countries. Today, more than 800,000 await proceedings that could put them on the path to American citizenship. But in a memo this week intended to discourage migrants — most of whom began their treks in Central America — President Trump ordered sweeping changes to the asylum process, an already byzantine system in which asylum seekers often wait years for their cases to be adjudicated because of a bottleneck in the immigration courts. Among the directives: Asylum seekers would have to pay a fee to apply. And those who entered the country illegally would be barred from receiving work permits while their cases were adjudicated, which Mr. Trump said must happen within 180 days. It could be months before the measures, which are likely to face legal challenges, take effect. Although only a small number of applicants ultimately win asylum, the orders could hurt those with legitimate claims, said critics of the directives. We asked four people who are awaiting asylum hearings about their cases, and how they have fared in the United States. Name, age, country: Wendy, 27, El Salvador Asylum claim: Wendy said she and her son were sexually assaulted by gang members in retaliation for her brother’s cooperation with law enforcement. Time in the United States: Three years Work permit: Yes In 2015, Wendy fled to the United States with her three children, including her 2-month-old daughter; she said she and her oldest child had been tied up and raped by gangs. Wendy had to undergo reconstructive anal surgery, she said, and her son, who was 8 at the time, was severely traumatized. He continues to suffer from psychotic episodes and depression, which have led him to engage in acts of self-harm, she said. His hand bears scars from cutting himself with a plastic soda bottle. In February, an immigration judge approved her asylum case, pending the completion of a biometric examination. Once her case is finalized, Wendy and her three children will be eligible for permanent legal residency in the United States. “Oh my God, I cried of joy. I felt so happy. I felt grateful,” said Wendy, who asked that neither her last name nor her son’s name be published, for fear that her family could face retribution from MS-13 gang members. “We would die if we were forced to return to El Salvador. We had the need for protection from this country.” According to current immigration regulations, asylum seekers are entitled to legally work in the United States once their asylum application has been pending for 180 days. Wendy, who packs fruits and vegetables, said that working while her case was under review has meant feeding her family, paying rent and affording medication for her son. Wendy’s lawyer, Eileen Blessinger, said that many of her clients would have to rely on friends, family and charity if they were prohibited from working. Lack of income poses barriers to retaining a lawyer and obtaining a driver’s license, and it compels people to work in the underground economy, she said. Name, age, country: Mamadou, 41, Guinea Asylum claim: Mamadou was a high-profile activist who was targeted by the opposition party in his country, and whose family endured violence as a result of his political opinions. Time in the United States: Five years Work permit: Yes Government soldiers in Guinea who were determined to capture Mamadou poured scalding oil on his baby when they came searching for him in his family’s home in 2015, he claimed. Mamadou was already in the United States, where he had applied for asylum. If the activist, who lives in the Bronx, wins his case, his family can join him. But three years later, his case has not yet been reviewed by a judge. “Every second, every day I fear for the safety of my child and wife,” said Mamadou, who asked that his last name be withheld out of concern for his family. “I am very distressed. So much time has already passed, and the situation in my country is only getting worst.” His lawyer, Carmen Maria Rey, is confident that her client has a strong claim, if only it would be adjudicated. Name, age and country: Denis Davydov, 32, Russia Asylum claim: Mr. Davydov, who is gay and H.I.V. positive, left his country because L.G.B.T. individuals face increasingly harsh treatment there. Time in the United States: Four and a half years Work permit: Yes Mr. Davydov, who is living in San Jose, Calif., has been waiting since the spring of 2015 for his asylum case to be heard. Two years ago, he was detained by customs agents who believed he had overstayed his visa. He was held in detention in Miami for 45 days before he was released. His next hearing is scheduled for July. He said being an L.G.B.T. individual in Russia put him at risk of increasingly harsh treatment, from everyday discrimination on the street to threats and beatings. He said he had also struggled to receive adequate treatment for his illness. “I was told in a clinic they could not give me any medication because they didn’t have them. It was the last straw. It was devastating,” he said. “As a teenager, I was always questioned and bullied for being gay. And I was beaten. But all these laws started coming in. Before you could hide, but now, everywhere, it is the most popular topic. It became just a nightmare.” Today, Mr. Davydov works as a certified sommelier. “It makes me so happy,” he said. “It is my dream.” Name, age, country: Maria Meza, 40, Honduras Asylum claim: Violence against her family. Time in the United States: Four months Work permit: No Maria Meza was seeking a safe haven from gang violence in Honduras when she decided to journey north with a migrant caravan to Tijuana, Mexico, late last year. In December, Ms. Meza and two of her daughters were among hundreds of asylum seekers who were tear gassed by the Border Patrol as they approached the border. Officials said that the officers fired tear gas because the migrants were mounting an assault. A photograph of Ms. Meza and her children fleeing plumes of tear gas went viral. Ultimately, she and her children were allowed to enter the United States through a port of entry at Otay Mesa, Calif., where they requested protection in the United States with the assistance of lawyers and members of Congress. Immigration authorities fitted Ms. Meza with an ankle monitor to track her movements and issued her a notice to appear in court — on a date that has not been scheduled — so that she could formally request asylum. She has been reporting every two weeks to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as required. However, until her case is filed with the court, she is not eligible for a work permit. “I ask God to give me an opportunity for asylum,” she said in an interview. While she waits, churches, synagogues and community organizations have provided her with financial assistance. “Without the support of all these people, I would be going hungry.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile’ Review: Killing Me Softly","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Leaning into his hotness with surprising dexterity, Zac Efron plays the notoriously charming serial killer Ted Bundy like someone who has always understood how to weaponize a pretty face. So the problem with the biopic “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” isn’t Efron (or that cumbersome title), but his director, Joe Berlinger. Working ostensibly from the viewpoint of Bundy’s longtime girlfriend, Liz Kendall (an excellent Lily Collins), Berlinger never fully commits. Instead, he appears as seduced by Bundy as virtually everyone else in the movie. Only animals, the film suggests, can resist the killer’s allure, as we watch a whimpering dog back away when Bundy and Liz visit the pound. Even the judge in his televised 1979 murder trial (played, delightfully, by John Malkovich) seems as spellbound as the gallery filled with fluttering young women. “Bless your heart,” he remarks to the showboating defendant, complimenting his legal skills and passively tolerating Bundy’s impromptu marriage proposal to one of the witnesses. Scenes like these strike an unfortunate comedic note that undercuts the seriousness of Berlinger’s point: that devils may come disguised as angels. In documentaries like his stunning “Paradise Lost” trilogy, he has repeatedly interrogated our flawed ability to accurately identify monsters, chipping away at our biases to expose their fragility. Yet while Bundy’s well-documented charisma is on full blast here, we only fleetingly feel its chill. And by leaving most of his heinous acts off screen, Berlinger (who also has a Bundy documentary, “Conversations With a Killer,” on Netflix) is apparently relying on unwitting audiences being as devastated by his guilt as poor Liz. All this makes for a very odd picture, one that purports to care about the women Bundy duped — including Carole Ann Boone (Kaya Scodelario), who married him and had his daughter — while simultaneously marveling at their gullibility. Efron’s smoothly manipulative performance makes a mockery of their devotion, so much so that at times the movie appears less about the psychology of a specific sociopath than a general comment on women who shield such men and even hanker after them. This longing to touch the flame and tame the dragon could have made for a fascinating thread in the familiar serial-killer narrative, but “Extremely Wicked” (the title comes from the judge’s characterization of Bundy’s crimes) is too unfocused and lacking in imagination to pick it up. Early scenes detailing Liz and Bundy’s 1969 meeting and happy homemaking with her small daughter are followed by years of arrests, escapes and multistate charges for his still-unseen crimes. The final third leaves Liz to her drinking and depression as the movie transforms into a courtroom procedural and a showcase for Bundy’s strutting self-confidence. Blurring documentary and drama with the overused tic of playing real-life footage over the end credits, Berlinger still leaves Bundy no more than a slick enigma. It’s the same problem that dogged the director’s excessively flattering 2016 portrait of the motivational speaker Tony Robbins: at a certain point, we realize that Berlinger might simply be unable or unwilling to look beyond the dazzle.

2019,Opinion | ‘Feminine Weakness’ Is a Scam,"THE big ideas: What is power? Power is the strength necessary to live in a world rife with misogyny. Ms. Mackintosh is a novelist. I wrote my first novel at a time when I felt powerless. I was 27 in 2016, and there was a public reckoning happening with women’s bodies, but also a reckoning I was grappling with personally. I had felt so powerless in my body for such a long time that by then there was a comfort to be found in passivity, in going through the motions. I was dimly aware that there was another, stronger me somewhere, but I could barely see or remember her. I felt skinless, afraid. Writing a book laid bare my own reckoning, made me feel worse for a time. But it also opened me to the experience of bridging the gap between powerlessness and power. I wrote, and people read — my words carried weight. Similarly, to have a body, especially as a woman, means to experience that space between power and powerlessness, as determined by the template on which the world has been built: a cisgender white man’s body. Consider how much strength is needed to deal with the onslaught of living in a world rife with misogyny, the mental load of constant damage assessments. In that light, the idea of feminine weakness comes across as no more than a scam, a purposeful downplaying of the power embedded within the historic (and current) concept of the hysterical woman, the terrifying woman, righteously angry. We cannot escape the fact that non-male pain is consistently underestimated. This is well documented, even in a world where measuring pain is nebulous, necessarily contingent on personal levels of what is bearable. I have seen my own friends disregarded by doctors again and again. One, for example, was told by a male doctor that she was overreacting to the pain of a ruptured cyst the size of an orange. Men present with heart attacks differently from women, and so their cardiac events are often missed. This is power. I hear and read stories of miscarriage, of labor injuries that caused broken pelvises, PTSD, incontinence, but I have to search them out, I am told them in whispers, as if there is a conspiracy about talking about these things. This is power, too. And then there are the workplaces that don’t allow for difference, that still base everything on the default male, reward based on the default male, even down to health and safety measures. Just recently, NASA’s plans for its first all-female spacewalk fell through because of a lack of suits in the right size. Elsewhere, we see women’s anger demonized and men’s placated. We have to prove ourselves calm, over and over and over, if we want to be taken seriously. I think about the background noise of our collective consciousness under patriarchy: assessing for violence, checking in with others, taking precautions. It can be hard to hear over — sometimes it is a hum, other times it is an alarm. Violence under patriarchy is not theoretical. The memory of it lives in my body, like it lives in countless other bodies. It forms its own tissue and knots. It’s important to remember that women, too, can contribute to our powerlessness. Britain has seen a worrying increase of prominent and mainstream feminists reducing everything to biology as a way to dismiss the experiences of trans people. When women align themselves with right-wing, patriarchal ideologies about the right to exist within one’s own body, it is a key example of privilege and power working in tandem with other privileges and powers. Women collude. Women diminish. Women can still wield power destructively, and recognizing this — our capacity to do harm — is necessary if we are to own our power. Moving away from the default of the cisgender white man requires opening up, not closing ranks. It requires accepting and respecting bodies, finding new ways for bodies to feel safe. I think of the things I have done to make my body feel more safe to me. My weight-lifting period, my starvation period, my deeply reckless period. Even doing terrible things to my body has been a kind of privilege. Not everybody gets to self-destruct and come back. All for what? Experiments in power, in testing limits? To know that whatever happens externally, I can exert my own power on something, anything? I do have power, of course. I always did. I can’t do anything immediate about the background noise; I can’t pretend to ignore the danger of walking through a dark place alone. But neither can I be passive anymore. I have the strength to fight through pain. I have a body that lets me experience power in all its forms. I understand my own power, and I can do my best to use it for good, however that means — to support others to the best of my ability, to try to encourage new writers, to give of my money and time. To work toward a world where righteous anger cannot be disregarded.

2019,‘Fetal Heartbeat’ vs. ‘Forced Pregnancy’: The Language Wars of the Abortion Debate,"The new laws that prohibit abortion as early as the sixth week of pregnancy have been called “heartbeat” legislation by supporters, a reference to the flickering pulse that can be seen on ultrasound images of a developing embryo. But when the American Civil Liberties Union announced a legal challenge last week to one such law in Ohio, there was no mention of the word “heartbeat” in the news release, which referred to the law instead as “a ban on almost all abortions.” In Georgia, Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who narrowly lost the governor’s race last year, called the measure in her state a “forced pregnancy bill.” A sign at a protest against the law in Atlanta this week turned the idea into a slogan: “NO FORCED BIRTHS.” The battle over abortion has long been shaped by language. After abortion opponents coined the “pro-life” phrase in the 1960s to emphasize what they saw as the humanity of the fetus, supporters of abortion cast themselves as “pro-choice” to stress a woman’s right to make decisions about her body. In the mid-1990s, the term “partial-birth abortion,” originated by the anti-abortion group National Right to Life, helped rally public opinion against a late-term abortion procedure. Abortion rights activists countered with “Trust Women.” But the stakes attached to the language of abortion are especially high, activists on both sides say, at a time when the Supreme Court is seen as likely to chip away at the right to an abortion established in 1973 by Roe v. Wade. It was no accident, for instance, that Ohio’s leading anti-abortion group, Ohio Right to Life, invoked the term “heartbeat” eight times in 300 words in a news release welcoming the A.C.L.U.’s legal challenge, said the group’s president, Mike Gonidakis. The idea that life begins at conception, an axiom for many anti-abortion activists, Mr. Gonidakis said, does not have the same capacity to mobilize “the average person on the street” as the symbolism of a heart. “When we say, ‘Protect babies with a beating heart,’ we’ve found a way to overcome that tsunami of messaging from Planned Parenthood,” Mr. Gonidakis said of the prominent abortion rights group. “The power of words and repeating those words over and over again helps steer the debate and move the needle in your favor.” As abortion opponents push the term “fetal heartbeat,” abortion rights activists are trying to galvanize support by focusing on the impact the recently passed bans can have on people’s lives. On a culture-war battleground where many Americans have already chosen a side, experts say, effective messaging can be the catalyst that mobilizes people on either one — in addition to reaching the undecided. “‘Heartbeat’ bills are obviously supposed to pull at your heartstrings, and the left is coming back with terms like ‘punishing women’ and ‘forced pregnancy,’” said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian at Florida State University and the author of “After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate.” “The rhetoric seems to be getting more and more extreme on both sides,” she added. Abortion rights advocates say their own polling and analysis has shown that their messaging has been overly focused on concepts like the right to choose and protecting women’s privacy, which were the foundation of 1970s and 1980s-era activism aimed at right-leaning voters opposed to government intervention in people’s lives. Even the term “abortion,” they say, was stigmatized in the late 1990s with the “safe, legal and rare” tagline, used by President Bill Clinton to describe the Democrats’ policy outlook on abortion. Describing abortion as needing to be rare implied incorrectly, in the eyes of advocates, that there was something inherently wrong with having an abortion. Now, individual stories of abortion are increasingly being aired under hashtags like #ShoutYourAbortion and #YouKnowMe, and the goal among many activist groups is to use more straightforward language that shifts the focus from the fetus to the person who is pregnant. “We don’t use the term ‘anti-choice’ anymore,” said Destiny Lopez, a co-director of All Above All, a reproductive rights advocacy group. “That’s a euphemism that is outdated. We say anti-abortion, and what is the impact of being anti-abortion? It’s forcing someone to remain pregnant.” Abortion opponents have long stressed what they believe is the humanity of a fetus, protesting at rallies and in front of abortion clinics with signs that read “Abortion Stops a Beating Heart.” In some states, people are required to view ultrasound images before getting an abortion. “Fetal heartbeat” is a term often used by obstetricians with patients as a shorthand — but one many doctors never expected would become so politicized. One criticism of the “heartbeat” language, abortion rights supporters say, is that it obscures the science of how an embryo develops. What is detected on an ultrasound taken early in pregnancy, obstetricians say, is an electrical pulse in a group of cells the size of a pencil tip. To function as a heart would require further development of its structure, as well as a neurological system, among other things. “This is nothing like what we would think of as a four-chambered heart,” said Sarah Horvath, a family planning fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who performs abortions. “The scientific words are getting conflated with a term that has emotional significance.” Even when a law is described as banning abortions at six or eight weeks, some abortion rights advocates worry there is the potential for confusion. Doctors measure the start of pregnancy from the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period, which is usually two weeks before conception. As a result, some of the new laws would ban abortion as early as two weeks after a missed period, before many women realize they are pregnant. But arguing on scientific or technical grounds has not proved especially effective for abortion rights supporters in the past. Medical explanations of the term “partial birth abortion” in the late 1990s — a time when the number of Americans who said that abortion should be legal under all circumstances had dropped, to about one in four from one in three — did not prevent a ban of the procedure under federal law in 2003. The phrase refers to a later-term abortion procedure known as dilation and extraction. Anti-abortion activists have also successfully pushed for bans on a procedure used in the vast majority of second-trimester abortions by labeling it “dismemberment abortion.” Doctors call the procedure a dilation and evacuation. The bans are in effect in two states, West Virginia and Mississippi. “Medical procedures are not familiar to a lay audience, people don’t like to think about them, and they are hard to explain on a bumper sticker,” said Carole Joffe, a sociologist who studies abortion politics at the University of California, San Francisco. “That has put the pro-choice movement at a disadvantage.” Slogans about keeping abortions “safe and legal” are fine, said Andrea Miller, an abortion rights supporter and president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, but fail to evoke the emotion that abortion rights opponents have managed to unleash. “When you zoom out from the legalese and you ground it in real people’s lives, you see greater support and mobilization.” Mr. Gonidakis, of Ohio Right to Life, said he had taken note of some of the new terminology being floated by abortion rights proponents, like the #StopTheBans hashtag and references to “forced birth.” “I’m not saying it’s not powerful,” he said. “I’m just saying, saving a baby with a beating heart is more powerful.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Fight if You Must’: Students Take a Front-Line Role in School Shootings,"The two shootings were separated by seven days and more than 1,500 miles, but the details seemed eerily familiar: When a gunman charged into a classroom, a student went barreling toward him, preventing more bloodshed while sacrificing his life. At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, it was Riley Howell, 21. At the STEM School in Highlands Ranch, Colo., it was Kendrick Castillo, 18. The two young men were hailed as heroes for assuming the unimaginable role of emergency responder to a school shooting. Their actions, credited by the authorities with saving the lives of classmates, suggest that some members of America’s mass-shooting generation have learned to act — by instinct or intention — as professionals would in the face of deadly tragedy. “I think everybody has this idea, ‘What if somebody comes in with a gun? What do I do?’” said Brendan Bialy, 18, who said he helped disarm the Colorado shooting suspect, a fellow student, after Mr. Castillo charged him. “I didn’t think consciously, ‘I’d do this and then this.’ It just happened.” [Read more here about Kendrick Castillo, who was remembered as being “always the first to help.”] Drills for what to do during a shooting have become routine in schools across the nation, in some cases for children as young as in kindergarten. Most students have not been taught to directly confront shooting suspects, but rather to focus on what they must do to remain safe. Some young people, however, appear to have closely followed past massacres and concluded that they cannot wait for a teacher or security officer to protect them. “The idea of ‘run, hide, fight’ is what they teach,” said Don Gilmore, whose son Spencer escaped unharmed from the shooting at STEM School on Tuesday and was friends with some of the students who tried to subdue one of the attackers. “Run if you can. Hide if you need to. And fight if you must. Some people are just wired to react to that situation.” Spencer’s mother, Sarah, said she had spent part of the evening after the shooting thinking about how, had her son been in a different classroom that afternoon, Spencer might have been one of the students charging into gunfire. “They saved it from being much worse,” she said. Even younger children were prepared to take action. Nate Holley, a sixth-grader at the school, recounted to CNN how his teacher moved the class into a closet during the shooting. Standing in the corner, Nate got ready. “I had my hand on a metal baseball bat, just in case,” said Nate, 12. “Cause I was going to go down fighting if I was going to go down.” The thought of a child formulating a plan to attack a gunman with nothing more than a baseball bat may seem horrifying. But people like Greg Crane, whose company trains law enforcement on how to handle active shooters, say that when escape is not an option, confrontation might make sense. “We do conduct training about taking back control,” said Mr. Crane, who created a training program called “Alice,” or Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate. “Often it gets called ‘fighting back.’ There’s no fighting strategies taught; it’s ‘How do you control this out-of-control person?’” He frequently cites as inspiration Jacob Ryker, who tackled a gunman at his Oregon high school in 1998, despite getting shot himself. “It’s never been a question of whether kids can do it,” Mr. Crane said. “It’s just I think with predominantly more training on responses to violent events going on all over, yes, we would expect to see hopefully more of this.” [Read more about Riley Howell, the U.N.C. Charlotte student who sacrificed his life to save others.] But not all training methods promote similar action — some endorse more running and hiding than fighting — and drills vary widely among school districts. What academics who study school violence have learned from their research is that what matters most is that the drills do not traumatize children, said Beverly Kingston, the director of the Center for the Study and the Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado Boulder. “It matters the way the training is done and how it’s done,” Dr. Kingston said. “It can either add to the trauma or reduce the trauma. We always want to do it in ways that reduce the trauma.” Even more important is focusing on ways to prevent violence, she added, deploying threat assessment teams with multiple approaches to help people who are troubled. One way to identify those potential threats is to give communities — especially students, parents and teachers — the ability to anonymously report concerns that do not rise to the level of, say, calling 911. “It’s not only this mass violence — it’s also increases in suicide,” Dr. Kingston said. “How are we working together as a nation to put into place programs that we know are proven to work when someone is suffering? That’s the harder question, but we really have to ask ourselves that hard question.” [Here’s the list of school shootings so far this year.] Susan Payne, who after the Columbine shooting founded Safe2Tell, a youth violence prevention initiative in Colorado, lamented that, 20 years later, schools have still not adopted a consistent approach to try to prevent mass shootings. “We can do a better job in this country, and I think we’ve seen a lot of movement in the aftermath of the Parkland tragedy,” said Ms. Payne, who worked in law enforcement for 28 years. “We need to get in earlier, and we need to realize that the culture and climate in a school is so important.” She attributed some students’ instinct to confront an armed attacker to depictions of heroism in popular culture. “Young people today are more informed than we even realize, and it’s through their own social norms and information they see in television, movies and online,” she said. “And I think kids are having that conversation at lunchroom tables, talking of what they might do.” Mr. Bialy, the STEM School senior, described the takedown of the gunman as an effort among Mr. Castillo, himself and a third boy he declined to name, citing the boy’s wishes. Mr. Castillo was closest to the shooting suspect, about a foot away, when the suspect walked into their English class. Once Mr. Castillo got up, so did Mr. Bialy and the other boy. They slammed the gunman against the wall. He fired his pistol once or twice in the skirmish, hitting Mr. Castillo. Students tried to tend to him, but he was unresponsive, Mr. Bialy said. “Kendrick refused to be a victim,” Mr. Bialy said. Mr. Castillo’s father, John Castillo, told The Denver Post through tears that he was not surprised by his son’s decision to go after the gunman, though he wished he had acted differently and perhaps survived. “I wish he had gone and hid,” Mr. Castillo said, “but that’s not his character. His character is about protecting people, helping people.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Fleabag’ Is (Finally) Back. Here’s a Refresher.,"Everything you need to know from Season 1, just in time for the long-awaited Season 2. It’s been a long time since the first season of the dark British comedy series “Fleabag” arrived in the U.S. on Amazon Prime Video — nearly three years, in fact. The creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been busy in that time, launching the hit thriller “Killing Eve” and reviving the stage version of “Fleabag” for Off Broadway audiences, but the wait is finally over. Season 2 (which Waller-Bridge has said will be the last) premieres Friday on Amazon and picks up right where the first season left off, so you’ll probably want a refresher. Here’s what you’ll need to remember about the fourth wall-breaking Fleabag (we never do learn her real name), the sardonic manager of a failing, guinea pig-themed London cafe. Flashbacks reveal Fleabag opened the cafe with her best friend, Boo (Jenny Rainsford), who recently died after walking into traffic. At different points, Fleabag makes the case that Boo didn’t mean to kill herself, and in one flashback, Boo says she wanted get a minor injury that might elicit her cheating boyfriend’s sympathy. Though the show resolutely remains a comedy (especially in the first half of the season), as the story develops, it gradually becomes clear that Boo’s death weighs heavily on Fleabag. A few years previously, Fleabag’s mother died. Fleabag and her sister Claire (Sian Clifford) are dealing with their grief differently; Fleabag dates a lot of different men and presides halfheartedly over her cafe, which is home to a resident guinea pig named Hilary. Claire, on the other hand, is a driven overachiever who stays with her husband, Martin (Brett Gelman), despite the fact that at Claire’s birthday party, he tried to kiss Fleabag. One pastime the sisters enthusiastically share is reveling in their dislike of their stepmother, who is only ever called “godmother” and is played with delicious venom by Olivia Colman. Godmother is a talented artist who makes it clear to her stepdaughters that she controls their father’s life and they had better not mess with her. All of this grinding irritation and mutual dislike is conveyed via amusing British repression. A good bit of the season revolves around a small statue of a woman’s torso that Fleabag stole from Godmother’s home studio. Fleabag asks Martin to sell it, but he gives it to Claire for her birthday instead. After Fleabag secretly returns the piece to the studio — Godmother can’t prove Fleabag took it, but she clearly suspects her — Claire steals it back again, mainly because Colman’s character is vicious to the sisters at a lunch meant to celebrate the memory of their late mother. Fleabag’s father (Bill Paterson) tries to keep the peace between his wife and daughters, but his hopes for harmony among them are dashed at Godmother’s “Sexhibition,” an art show at which Fleabag is pressured into serving drinks. Late in the party, she smashes several glasses in front of guests, but Godmother’s fury at this rebellion is not the worst part of Fleabag’s night. Her father makes it clear that he wants his new marriage to work, Fleabag’s ex shows up with a new girlfriend and the hot, rather dim guy Fleabag has been dating casually dumps her. Worst of all, Claire tells Fleabag that she believes the story she’s been told by Martin: That Fleabag kissed him at Claire’s birthday party, not the other way around. During the confrontation between Claire and Fleabag at the Sexhibition party, Claire alludes to a fact that is established firmly via flashbacks: Fleabag is the one who slept with Boo’s boyfriend. The comedy swerves into tragic territory by revealing that this entire time, despite her frankness about everything else, Fleabag has been secretly racked with guilt about possibly causing her best friend’s death. The morning after the “Sexhibition” party, Fleabag stands on the curb in front of the cafe and considers walking into traffic just as Boo did. Her bank manager (Hugh Dennis), who appeared in a couple of installments (including a memorable trip to a meditation retreat), rolls up in his car and asks if she’s O.K. She’s not, but he gently reminds Fleabag that everyone makes mistakes. And very late in the game, he realizes that he was mistaken about the nature of Fleabag’s business: The cafe has a guinea-pig decorative theme, and is not designed for the small mammals.",The New York Times
2019,‘For the Birds’ Review: From an Overcrowded Chicken Coop Springs Unusual Life,"Critic’s Pick What makes the film stand out is its editing, which carefully builds a story from multiple perspectives. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. When Richard Miron began filming his indelible documentary, “For the Birds,” his subjects, Kathy Murphy and her husband, Gary, were living alongside a collection of some 200 chickens, geese, ducks and turkeys. The birds had spilled out from their makeshift coops on the lawn. To Kathy’s delight and Gary’s disgust, they had filled their mobile home with the sounds, stinks and scum of the coop. Miron met Kathy in 2011, when he was working as a volunteer for the Woodstock Farm Sanctuary. Miron followed with his camera as shelter workers attempted to negotiate with Kathy for the release of her pets. But Kathy’s devotion to her birds — and her fervor in protecting the life she built with them — soon fascinated Miron, whose film contemplates the impact of Kathy’s fixation. “For the Birds” sticks with Kathy for more than five years, documenting the personal and legal consequences of Kathy’s passion, observing her fowl obsession with equal parts curiosity, care and guilty revulsion. Miron’s vérité footage is grainy — reflecting the flimsy quality of the digital cameras that were readily available at the start of the decade — and the story is hyper-local, focused on a tiny community in rural New York. But what makes “For the Birds” stand out is its editing, which carefully builds a story from multiple perspectives, sympathizing with Kathy, Gary and the workers at the Woodstock Farm Sanctuary. Miron avoids easy conclusions about what drives Kathy, and he stays with her long enough for her story to surprise. The reward of his patience is a psychological portrait that develops mystery the more it reveals. From filth springs life — no less precious for its muddy origins. For the Birds Not rated.

2019,‘Fox and His Friends’: Fassbinder’s Tale of Bad Romance,"The prodigiously talented German film director cast himself as a working-class hustler who wins the lottery but loses his head to love. Not simply a great filmmaker, Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1945-82) was an imposing physical presence. I vividly remember a stocky, scruffy, leather-clad figure, flanked by an entourage, striding across the lobby of Alice Tully Hall for a New York Film Festival news conference in the late 1970s. The German auteur — a wildly prolific wunderkind whose sardonic melodramas served to re-establish German cinema on the international stage — appeared at once affable and menacing. It was an affect far different from the one he chose a few years earlier for his movie “Fox and His Friends” (1975). Not quite 30, the director cast himself as a working-class hustler, boyish and naïve, who performs in a traveling circus as Fox the Talking Head. After winning a lottery jackpot of 500,000 marks (roughly $1 million these days) he loses his head to love — shamelessly exploited by a bourgeois male lover, Eugen (Peter Chatel), who takes his money while berating him for not using a dessert fork. As a portrait of class relations, “Fox and His Friends” is not subtle. (Fox’s real name, Franz Biberkopf, is a reference to the victimized proletarian antihero of Alfred Döblin’s great novel “Berlin Alexanderplatz.”) But the film is no less affecting for that. Fassbinder avails himself of blunt Brechtian political allegory as well as his knowledge of the Hollywood melodramatist Douglas Sirk, particularly Sirk’s use of interior décor to comment on his characters’ emotional states. Every object in the frame is precisely placed to drive the point home. The mood of acrid self-pity is further reinforced by the occasional use of Leonard Cohen’s melancholy dirge “Bird on the Wire.” Fassbinder once wrote that Sirk’s films convinced him that “love is the best, most insidious, most effective instrument of social control.” So it is with “Fox.” The movie’s title could have been that of a subsequent film “I Only Want You to Love Me” — precisely Fox’s motivation as he lends money to bail out Eugen’s father’s business, as well as buying (and furnishing) an apartment, a new wardrobe and a fancy car. “Fox” evokes the cruelty of a dog-eat-dog world. A major scene is set in Marrakesh, where Fox has taken Eugen on vacation. The two men pick up a Moroccan (El Hedi Ben Salem, the male lead in Fassbinder’s “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul”) and take him back to their luxury hotel only to be informed that Arabs are not allowed. Of course, after the Moroccan is escorted out, the desk clerk offers to send a hotel employee to their room. Love is a commodity; social class is absolute. The idea that West Germany might also be a sort of colony is introduced by the presence of two American soldiers whom Fox vainly attempts to hustle. Despite its outrageously downbeat ending, “Fox” was promoted at the 1975 New York Film Festival as a daring display of “homosexuality without tears” — presumably because the movie is so matter-of-fact in representing its gay milieu. Four decades ago, “Fox” was something of a novelty, as was Fassbinder, perhaps the first openly gay or bisexual filmmaker of note since Jean Cocteau. The New York Times critic Vincent Canby, an important supporter of Fassbinder’s work, chose not to review “Fox,” first shown as “Fist-Right of Freedom”; the movie was dismissed in The Times by Richard Eder as “a ‘Blue Angel’ done in drag.” When “Fox” opened commercially in New York it was at the Waverly (the same Greenwich Village theater where, two months later, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” appeared), with the word “homosexual” prominently used in its ads. Positioned as a niche film, “Fox” caused controversy. Some critics and activists took offense at Fassbinder’s depiction of gay life or, more precisely, his use of a gay milieu to make fresh a familiar story of sexual exploitation. Discussing “Fox” before it went into production, Fassbinder made no mention of his main characters’ sexual orientation, blandly describing it as the story of “a young entrepreneur whose company is on the verge of bankruptcy, and who manages to trick money out of someone to save the firm.” When “Fox” had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, he maintained that “homosexuality is shown as completely normal,” adding that the “problem” is social inequality and it’s “something quite different.” Hollywood movies like “The Killing of Sister George” or “The Boys in the Band,” are told from an outsider’s perspective. “Fox” is not. Fassbinder’s on-camera presence in virtually every scene gives the film a confessional aspect. Still, if “Fox” is a psychodrama, Fassbinder is playing a role. That he did not see himself as the character Fox may be gleaned from the movie’s dedication to his real-life lover, Armin Meier, and “the others.” A few years later, Fassbinder and Meier, who soon after committed suicide, played themselves, as bully and abject partner, in Fassbinder’s contribution to the 1978 anthology film “Germany in Autumn.” Fassbinder gave himself cameos in a number of films including his superbly insolent second feature, “Katzelmacher” (1969). Here, as in “Fox,” he appears as an underclass pariah — a sullen Greek immigrant worker in Munich. The director also starred in other people’s films. Trim and 25, he plays a loutish, charismatic poet in Volker Schlöndorff’s TV adaptation of Brecht’s expressionist play “Baal”; scarcely a dozen years later, squeezed into an incongruous leopard skin suit, the mature, paunchy Fassbinder starred as a police detective in Wolf Gremm’s punk science-fiction satire, “Kamikaze ’89.” The film was released shortly after his death, at age 36, apparently of a drug overdose. Reviewing “Kamikaze” in 1983, Canby wrote that its focal point was “Fassbinder’s easy, neo-Wellesian control of every scene in which he appears — a control that has as much to do with wisdom as with weight.” “Fox and His Friends,” “Katzelmacher” and “Baal” are all available for streaming from the Criterion Channel; “Kamikaze ’89” streams from Film Movement Plus.",The New York Times
2019,‘Frightening’: Charges Against Julian Assange Alarm Press Advocates,"Journalists and press freedom groups reacted with alarm on Thursday after the Trump administration announced new charges against Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks leader, for publishing classified information, in a case that legal experts say takes direct aim at previously sacrosanct protections for the news media. In indicting Mr. Assange for obtaining, accepting and disseminating classified materials, the Department of Justice opened a new front in its campaign against illegal leaks. While past cases involved government employees who provided material to journalists, the Assange indictment could amount to the pursuit of a publisher for making that material available to the public. “It’s not criminal to encourage someone to leak classified information to you as a journalist — that’s called news gathering, and there are First Amendment protections for news gathering,” said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer who frequently represents media organizations like CNN. “The ramifications of this are so potentially dangerous and serious for the ability of journalists to gather and disseminate information that the American people have a right to know.” Federal prosecutors under President Trump have drawn criticism for extending a crackdown on leakers that had ramped up during President Barack Obama’s administration. The indictment of Mr. Assange — which related to WikiLeaks’ publication of secret documents leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst — struck some experts as a grave escalation. “It is one thing to charge a government official who has sworn an oath not to disclose classified information,” said Matthew Miller, who served as the Justice Department’s chief spokesman under Mr. Obama’s attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. “It’s another thing to charge someone outside the government who published information or solicited information, which is something that reporters do all the time.” The charges against Mr. Assange are likely to face a challenge on First Amendment grounds. And journalists’ use of illegally obtained materials has been upheld in Supreme Court cases. But Mr. Miller said prosecutors had now skated to the edge of criminalizing journalistic practices. “The Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and nonjournalists,” Mr. Miller said, referring to the law that Mr. Assange is accused of violating. “If you can charge Julian Assange under the law with publishing classified information, there is nothing under the law that prevents the Justice Department from charging a journalist.” A deeply divisive figure, Mr. Assange is in some ways an unlikely martyr for press freedoms. A crusader for radical transparency, he is faulted by many American liberals for releasing hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee at the height of the 2016 presidential race. “The calculation by the Department of Justice is that here’s someone who people don’t like,” Mr. Boutrous said. “There’s a real element of picking the weakest of the herd, or the most unpopular figure, to try to blunt the outcry.” Justice Department officials on Thursday cited Mr. Assange’s mixed reputation as they tried to reject the notion that they were interfering with the free press. “The department takes seriously the role of journalists in our democracy, and we thank you for it,” John Demers, the head of the department’s National Security Division, said at a briefing with reporters. “It is not, and has never been, the department’s policy to target them for reporting.” “Julian Assange is no journalist,” Mr. Demers added. Still, press advocates were quick to condemn the Justice Department on Thursday. The American Civil Liberties Union called the indictment “a direct assault on the First Amendment.” The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press described it as “a dire threat.” Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, said in a statement: “Obtaining and publishing information that the government would prefer to keep secret is vital to journalism and democracy. The new indictment is a deeply troubling step toward giving the government greater control over what Americans are allowed to know.” Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard lawyer who has been a recent ally of Mr. Trump, said the case against Mr. Assange was “really the first time since the Pentagon Papers that the government has gone after publishers.” “We all think there’s a difference between The New York Times and Assange from a practical point of view, but from a constitutional point of view, it’s hard to find that difference,” Mr. Dershowitz said. “They’re both publishing classified, stolen material.” “This is analogous to if The New York Times and The Washington Post had been prosecuted after publishing the Pentagon Papers,” Mr. Dershowitz added, referring to the top-secret report on Vietnam whose publication in 1971 was upheld by the Supreme Court. “It’s a very, very frightening development.” But Asha Rangappa, a lawyer and former F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, said she believed that the Justice Department had made a crucial distinction between Mr. Assange’s activity and the work of traditional journalists. “He wasn’t simply a passive recipient of classified information; he actively participated in the breaking of the law,” Ms. Rangappa said. She added that Mr. Assange’s efforts to help his source, Ms. Manning, illegally obtain documents amounted to “aiding and abetting the criminal act itself.” “That is a meaningful distinction from a bona fide news organization that truly has a public interest goal,” Ms. Rangappa said. Seymour Hersh, the investigative journalist who exposed the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War and misconduct by the C.I.A., among other revelations, wrote in an email that the move against Mr. Assange was troubling. “Today Assange,” Mr. Hersh wrote. “Tomorrow, perhaps, The New York Times and other media that published so much of the important news and information Assange provided.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Game of Thrones,’ Season 8, Episode 4: Dracarys","Game of Thrones There were plenty of broken hearts to go around Sunday on “Game of Thrones.” There was Brienne, who realized her longstanding dream of bedding the Kingslayer, only to have all her feelings slain soon after. Gendry, buoyed by his new nobility, showed how little he knows Arya by asking her to be his lady, and received the predictable reply. “That’s not me,” she said, this season’s latest callback to the earliest chapters of this story. (Seriously, Gendry? You think she saved the human race last week so she could host parties at Storm’s End?) [Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.” | Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] Then there was Grey Worm, who saw his beloved Missandei lose her head in one of the show’s crueler executions. I knew the Naath love nest they dreamed about a couple weeks ago would never come to pass, but figured (hoped?) it would be Grey Worm’s end that prevented it. But it was the other primary witness to Missandei’s death whose broken heart will have the most world-shattering repercussions. That would be Daenerys, who lost not only her most trusted confidante this week but also her dragon Rhaegal, who had survived having his wing tattered in the White Walker battle only to get shot out of the sky, thanks to the Euron fleet’s exceptional marksmanship. (I guess while we’ve been in Winterfell for the past two weeks, they’ve been taking target practice on the Scorpion range.) It was a bad week for the Dragon Queen, the latest in a fairly regular string of tragedy and indignity that began roughly when she started hanging out with Jon and doesn’t suggest much in the way of a happy ending. Sunday’s episode opened where we ended last week, with Dany weeping over a dead Jorah, her second most trusted confidante. The Long Night over, the sun had risen — insert your own “Battle of Winterfell darkness” joke here — and the survivors paid flaming tribute to “the shields that guard the realms of men,” as Jon described the fallen heroes, in one of his better bits of oratory. It was time for the healing to begin, and also the refocusing, as the show pivoted from the White Walker clash we’ve been hearing about for awhile to the final one in King’s Landing. Soon there would be battle strategizing that somehow involved a glorified Risk board but not the guy — or whatever Bran is — who can warg into U-2 spy ravens. Soon this heroic band of brothers and sisters would scatter, Dany would find new torment and Tyrion would make more faulty plans. But first it was time to turn Winterfell into a party house from some ’80s teen comedy. Tormund sloshed wine everywhere except his actual mouth. Tyrion and Jaime played drinking games with Brienne and Podrick. (Another Season 1 callback.) Attractive young women fawned over schlubs. (Apparently Tormund and the Hound are irresistible to nubile young Northerners.) Everything — and everyone — got trashed. And, of course, it all ended with someone losing their virginity. There’s a certain segment of “Thrones” fans who wanted Brienne to pair off with Jaime, but I was not among them. I understand the heightened sex quotient of recent weeks — when you’re squaring off with death, a desire to embrace life seems natural. And Lord of Light knows, Brienne deserves some fun. But there’s something clichéd and regressive about this apparent need to bend every male-female onscreen relationship toward romance. Brienne and Jaime’s bond was endearing because it seemed to be based more on mutual admiration, a riff on the way some people can urge you toward your better self. Throwing sex into the mix doesn’t necessarily cheapen everything that’s come before, but it does make it less interesting. It seems to be over, at any rate, which was awkward for other reasons. Jaime had barely begun embracing his better self and Tyrion’s tall jokes before word of Cersei turned him into a sort of one-handed Manchurian Candidate heading back for King’s Landing. “She’s hateful, and so am I,” he told a sobbing Brienne. I know the show needs him to have a final showdown with his partner in twincest, but it felt pretty abrupt. Also abrupt: Sansa’s spilling of Jon’s secrets. Mere hours after swearing her secrecy and all the rhetoric about “the last of the Starks” sticking together, she was blabbing the most explosive revelation in the Known World to Tyrion, the person closest to the subject of said revelation. Sansa, no fan of Dany’s, presumably had her reasons. But at least one of those seemed to be “because the show needed the word to get out” — a development that, like Jaime’s departure, distracted by seeming to result more from narrative necessity than a character’s natural behavior. Whatever its origin, it’s yet another complicating factor for Daenerys in a season filled with same. You’ll recall how utterly indestructible Team Daenerys looked as it crossed the Narrow Sea at the end of Season 6. The occasional Loot Train Attack aside, much of the show since then has been about evening the odds between her and Cersei’s forces, with Dany losing Viserion, Greyjoy ships (at least twice now) and a bunch of Dothraki and Unsullied while Cersei gained Euron’s armada and about 20,000 Golden Company mercenaries. “The balance has grown distressingly even,” Varys noted Sunday, and that was before Rhaegal went down. (Imagine where things would stand now if Cersei’s elephants had come through.) This season there’s been a parallel effort to strip Daenerys down emotionally and back her in a corner, making her paradoxically more likely to go off even as she continues to lose firepower. Sansa has openly resented her, even after Dany paused her own aspirations in order to join the White Walker fight. Jon has a better claim on the Iron Throne than she does, and people like him better, too. She began this week mourning Jorah and ended it watching Missandei get decapitated. Along the way her boyfriend denied her pleas, her dragonbaby died, and her Hand hatched yet another plan — ask Cersei to surrender — that blew up in her face. Daenerys’s messianic qualities and single-minded throne lust have always made her a dicey candidate for realm-ruling. “I have served tyrants most of my life — they all talk about destiny,” Varys said, and he’s not wrong. But in Dany’s defense, how much more is the woman supposed to take? She seems done listening to anything aside from her own sense of justice. And if that means tens of thousands of King’s Landing innocents have the sky fall down upon them, so be it. The question is whether she’ll end up falling along with it. • Cersei is going to keep using this pregnancy gimmick until it stops working. But is that day coming soon? If you’re Euron, you’d probably wonder how Tyrion could know about Cersei’s impending arrival if he’s been away all this time. • Bronn finally showed up with the crossbow and his counteroffer, and left with yet another Lannister I.O.U.: Highgarden. (Castles were being doled out all over Winterfell.) Maybe Jaime can catch up with him on the way back to King’s Landing. [A Starbucks in Winterfell? Somehow, a modern disposable coffee cup appeared in Sunday’s episode.] • Also headed to King’s Landing: Jon, Grey Worm and their remaining army, and Arya and the Hound. By reuniting perhaps the best road duo of the show and portending a Cleganebowl (“some unfinished business”), it’s a two-for-one fan service deal, but I’m O.K. with it. • I alluded to it earlier, but Team Dany isn’t really into reconnaissance or military intelligence, huh? They might want to reconsider this strategy (or lack thereof) before they lose all their dragons. • “Dracarys!” Missandei said with her final breaths, a stirring call to arms that, in the context, translates essentially into “Burn them all!” Now where have I heard that before … • So was that the last time we saw Ghost, Tormund, Sam and Gilly? Gilly mocked Sam for trying to explain to Jon where babies come from, but I think in his own clumsy way, Sam was trying to brag. • And allow me to be the four millionth person to wonder how a man can fail to even pet the wolf he’ll never see again, especially one that apparently lost an ear fighting its owner’s battles. • “She’s his aunt,” Varys said. Thank you, Varys. Somebody had to say it. • So what do you think? Will Dany blow it all up next week? Is Jaime returning to join Cersei? Or kill her? What’s your favorite ’80s teen party movie? (I’m partial to “Weird Science” but none of them have aged very well.) Please fire away in the comments. (Dracarys!)",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Comes in for a Crash Landing,"Critic’s notebook The finale fell short of the series’s heights, but delivered some reminders of the spectacular ride it had been. In the end, the dragons were just too big to control. When “Game of Thrones” began eight years ago, there were no dragons. It started as a more intimate story of family and politics, and Daenerys Targaryen’s cat-sized fire babies didn’t hatch until the end of the first season. They got bigger and bigger, and stronger and stronger, and with them grew the series’s reliance on spectacle and stunning set pieces. (As did the production scale; next to the show’s final battles, Daenerys’s conquest of Astapor, jaw-dropping back in Season 3, looks like a pickup soccer match.) So it was fitting, if not entirely satisfying, that the climactic act and the tenderest emotional moment in the series finale, “The Iron Throne,” belonged not to any human but to Drogon, Daenerys’s last surviving lizard-child. After eight seasons of carnage over the throne, it was Drogon — First of Its Name, Flame-Broiler of Cities — who came upon Daenerys, dead at the hand of her soldier/lover/nephew/betrayer Jon Snow, reared back, belched fire and smelted the seat of power into a puddle of lava. [HBO went to great lengths to keep the finale secret until it aired, professional bettors saw clear signs that key details had leaked and were trying to cash in.] It was the perfect climax for the show that “Game of Thrones” finally became. Its key scene belonged to a massive CGI animation whose motivations we will never fathom. The image echoed the climax of “The Lord of the Rings,” in which Gollum, reunited with his precious ring, tottered and fell into the magma of Mount Doom. But Gollum, though monstrous, was a person. We knew his reasons: His twisted covetousness gave him an inadvertent, pivotal role in the grand drama. [Looking for something to watch now that “Game of Thrones” is over? Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] Why, on the other hand, did Drogon do it? Grief? Animal instinct? A political epiphany that the hereditary monarchy must be smashed in favor of a system that involves consent of the governed? We’ll never know. It just looked cool. And as Drogon tenderly scooped Daenerys’s body into a claw and flew off into the gray sky, it was honestly more moving than the final interaction of the two humans in the scene. This was the endgame of “Thrones” in miniature: Stunning on the outside, affecting in small moments, inscrutable at heart. How well “Game of Thrones” ended depends largely on how well you think it pulled off the key turn of last week’s “The Bells,” in which Daenerys, having won the surrender of King’s Landing, presses her attack and incinerates the defenseless townspeople. After a week, and especially after the finale, I’ve decided it was a botch. Leaving aside whether the attack “should” have happened, it failed the basic job of a story, to give us a clear sense of what the central figure did and why. Is Daenerys insane? Did she have a rationale for targeting the defenseless that she never spelled out? Or were the citizens simply collateral damage in an overzealous drive to eradicate Queen Cersei’s troops? [Read our recap of the series finale.] I’m still not sure, and after the finale, I’m not convinced the makers of the show are sure either. In a Nuremberg-like speech to her victorious troops — which opened with the breathtaking image of Drogon’s wings behind an imperious Emilia Clarke, as if unfolding from her own shoulder blades — Dany spoke of having “liberated” the people of King’s Landing, who, to all appearances, were mostly dead. Maybe she’d gone mad (an interpretation suggested in the attack, which she began with an expression so twisted that the bells may as well have been playing “The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down”). Or maybe most of the populace actually survived, like the Dothraki, whose encounter with the army of the dead at the Battle of Winterfell turned out to be a flesh wound. We could only guess, clued partly by a dialogue between Jon and Tyrion Lannister (the opening figure and moral heart of the episode) that felt like a meta recap of fans’ defenses of “The Bells” online. Daenerys, Tyrion argued, had a history of cruelty. “Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer for it,” he said. “And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right.” Who created this monster? Dear viewer, it was us. On paper, honestly, it almost makes sense. The problem is that a TV series doesn’t unfold on paper. The endgame had a great idea to work with: A woman, abused and traded like chattel, becomes so caught up in her zeal to do good that she sees anything but blind adoration as evil. But it never took us inside her perspective to make that change seem real and inevitable. “Game of Thrones” instead relied on propulsion, like Wile E. Coyote running off a cliff. If things feel right enough in the moment, momentum carries you to the next thing. Look down, and you plummet. Maybe that’s the secret of dragon flight. Once Drogon disappeared, it felt like “Game of Thrones” proper had ended, replaced, for the finale’s remaining half, by a smaller, thinner show concerned with checking off boxes, delivering farewells, comic relief and final answers. The biggest one — who should rule? — was settled in a gathering of lords that played as if the writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were workshopping acceptable compromise outcomes. (Samwell Tarly went so far as to propose a direct democracy, a popular fan theory, and was hooted down.) Finally, Tyrion nominated Bran Stark, the psychic Lorax who communes with the trees, with the elevator pitch that he had the most powerful “story.” It was the most Hollywood of solutions: The best forum for deciding how to govern a country, it suggested, was a writers’ room. (“There’s nothing in the world more powerful than a good story” is a beautiful sentiment, and one no character in a story should ever utter.) Thus the three-headed dragon gave way to the three-eyed raven. I’ll let you argue about who “deserved” the crown, a position that did not end happily for the last [counts on fingers] half-dozen or so incumbents. But the resolution felt optimistic in a way that was justified by exactly zero of “Game of Thrones” to date. What in the series’s history or view of human nature suggests that this won’t end in a seven-way civil war inside a few years? Everyone’s suddenly cool with an extra monarchy for Sansa and no one else? Will every would-be Littlefinger stop his or her scheming, pacified by the new administration’s infrastructure plans? If my issue with “The Bells” was that it got the macro picture right and the micro wrong — it was clear why the show would burn King’s Landing, just not why Daenerys would — “The Iron Throne” was the opposite. It was the small character moments that worked best here. There was Tyrion, in the silence before the final Small Council meeting, anxiously straightening the chairs around the table. (This was very much Peter Dinklage’s episode, and as much exposition as he had to deliver, he sold Tyrion as a man desperate to redeem his mistakes.) There was Arya, permanently changed by a life of assassination and survival, sailing west of Westeros, a poignant, hopeful image that mirrored her setting off for Braavos at the end of Season 4. And as much as it made no practical sense that there’s still a Night’s Watch — are they guarding against the suddenly vanished Dothraki? — Jon rejoining the Wildlings, the outcasts among whom he once found a home, made emotional sense. As a finale, “The Iron Throne” was limited by the story arc that led up to it.

2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Director on Ghost’s Departure and Brienne’s Collapse,"This article contains spoilers for the first four episodes of Season 8 of “Game of Thrones.” Barack Obama once teasingly told the director David Nutter that he had killed off all of his favorite characters on “Game of Thrones.” No wonder, since this is the man who oversaw the slaughter of the Starks at the Red Wedding, the burning of Shireen and the Night’s Watch’s murder of Jon Snow. Nutter’s installments during the final season of “Game of Thrones” — Episodes 1, 2 and 4 — have been a little less violent, focusing on classic character reunions and goodbyes. During a phone interview on Monday, Nutter shared what insights he gave the actors to help make these moments so special. Following are edited excerpts. [Read our recap of Season 8, Episode 4.] So a lot of fans were upset that Ghost didn’t get so much as a goodbye pet. I’m guessing that was a CGI issue … Very much so. It’s all about how to balance that all out, and making sure it’s done properly, and reminding you of the characters and what’s at stake and what’s happening at any particular moment. Jon saying goodbye to the direwolf was so very powerful and rich because of the actors. They’ve spent many years doing this, and it’s the culmination of their characters in some respects, so it’s manipulating how much you want to give them. All that kind of stuff, we play with. It’s about finding the best idea and being able to rally around whatever that idea is. “Game of Thrones” actors have said you bring out something unexpected from their performance by giving them a fresh insight or a new take. Can you share any of the notes you gave actors over the years that shaped their overall performance? Sure! When I first started on the show, Rory McCann, who plays the Hound, was someone who had a lot of promise. He was fantastic, but he had some issues with his performance. He hadn’t done a whole lot of acting. So I basically sat down with him, sat down across the table from him, and we read through a couple of sequences together. Ten minutes later, I looked at him and I said, “O.K., here’s the deal. Stop acting. Just say the words like Clint Eastwood would say them.” Once he started to do that, at that point, it was basically all done. Sometimes, when actors reach out to their characters, they’re nowhere in sight. They need to find something inside of them. And then the characters are right there. As a director, I want them to find the character that’s already inside them, instead of trying to manufacture or manipulate or make something up. That’s not really honest or true. What about something from Season 8? One thing I did this season was tell Sophie Turner about how Sansa should interact with Dany. There was a bit of trepidation about it, because they have a big scene where they meet in Episode 1, but they’re also facing off as well. I had to remind Sophie to think of Winterfell as Sansa’s house: This is her house that Dany’s coming into. I wanted to give her all the confidence in the world, so she could give back as well as she got, and not be intimidated in any way. I think she did a really tremendous job of doing that. There may be a sequence where one person sees another person, and I’ll have the actor say something that’s not scripted that might be more akin to the emotional state the character is in. That can sometimes surprise the other actor. What’s an example of that? One I thought worked very well was in Sunday’s episode. I told Nikolaj [Coster-Waldau] that when Jaime is telling Brienne about how everything he’s done, he’s done for Cersei. And as he was saying his lines, we went into Brienne’s close-up, Gwendoline Christie’s close-up, and there was a moment where she is just watching him, at the very end. And I walked over to Nikolaj and I said, “The last thing I want you to tell her is that you don’t love her anymore.” And of course, he was essentially saying this to her anyway, in some respect, but she didn’t expect to hear it directly. Gwendoline didn’t expect that moment, and she just lost it. It was something very special. Sometimes surprising an actor in a good way like that can actually create a response you’re not expecting. And with those two, they’re very close as well, so I knew something like that would affect her character as well. What about the final moments between Tyrion and Cersei, when he’s trying to appeal to her better nature? I think there’s a moment where Tyrion is trying to touch Cersei’s sense of being a mother, her real love for her family and her children. That really affects her, in a very strong way. There was a sequence we shot with Lena Headey and Pilou Asbaek where he basically leaves her alone in the room, and all I said to Lena was, “He leaves you, and we’re just going to hang on to you for a long time, and I want you to have a chance to, in a sense, validate what you just did, and be disgusted by what you just did.” And it was a shot used in one of the trailers from the episode. It was one of the longest shots in the sequence, where you saw the door close, and you saw her go through this range of emotions in about three seconds, which I thought was quite exceptionally powerful and really special. That’s when Euron Greyjoy discovers Cersei’s pregnant with what he presumes is his child. There is a very subtle moment when Tyrion is talking to Cersei and he mentions that pregnancy, and Euron gives Cersei a look like, “How on earth would he know about this?” Right! The acting is so incredible that the thing about directing is really just to give them the space to do their thing, and create a setting where they can use their own natural instincts. And also so very much of what I do as a director is handled by the amazing editing on the show. They’re master magicians at knowing where exactly to hit the note, and how to play it beautifully. Emilia Clarke’s reactions in this episode run the gamut, especially as you help set the stage for Dany’s Mad Queen vibes. There’s really the sense that her character is getting a sense of isolation. Realizing that Jorah Mormont is no longer there. That moment of overhearing Tormund talking about how Jon is a king because he jumped on a dragon and fought with a dragon, when she’s done that multiple times and she’s not being recognized for it. I think it’s an interesting reference point for her character to deal with. And also seeing Jon after the feast, there’s really a situation where we see how that affected her, and her desperation to make Jon listen to her, and to not be such an angel. I think by the end of that sequence, she has a real sense of determination that is so important and powerful, but also one note, so that when we see Varys and Tyrion in the map room, and they’re begging her to not really do what she’s doing, she has an almost calm, cool, collected quality about her: “This is the decision I’ve made. This is how it’s going to be. This is my calling.” And I thought that was a much scarier way of protesting, rather than getting hysterical or anything like that. I also wanted to save that ability that Emilia has, to use her face to morph into different shapes and phases, for the end of the episode, to reflect how her character feels. There is an anger that comes out of Emilia, out of Dany’s character, at the end of this episode that I’ve never seen out of Dany before. I’m actually quite scared about what she’s going to do next!",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Fans Gripe About the Finale’s Pointy End (and a Water Bottle),"“Game of Thrones” is finally complete. And for many fans, that’s the best that can be said about its final season. Expectations for Sunday’s finale, “The Iron Throne,” were simultaneously sky high and terribly low — fans have been largely let down by this season’s offerings, but many held out hope that the final installment would bring a satisfying resolution to the various loose ends. Based on the immediate reaction on social media and by professional critics, the episode offered moments of fan service — Ghost! — but did little to wipe away the problems that have plagued the final season. (It also offered one last apparent continuity error to get raven-eyed watchers riled up, a blink-and-you-miss-it moment you probably didn’t catch on first watch.) [Read our recap of the series finale.] For years, guessing who would sit on the Iron Throne — or, at least, who would lead the Seven Kingdoms — at the end of the series has been among the central questions of the show. So to end up with Bran, who was more memorable for his blank stare than for his one-liner dialogue and was disposable enough to sit out an entire season at one point, registered to some as anticlimactic. There were arguments to be made for the youngest living Stark: He lacks ego and doesn’t appear to crave power for power’s sake, plus his skills as the Three Eyed Raven seem pretty useful for governance. Still. Bran? In our recap, Jeremy Egner called him “one of the most unsatisfying characters on the show.” At the dragon pit meeting, quite a few fans were expecting the ascent of Sansa Stark, whose resilience and growth over the course of the show, paired with her experience running Winterfell, made her arguably the most qualified candidate to rule the realm. Nope. The committee chose the man next to her. The author Roxane Gay noted on Twitter that the show’s creators could “imagine dragons but they can’t imagine a sane, smart woman as ruler of the six or seven kingdoms.” Some fans saw Sansa’s snubbing as emblematic of the show’s treatment of women, which came under deeper scrutiny after its use of sexual violence in earlier seasons. The small council in King’s Landing was attended by all men except for Brienne of Tarth, whose only other contribution in the finale was recording the history of her male ex-lover, Jaime Lannister. Sansa got a triumphant final shot as Queen of the North, but to some fans, she and the show’s other female characters deserved more. “‘Game of Thrones’ was initially built on a premise of subverting established high fantasy tropes, and surely one of the most innate fantasy tropes of all involves the idea that only men are fit to rule,” Aja Romano wrote at Vox. “After a final season that saw two powerful queens reduced, respectively, to going mad and dying whimpering in a cave collapse, the show’s choice to place the future stability of Westeros on a bunch of male shoulders feels deeply regressive and thoughtless.” [Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.” | Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] Did the final season move too fast? Did the characters’ decisions feel vaguely understandable, but unearned by what you saw on screen? If you feel that way, you’re far from alone. While the first six seasons had 10 episodes apiece, the show’s creators, D.B. Weiss and David Benioff, decided to shorten the final two seasons to seven and six episodes, respectively. Writing at The Washington Post, Alyssa Rosenberg said the decision was “a choice that may go down as one of the worst in recent television history.” Her criticism mirrored a common theme among initial reactions: It wasn’t necessarily the plot turns that were the problem. Rushing toward an ending without fully developing the characters’ motivations was the problem. “Plenty of developments in ‘The Iron Throne’ landed,” Alison Herman wrote at The Ringer. “They just could have landed much deeper if they’d been preceded by a more meticulous set-up.” [Here are 9 things we still want to know after the ‘Game of Thrones’ ending.] Two weeks ago, fans noticed that a modern coffee cup had inadvertently made it onto a table in Winterfell. In the series finale, a plastic water bottle apparently traveled through the same time machine, appearing next to Samwell Tarly’s chair while the leaders of Westeros debated their future. • After the season’s fourth episode, fans were incensed that Jon Snow left Winterfell without petting Ghost. In perhaps the finale’s most satisfying scene, Ghost finally got a scratch behind the ear. Fans were elated. • For a creature that just indiscriminately slaughtered many thousands of people, Drogon was remarkably restrained upon discovering Daenerys had been slain. “This is quite possibly the smartest dragon in the world, as it inherently understood that it was the corrupting power of the Iron Throne that led to Dany’s downfall, and not Jon Snow,” Nate Scott wrote at For the Win. “Or it’s the stupidest dragon in the world, as it saw a knife in Dany and assumed it was the evil chair made of knives who stabbed her, and then had its revenge.” • One source of widespread agreement: Puberty treated Robin Arryn well, as seen by his brief appearance at the dragon pit. • One unresolved plot hole: Did Brienne make a mess when she closed the book without letting the ink dry? • Is Arya on the same narrative path as Christopher Columbus? • Samwell Tarly seemed to be on his way to inventing representative democracy, until all of the most powerful people in Westeros laughed in his face. It was one of the episode’s few moments of levity.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Fans: We’ve Got Some Books for You,"Newsbook The “Game of Thrones” finale, which aired on Sunday, marks the end of a Twitter era. For those already feeling nostalgic, consider reading the books that the HBO show is based on — or plunge into a new epic world with one of these seven other series. Jemisin “burst on the epic fantasy scene with her earlier Inheritance trilogy,” our reviewer wrote about the last installment in this series, “and has pretty well conquered it with Broken Earth.” She won the Hugo Award for best novel for each of the books. Start with “The Fifth Season,” which begins at the end of the world and follows a woman as she tries to recover her kidnapped daughter. There are nine novels in this time-bending series about Jamie Fraser, an 18th-century Scotsman, and Claire Randall, a World War II-era nurse, whose worlds collide when Claire is transported back in time. The Outlander series — which starts with a namesake title, “Outlander” — was made into a television show on Starz. The six historical romance novels that make up this series are “vivid, engaging, densely potted,” one critic wrote in 2000 (sound familiar?). The books follow Francis Crawford of Lymond, “the perfect romantic hero,” and its events unfold during the 11 years from the Scottish border wars of 1547 to the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1558. Set in the fictional archipelago of Earthsea, this series follows a child named Ged through his journey to become a wizard. LeGuin has an “intricate imagination,” our reviewer wrote, adding that in the first book, “A Wizard of Earthsea,” the “attention to physical detail effectively and exactly” represents “young Ged’s reactions to the strange world about him.” This series, which starts with “Perdido Street Station,” is set in the fictional world of Bas-Lag, in a complex city, New Crobuzon, inhabited by a broad range of human and nonhuman characters. In a review on the website Tor, one critic recommended several readings: “The first time, you read it as a travelogue of New Crobuzon,” she wrote, as Miéville dips in and out of multiple perspectives. After, “you reread it for the pleasurable intricacy of Bas-Lag’s cultural and economic substructures and to appreciate the inventive strangeness of the social details — languages, clothing, cultural artifacts and the like — that you zipped past the first time.” These nine novels reimagine the events of the Napoleonic Wars. The story starts when, while serving in the British Navy, Capt. Will Laurence finds a dragon egg in a captured French warship. He becomes the dragon’s master, and his discovery will alter the course of history. In a review in The Washington Post, one writer called the first book, “Her Majesty’s Dragon,” the “most original of dragon books” and wrote that it contains a “generous dollop of intelligent derring-do.” These seven historical novels follow the Iron King, Philip the Fair, as he attempts to rule his kingdom and his family. “Believe me, the Starks and Lannisters have nothing on the Capets and Plantagenets,” George R. R. Martin himself wrote about the series in The Guardian. “It is the original game of thrones.” Or you could just dive right back into Westeros and read “A Game of Thrones,” the first in Martin’s yet uncompleted series about the epic fight for the Iron Throne. In an interview with The Times from 2005, Martin described how he conceived of the series: One day, an image came to him of a man who was taking a boy to witness a beheading. They find a dead direwolf who has just given birth to a litter and decide to rescue them. This became the opening scene in “A Game of Thrones.” “To this day I don’t know where it came from,” Martin said. “But I knew that I had to write it.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Is Going Out Fighting. So Will Its Audience.,"Critic’s notebook The arguments over HBO’s dark fantasy made it the signature show of an era when no one agrees on anything. Who will win the Iron Throne? Who should win the Iron Throne? Should there even be an Iron Throne? The plot of “Game of Thrones” will be settled Sunday night. The arguments, if history is a guide, will never be. HBO’s swords-and-dragons fantasy drama, about a multifactional battle among royal houses to rule the mythical continent of Westeros, appealed to audiences’ guts and brains. It was the sort of breathtaking production once reserved for summer movie blockbusters. It weaved a vast, obsessive mythology. It was part family drama, part lurid potboiler and part complex psychological study — topped off with secret-parentage twists and an encroaching zombie army. It became a sensation domestically (18.4 million viewers last Sunday, not counting later streaming, DVR recordings or piracy) and internationally. It was a windfall for HBO to rival the gold mines of House Lannister, and it regularly lit up the internet like dragonfire. Most of all, it was a mass-market hit for the era of no social consensus. What made “Game of Thrones” emblematic of its time is how it divided its audience from start to finish, right down to the matter of what a happy ending would even constitute. It gave its intense fandom multiple angles to debate as well as to enjoy: whether it kept faith with the popular novels it was based on; whether it reveled in brutality in the name of critiquing it; whether it well-served its female characters or exploited them; and whether it lost control of its story as it sprinted to the finish. Half a century ago, viewers of “The Fugitive” collectively wanted Richard Kimble to catch the One-Armed Man. But what does anyone want from the end of “Game of Thrones”? Maybe you want to see Sansa Stark break the dragon-glass ceiling, completing her journey from fairytale-besotted naïf to commanding queen. Maybe you want to see Jon Snow rewarded for years of self-sacrifice and impeccably moisturized hair. Maybe you think Daenerys Targaryen was done dirty. (You incinerate one city and suddenly you’re the villain!) Maybe you want the Iron Bank of Braavos to repossess the entire dysfunctional realm, liquidate its assets and call for internationally monitored elections. The disputes over “Game of Thrones” often served as proxies for arguments in the mundane real world. They were about how power is best won and wielded; about the portrayal of women and attitudes toward violence; about whose stories are subordinated to someone else’s hero journey; about whether ethics in leadership is a requirement, an impediment or a luxury. There was a certain amount of dissonance built in to a saga that combined the HBO sensibility — dark psychological realism and realpolitik moral ambiguity — to epic high fantasy: a genre in which, once upon a time, the only shades of gray were in the wizards’ cloaks. The most popular fantasy epics tend to focus on a quest the audience agrees on. The Ring must be destroyed, Voldemort must be defeated, Aslan must prevail. Pure-hearted underdogs triumph; kind and wise leaders restore order. These stories model, and affirm, values we’re assumed to share. J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, published in the 1950s, was about a collective battle against an evil so unambiguous that it’s been misinterpreted as an allegory for World War II; the first installment in Peter Jackson’s film adaptation appeared in 2001, in the collective aftershock of Sept. 11. “Game of Thrones” began in 2011, entering a TV culture complicated by “The Sopranos” and a society that had seen authority discredited in Iraq and on Wall Street. It aired internationally, in places whose national mythologies didn’t necessarily mesh with America’s to begin with. And it landed in the era of social media, a global watercooler made for instant reaction, side-choosing and second-guessing. From the start, “Game of Thrones” put moral certainties to the sword. It spoke, if not always consistently, to a time of less agreement about either means or ends. Characters’ best intentions were often thwarted and cynicism rewarded. The series spent seasons on a queen’s disastrous attempt to impose benevolent rule on a foreign land. Sadistic kings made bad rulers, it said, but so did doormats. It was not easy to know whom to like or what to hope for. The night was dark and the path obscure. Many controversies around the show, adapted from a yet-unfinished series of novels by George R.R. Martin, came from its own choices and missteps. The producers flattened out some nuances, relied on cultural exoticism and loaded episodes with gratuitous sex and rape scenes — some of which they seemed unaware even were rape scenes. (After Sansa’s brutal rape in 2015, Claire McCaskill, then a senator, tweeted, “I’m done.”) In the later seasons, the show rushed and emphasized visual spectacles over character development. Last Sunday, when Daenerys, portrayed through most of the series as a flawed heroine, razed a city of helpless civilians on dragonback, a character turn that might have been set up organically instead came divebombing out of the sun for shock value. Arguments — even a petition to remake the season — ensued. But some disagreement was also intrinsic to the show. It was maybe part of the point. It was certainly part of the fun. What made “Thrones” tough to wrestle with also made it a ubiquitous metaphor. That’s what great pop fiction does: adds characters to the shared cultural mythology that we use to tell stories to ourselves, about ourselves. Was “Thrones,” with its spectral White Walkers, heralded by extreme weather and threatening to end all life, a parable of climate change? No. But it was a story of collective-action problems — it was in everyone’s interest to work together but in individuals’ interests to let someone else sacrifice — and that skeleton key fits any number of contemporary woes, climate included. Was it a political roman à clef? No, despite eight years of hacky “Candidates as ‘Thrones’ Characters” gags. But it was cannily political, attuned to the value of alliances and flexibility. And its makers seemed attuned to the real-world readings of the show, writing a dialogue in which advisers anticipating objections to elevating a callow man (Jon) over an experienced woman (Daenerys), as if they were discussing his electability in the Upper Great Lakes. And the show’s ideas were conscripted to wildly different ends. President Trump swiped the show’s typography to make swaggering meme images that perverted its themes (among them, the folly of demonizing the humans on the other side of a wall). Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote a column praising Daenerys that she might want a do-over on. Of course, it’s not as if we weren’t warned not to idolize anyone here. “Game of Thrones” began, with the execution of the seeming hero Ned Stark, by telling us that a good heart gets you only so far in this world. It returned toward the end, with the obliteration of King’s Landing, to the idea that missions of liberation can become messianic massacres. It made us confront a victory that we’d rooted for, over the conniving and greedy Lannister dynasty, by giving it to us as a war crime. It told us that constructing a just society for the living can be more difficult than defeating an army of the dead. It took the easy part out of the way first — the Tolkienesque quest we could all agree on — and focused us on the trickier problem of what comes after. You can dispel every evil spirit and slay every dragon. In the end, we still have each other to worry about.",The New York Times

2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8 Finale Recap: All Hail King Who?,"Game of Thrones In the end, “Game of Thrones” was about blowing up the game of thrones. At times Sunday’s series finale rendered this literally, as when the Iron Throne itself, the inspiration for most of the terrible things we’ve seen over eight seasons, was grief-torched by Drogon after Jon Snow killed its mom. More thematically, the show that has been broadly about a society’s transition from murderous, dysfunctional dynastic rule and entitlement politics to a more collectivist model consummated that concept, killing off yet another conquering monarch and replacing her with an elected king. Of course the thing is, that king is Bran. It was one of several head-scratchers in a finale that, like much of the season, was a mishmash of poignant moments and puzzling turns. There were definitely some nice touches, like the dragon-wing shot of Daenerys and the nobles’ guffaws at the mere thought of actual democracy, one of the night’s funnier moments. In some ways, the finale was a compendium of “Thrones” greatest hits: There was yet another regicide, yet another jailing of Tyrion, yet another scattering of Starks. [Looking for something to watch now that “Game of Thrones” is over? Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] But the episode, directed by the creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff (who in the last few weeks have become the show’s biggest villains to a vocal fan segment), was also plagued by the same incoherence that has inspired abundant Twitter rage this season and at least one effigial petition. [HBO went to great lengths to keep the finale secret until it aired, professional bettors saw clear signs that key details had leaked and were trying to cash in.] There was Jon killing Daenerys and then escaping the immediate wrath of both Drogon — maybe his Targaryen blood helped — and the Unsullied, who instead took him prisoner hours after cutting people’s throats just for supporting Cersei, much less murdering their queen. (And how did they know what had happened, without a body? Did he confess?) There was the eternally fungible size of the Unsullied and Dothraki forces. There was also the weird pacing that has marred much of the past two seasons, since the show cut from 10 episodes a season to seven last season and then six in this one. On Sunday, minutes of screen time would be devoted to Jon walking and then, with a quick fade out and in, Tyrion had a bushy beard and the heads of Westeros’s big houses had suddenly appeared in the dragonpit. (Who summoned them?) After eight seasons of anguish and death that amounted to a case for a new political system — “We need to find a better way!” Davos urged — Tyrion laid the whole thing out in a few minutes, Scooby Doo-style, as Grey Worm glowered nearby but reluctantly went along with everything. It was clumsy and frustrating, especially because if you squinted, you could see how the outcomes could have been powerful if the lead-ups hadn’t been mismanaged. [Fans of ‘Game of Thrones’ griped about the finale’s pointy end — and a water bottle.] Jon’s assassination of Daenerys was the stuff of Greek tragedy — a man murdering his lover for the greater good. (And here’s where I brag about bringing up Maester Aemon’s “love is the death of duty” speech back in Week 2.) Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington gave moving performances, but the scene lacked the impact it deserved because the turn that got us there was unconvincing. Bran is in some ways a fitting choice for a kingdom that is looking to forge a different path. On a show frequently about how societies that forget their history are doomed to repeat it — in sectarian revenge cycles, conquering tyrants, sacks of great cities — Bran can see all of history. In a realm plagued by rulers who slaughtered their way into power, Bran is physically broken. In a tale in which pride and ego can lead to travesty, Bran has neither. Tyrion leaned hard into the humility argument and also into a cornier one about stories being the most powerful thing on earth. Bran got shoved from a tower and then became the Three Eyed Raven, Tyrion said. Who has a better story than that? (Rebuttal: Arya and Sansa, sitting on either side of him.) And as a bonus, Bran can’t sire a lunatic like Joffrey because he can’t have kids at all! But none of it changes the fact that Bran has long been one of the most unsatisfying characters on the show. He’s almost a man, as he told Jon back in the season premiere, but he’s mostly a tool of convenience designed to relay narrative information we couldn’t get otherwise — whether it’s scouting the White Walkers, revealing “Thrones” prehistory or dropping knowledge bombs. Bran theoretically has access to all information but seems to access it only when and in which way the story needs him to. This was reflected perfectly by his response to Tyrion’s pitch: “Why do you think I came all this way?” O.K., then why were you so hyped about telling Jon he’s supposed to be king a few weeks ago? [Use the comments to tell us how you thought the “Game of Thrones” series would end and how the outcome felt to you. What, if anything, do you think should have been done differently?] One response might be, because that’s what needed to happen — this is Bran’s response to pretty much everything, which makes it essentially meaningless. This all can sound like nit-picking, but internal logic is part of what gives a story power and resonance. In a show that was once defined by a kind of gritty realism within a fantastical setting, Bran is the ultimate cheat. So his promotion to the Rolling Throne was a sort of final confirmation that over the past couple of seasons, at least, the series became something different from what most of us signed up for. “Game of Thrones” became a global phenomenon largely by upending expectations, and one way it achieved that was by using the calcified conventions of the fantasy genre against us. The noble patriarch defined by his morals? Gone in the first season. The prince valiant son who followed his heart? Slaughtered along with his pregnant wife. The gentle giant who lived to protect a plucky young lad? Doomed in multiple ways by the actions of said lad. This was a Shakespearean saga about power, blood and loyalty, we once told our skeptical, fantasy-averse friends. Not some show about dragons and wizards. And then in its final episode, a dragon committed the story’s most potent symbolic act and a wizard was put in charge. It all could have worked better if the past two seasons had felt less like headlong rushes toward predetermined outcomes, at the expense of character and story believability. (Whatever that means in a dragon epic.) I might have even accepted King Bran the Broken and his “everything happens for a reason” rhetoric if the show had just … nah, actually, I probably wouldn’t have. But so many of the things that drove fans loudly crazy this season most likely wouldn’t have if they’d been given more room to breathe. (More on this in a minute.) The council that elected Bran included some of our favorite people, at least. This included the future Small Council members Sam (grand maester), Davos (master of ships), Brienne (lord commander of the kingsguard, maybe?) and Bronn, who in a fun twist was made master of coin. (As political commentary, putting a louche mercenary in charge of the treasury is pretty great.) Yara Greyjoy and Gendry were there, too. Randomly, so was the former Suckling Robin, Yohn Royce (I think?), and some other people I didn’t recognize. Edmure Tully made it out of Walder Frey’s cell, apparently, but he’s still the same goober he was when he went in. (Sansa: “Uncle, please sit.”) The mix of highborn and low was meaningful, and combined with the depictions of the Targaryen Regime — the Nurembergish rally, the tyrannical doublespeak about “liberating” people who had just been butchered — it unsubtly hammered home the show’s main themes: Power corrupts. Working together is our only hope. Of course, the defining pack of the show was scattered yet again to the corners of the earth. The parting of Sansa, Arya and Jon inspired real emotion, intensified by the fact that just as they would never see this family together again, neither would we. It was sad to see the Starks go their separate ways again, but they each got fitting ends. Sansa got a crown and an independent North, making her one of the few people in the show actually qualified for the job they have. Arya is off for further adventures in the land beyond the map. Jon is going back North to where he fit in best of all, a poignant end for a man who was always an outsider, even when he was at the center of things. He’s already made up for his diss of Ghost a couple of weeks ago. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there when you needed me,” Jon told Bran. “You were exactly where you were supposed to be,” he replied. Of course he was, Bran. Of course he was. Endings are hard, and this one was always going to be harder than most. That’s partly thanks to a story that methodically killed off its most interesting characters (and some of its best actors) as it winnowed into a more traditional good-versus-evil tale centered on its least interesting ones (Jon and Dany). And it’s partly because the things that established “Game of Thrones” as a phenomenon — the epic scale, the shocking twists — began to work against it. Plot swerves got more abrupt as the writers tried to stay ahead of the obsessive audience — without the benefit of a blueprint, once the show surpassed the books — and story was sacrificed at the altar of spectacle as the series strove to top itself over and over. And it’s partly because Benioff and Weiss failed to anticipate the ways in which dramatically abbreviating the last two seasons would exacerbate all of the above. I don’t pretend to understand the pressures of TV production — logic suggests that with the episodes getting ever more technically complicated, they would take longer to shoot, which results in fewer of them per season. But didn’t the show already take as much time as it needed, with months and months between some seasons? Why not go ahead and take as much as it takes to get to 10 episodes for those last two? For that matter, why not break up some of these supersize installments from this season into two separate ones that let moments land and things develop less frantically? I liked the Battle of Winterfell more than most people, but would it have felt less abrupt spread over two episodes? Would Jaime or Dany’s turns have felt more natural if they’d been given time to more gradually unfold? Yes, yes and yes. But now I worry that I’m starting to sound nit-picky again. And listen: For all of my kvetching, am I saying the show has been ruined, as so many former fans claim? Not at all. (I’m certainly not signing any goofy petitions.) I will always admire “Game of Thrones” and never forget the wonder of its most provocative moments — Hardhome, Hodor, the Red Wedding, Cersei’s coup, Arya’s killing of the Night King — and the beauty of its quieter ones. I was frequently astounded that such stunning and audacious artistry could be delivered into my living room. I kvetch because I care. I care because at its best, there was nothing else like “Game of Thrones” on TV or any other medium. • The power of stories and the tension between actual and recorded history were big themes in the finale, and in the show overall. In addition to Tyrion’s rhetoric on Sunday, we saw Brienne faithfully filling out Jaime’s story in the Book of the Brothers — a callback to Joffrey making fun of Jaime’s scanty entry in Season 4 — until she got to his final act. “He died protecting his Queen,” she wrote, a single-sentence gloss on one of the most complex and defining plots of this story. • Then Tyrion himself, the linchpin of so much of “Game of Thrones,” was entirely left out of “Song of Ice and Fire.” A popular theory held that Sam was ultimately going to be the one who wrote the story we’ve just watched. Close. Turns out it was Archmaester Ebrose (the head guy played by Jim Broadbent), but Sam helped with the title. • “There’s still a Night’s Watch?” Jon asked, speaking for all of us, when it was proposed to him. Yep, Tyrion said, but maybe there wasn’t after all? It just looked like Tormund and a bunch of Wildlings, and then they all headed north of the Wall. • Freed of their pillaging and storm-trooping responsibilities, the Unsullied are on their way to Naath, all 100 or 10,000 or however many of them are going to live the dream that Grey Worm hatched with Missandei back at Winterfell. Also, if you had Grey Worm in your survival pool, congratulations. Drinks are on you. • What did you make of the big finale? Did it make you mad about the rise of Bran the Broken? Sad about Jon’s expulsion? Glad Dany got her comeuppance? • And finally, each of us has a role to play, and now mine is done. But before I stagger toward the horizon like Melisandre and collapse into dust, I want to say thank you to everyone for reading and commenting over the past few weeks (or years). Daenerys, Jaime, Cersei, Jorah, Missandei, Ned, Robb, Rickon, Dickon, Hodor (Hodor) and about a billion others didn’t make it, but we’re still here. We were the watchers on the couches, and now our … wait, how does it go again? OpinionRoss Douthat",The New York Times
2019,"‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8, Episode 5 Recap: The Bells Toll for Daenerys","Game of Thrones I guess the coin landed on “burn them all.” Throughout the run of “Game of Thrones,” the seasons’ penultimate episodes were often the ones that packed in the most action and spectacular moments. So it was on Sunday, when the Last War unfolded broadly in the way many people expected, with the Dragon Queen turning heel and laying waste to King’s Landing. It was a thrilling, horrifying and ultimately frustrating episode, which feels weird to say because it was often amazing to behold and reflected some of the show’s most central themes. But it hinged on a turn that rang hollow — specifically the heel turn mentioned above. We talked at length last week about how the show has methodically broken down Daenerys in order to push her to the brink of madness — or some behavioral approximation thereof — culminating with Missandei’s beheading. On Sunday the last straw seemed to be Jon’s spilling his Targaryen secret and then essentially telling her, “I do love you but, ew, I can’t …” “Let it be fear then,” she replied stoically. But honestly, by then it was already a done deal. She’d sequestered herself in Dragonstone, her hair heartbreakingly disheveled in Missandei’s absence, and her overall look veering into Mad Queen Chic. [Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.” | Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] But just because the outcome wasn’t surprising, that doesn’t mean the result wasn’t spectacular. While the siege that led up to the King’s Landing apocalypse was plagued with some of the same strategic implausibilities and geographical confusion that has been an issue for much of this season, what followed was a terrifically and terrifyingly rendered decimation of a city. And the symbolic moment of the coin toss we kept hearing about, as Dany sat atop a conquered city and pondered her ultimate destiny, was no less tense for that destiny’s having been little in doubt. Of course the thing is, it actually should have been in doubt. The reason it wasn’t was because the show had so clearly telegraphed her turn for the past few weeks, if not longer. Dany got snubbed at Winterfell and saw her supportive boyfriend turn into a throne rival and then reject her, as her most trusted confidantes died in front of her while her quote-unquote Hand continued to give the worst advice in the Seven Kingdoms. (The surest sign that Dany would not heed the titular surrender bells came when she told Tyrion that she would — I can’t remember the last time the former cleverest man in the world was right about anything.) We all saw her face after Missandei’s execution — the would-be wheel-breaker had been pushed into a corner. And in fairness to the showrunners (David Benioff and D.B. Weiss) and writers, there have been plenty of indications throughout the show’s run that she wouldn’t respond well. From the beginning, Daenerys has been merciless with enemies like the witch Mirri Maz Duur, the Essos slave masters, the Lannister army and the Tarlys. Back in Qarth she promised to “lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground.” (Done and done.) As I wrote before this season began, messianic streaks as profound as hers can, like Targaryens, go either way. The problem is we’ve seen far more evidence that she has deep sympathy for the downtrodden, seemingly born of she herself being treated like chattel in the early phases of this story. It was the main driver of the viewer sympathy that just got upended on Sunday. “Game of Thrones” has been broadly about the futility of the cycles of revenge and violence, ultimately functioning as a critique of political structures based on raw power and entitlement. (Which perhaps describes most political structures; leave your broadsides in the comments if you must.) There is an interesting point to be made about how if you’re taking over the usual chair via the usual means, you’re just propping up the same old system with your own ambition. You may think you’re breaking a wheel, but all you’re really doing is changing the tire. In that swollen moment as the bells rang and everyone watched to see what the Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains would do, I thought she would fly straight for Cersei, her understandable flaming rage at the woman who has legitimately wronged her in multiple ways leading to the sort of tragic unintended consequences that can result from messianic leaders following impulsive instincts. But what we got was Dany deciding to methodically mass murder the exact same kinds of people she lifted up to forge her savior reputation. (Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, Scorcher of Innocents doesn’t have the same ring to it.) Did she actually go mad? Did Drogon decide to take matters into his own wings after Rhaegal’s death last week? Whatever the ultimate explanation, it didn’t really work, narratively, even if the visual expression of the idea that it is the commoners whose blood pays for the nobility’s power struggles was horrifically dazzling. The episode was beautiful at times, hard to watch at others. The director Miguel Sapochnik effectively mixed brutal images of wide-scale Drogon destruction and intimate tragedy — the incinerated bodies, holding one another — with more kinetic, claustrophobic moments of terror. The long tracking shot following Arya through the horror of the King’s Landing streets turned her into our avatar on the ground, cast about in the chaos. Once the burning started, the Dragon Queen got eager ground support from a bloodthirsty Grey Worm. (All the stabbing in the world won’t bring her back, Torgo.) The slaughter was effectively nauseating, as the army we’ve been rooting for chopped off heads and hands without mercy. Meanwhile, the Dothraki are just perpetually up for a good pillage, it seems. That won’t exactly redeem the show’s reputation for lazy exoticism — widely re-litigated after the Battle of Winterfell — but remember these are the guys who kill people for fun at weddings. (Although, so does nearly everyone else on this show, I guess.) Over all, it made for one of the show’s most gruesome episodes. For those irked by the relatively scanty death toll so far this season, well, on Sunday your cup runneth over. Varys was the eunuch in the coal mine, offering an early glimpse of the corner Daenerys had turned — less the fact that she dracarys’d him, her default response to open defiance, than the casual way she got on with it. This was a person for whom human life had ceased to matter as much as it should. Euron discovered that what is dead may never die, unless you put a sword in its guts and twist. Qyburn met the fate of all who play God, and he was dispatched by Mountainstein with its signature smash-and-toss finishing move. And the Hound discovered that what is actually dead may really, really never die, unless you shove it into the hellmaw of a burning city. (Even now I’m not positive a charcoaly Mountain torso isn’t scooting around King’s Landing like half a Terminator.) Then there were the toxic Lannister twins, whose grand fall was symbolized by the fact that they kick-started this whole story by fornicating in a northern tower and ended by dying in a southern crypt. It’s a testament to the dramatic talents of Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau that an incest reunion that took a somewhat galling amount of forced plot mechanics to enact still tugged at my heart strings. Cersei and Jaime were destined to die together, of course, whether he killed her or she killed him or they killed each other. The outcome was less interpersonally violent than most of us probably expected, which is perhaps oddly fitting for what, in the end, was the most enduring romance of this story. I just wish we’d gotten here more gracefully. If there’s anyone who’s been more narratively jerked around than Daenerys this season, it’s Jaime. We talked a few weeks ago about how his villainy was always overblown, and his trajectory since that tower liaison has been mostly about how people can get past the world’s definition of them by doing the hard work of trying to be good. (And if you have a warrior maiden around to help, so much the better.) Jaime tended to do the decent thing when he was apart from Cersei, and didn’t when he wasn’t. But Cersei’s double-cross of Team Living last season, which convinced him to head north and make amends, was finally one betrayal too many. Until it wasn’t. (Sorry, warrior maiden.) Last week he decided he was still bad and needed to head home. In the end he died with his pregnant sister-lover — we finally got that confirmed — and I guess we’re supposed to believe that that’s what he wanted all along. As the Hallmark card says: Love conquers all, even when it’s icky. So congratulations you crazy kids — I wish it all made more sense. As for Cersei, well she can perhaps take solace from the poetic symmetry of dying on Mother’s Day after her father, Tywin, died on Father’s Day at the end of Season 4. Cersei spent almost all of this season standing stonily on balconies and still managed to haunt the rest of the story with her presence. Even in this limited form, Headey’s performance remained one of my very favorite things about “Game of Thrones.” Like much else about this show, even in this occasionally disappointing season, I will miss having it in my life. • As I suggested, I’ve been frustrated by both Tyrion and Jaime this season. But put them together and … well I’m not made of stone. “You are the only one who didn’t treat me like a monster,” Tyrion told Jaime during what they and we knew would be the final meeting of the Brothers Lannister. “You were all I had.” What? I’m not crying, you’re crying … • So the Cleganebowl happened. Was it everything you hoped it would be? I was moved by the Hound’s emotion throughout the fight, which scanned as a sort of final realization about the fruitlessness of revenge, one of this show’s big themes, as we discussed earlier. (I was even more affected by his last admonitions to Arya before they parted.) And the final plunge into the flames was thrilling. But it all would have meant more if it hadn’t so transparently existed because it was what the fans wanted. Revenge is all I care about, and look what it’s done to me, Sandor (Sandor!) told Arya. The thing is, he didn’t really seem to care about revenge until around Season 7. • So did Varys actually get a letter out of Dragonstone, perhaps via his latest little bird? Or was he burning the only one he wrote right before he was taken? It wasn’t clear. If not, then he would seem to have died for nothing, which contradicts Melisandre’s suggestion last season that he had a role to play. • What an investment the Golden Company turned out to be. Those elephants should remember (sorry) to count their blessings at being left behind. • Probably crazy theory: Is there a chance Dany was torching King’s Landing as an elaborate effort to kill Jon, her rival for the Iron Throne? Look, I said it was probably crazy … • Jon, after fiery dragon cataclysm and untold carnage: “We need to fall back!” Oh, now you need to fall back. Always on top of things, that guy. • I guess those crack Scorpion marksmen from last week were furloughed? Did they even get more than a couple shots off this time? • You know who I’m guessing really didn’t like this episode? All those parents who named their daughters Khaleesi. • That final scene could have been Arya escaping for greener, or at least less ashy, pastures, her heart cleansed of her revenge lust by the close-up confrontation with so much murder. But I doubt we’ve seen the last of her. When Melisandre reminded Arya of her destiny to close green eyes forever as well as the others, we were led to believe those would belong to Cersei. But guess who else has green eyes. • What did you think? Did Dany breaking mad work for you? Which loss hurt the most? What do you want to see next week?

2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Theories Ranked: Which Are Still in Play?,"This article contains spoilers for Season 8, Episode 5 of “Game of Thrones.” “Game of Thrones” fans don’t just watch the show, they theorize. About everything. About prophecies or would-be prophecies from even the most minor characters. About plot lines and details from the books that aren’t even hinted at on the show. About unresolved mysteries and the unifying Theories of Everything that may explain them, no matter how outlandishly. Now that we’ve nearly reached the end, here are a few remaining theories that may help clarify some of the show’s remaining mysteries or predict its final moments, in order of plausibility: Azor Ahai was an ancient hero whom followers of the Lord of Light believe is destined to be reborn as the Prince or Princess Who Was Promised. Melisandre believed this was Stannis, then she believed it was Jon, then she seemed to believe that Jon and Dany together might have something to do with it. The rest of the Red Temple priests and priestesses have been preaching all along that this is Dany. According to prophesy, the revenant Azor Ahai is meant to prevent the Long Night, just as the original did thousands of years ago. One could argue, then, that Arya fulfilled that role, having killed the Night King. Still others believe that it will be a child born to Jon and Dany if she’s not as infertile as she thinks. (And if Jon ever decides he’s O.K. with incest. And if she lives long enough to find out). [Read our recap of Season 8, Episode 5.] But Azor Ahai had to sacrifice his beloved, Nissa Nissa, in order to defeat the darkness last time. Prophecy says the coming hero would have to do the same. If Jon is the new Azor Ahai, that might mean he would have to kill Dany. He certainly has reason to now. What do you think is heating the castle? According to canon, it’s the natural hot springs in and around Winterfell, which are used to geothermically heat its structures. But some fans think that system is heated by a dragon who’s just hanging out underground. That seems unlikely. Others believe a related theory based on a visit by Queen Alysanne Targaryen to Winterfell; rumor has it that her mount left a clutch of eggs behind. Perhaps during the post-battle cleanup, someone will find them. Bran Stark has been rather busy, according to some fans, altering a number of timelines and inhabiting the space of multiple Brandon Starks, including the infamous Bran the Builder, who gave Westeros the Wall. As with the “Bran is the Night King” theory that was so popular before the Night King died, this doesn’t seem to be where the show is heading. This is fueled by some fans who believe King Aerys II impregnated Joanna Lannister, Tywin’s wife, making Dany and Tyrion half-siblings. Aerys certainly lusted for Joanna, and he apparently took some liberties with her during Tywin and Joanna’s wedding-and-bedding ceremony. But did they have an affair, as Aerys’s wife seemed to suspect? Or did he rape Joanna? It’s impossible to know, but if Tywin had any reason to suspect that Tyrion wasn’t his child, he probably would have carried through with his plans to kill him as an infant. At any rate, this is a theory that Peter Dinklage himself has debunked. [Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.” | Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] How did he travel so fast between Pentos and Meereen? He swam, some fans say. Conleth Hill, who plays Varys, said in a recent interview that they may have smoked too much marijuana. “I still don’t get it,” he said. “Does it mean people think I have a fish tail? Varys stands up on dry land.” Was Cersei’s death — in the arms of her (ever-so-slightly-younger twin brother) Jaime — the fulfillment of a prophecy once uttered by a woods witch? We saw part of that prophecy in Season 5, when that witch, Maggy the Frog, predicted that Cersei would wed the king, not the prince; that she would be queen until a younger, more beautiful rival came along to cast her down; that the king would have 20 children and she would have 3; and that her children would die: “Gold will be their crowns, gold their shrouds.” [Cackles witchily.] Maggy’s prophecy continues in the books, however: “And when your tears have drowned you,” she says, “the valonqar shall wrap his hands around your pale white throat and choke the life from you.” Valonqar is a High Valyrian word for “little brother” (or male cousin), and so some readers interpreted this to be about Jaime. Cersei thought it was about Tyrion. Jaime’s hand was at Cersei’s throat during their mutual death scene, but he definitely didn’t choke her, voiding this aspect of the prophecy according to any but the loosest, most figurative interpretations.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘Avengers’: 2 Times Critics on the Power and Pain of Endings,"It’s been a blockbuster-filled few weeks. Aside from, perhaps, the song “Old Town Road,” the two biggest stories in popular culture have been the eighth and final season of “Game of Thrones” and the box-office behemoth “Avengers: Endgame,” which marks the end to a 22-film cycle of Marvel superhero movies that began in 2008 with “Iron Man.” Gilbert Cruz, the culture editor of The New York Times, moderated a conversation between James Poniewozik, chief TV critic, and A.O. Scott, co-chief film critic, about the two franchises. These are edited excerpts from the exchange, which contains spoilers. Given the economics of the movie and TV industry, given the instant internet feedback machine and given the mechanics of storytelling since time immemorial — are satisfying endings even possible here? JAMES PONIEWOZIK No. Sorry, I should elaborate? A franchise this size can have a thrilling ending, a beautiful ending, a heartbreaking ending. “Game of Thrones,” for instance, may yet come up with an ending that’s satisfying to me. A universally satisfying ending, though, is another matter. And maybe aiming for satisfaction is the problem. A megaseries, or a movie series, accumulates many masters by the end of its run. The book fans; the comics fans; the plot sticklers; the explanation-wanters; Team This Character and Team That Character. An ending can end up trying to cram in so many acknowledgments it’s like an Oscar speech. All this business of ending got me thinking of an older fantasy megawork: “The Lord of the Rings.” (Spoilers, I guess?) I tend to doubt that anyone reading or watching the story for the first time thinks: “You know, I’m really hoping Gollum’s the one who destroys the Ring.” People want their heroes to be heroic, to prove the power of the good in them. Instead, Frodo’s heroism isn’t good enough. It gets him almost to the end, but you need the despised, low villain to finish the job, if inadvertently. It’s a fantastic ending. But if “Rings” had been made serially — if Tolkien were getting an earful on Twitter from the Aragorn stans and the Samhive — would we have gotten it? I fear not. A.O. SCOTT You’ve put your finger on it. The problem isn’t the serial form. There are plenty of examples throughout history of long-form episodic narratives with great endings; “The Oresteia”; “Don Quixote”; the “Ring” cycle; “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” The problem is the fans. Or, more precisely, with the pernicious, pseudo-democratic, commercially craven idea of “fan service,” the idea that the point of a creative endeavor is to pander in advance to constituencies whose allegiance is somehow both fanatical and always in doubt. Fan service is surely the enemy of art. Now, as you say, it’s possible that “Thrones” will stick the landing. For the moment, though, it’s amusing and instructive to see Twitter tantrums erupt among some of the show’s most loyal partisans. Maybe their admiration always contained the seeds of disappointment, and the cultivation of enthusiasm was a prelude to betrayal. The fanaticism that is the root of the word “fan” can cut both ways. [Looking for a spoiler-filled conversation about “Avengers: Endgame”? The film’s screenwriters answer all your questions here.] PONIEWOZIK I guess we should define “fan service,” one of those terms that people (me included), use only as a pejorative, like “hipster.” I mean, an emotional resolution — say, Brienne being knighted for her long service — that serves fans. Do I call it fan service when creators satisfy my tastes? Of course not, because mine are noble and good! The problem is the “service” part. No one’s a servant here: Creators should be free to follow the story, and fans should be free to go elsewhere. It’s when stories become billion-dollar businesses that you get what I think of when I think of fan service, scenes that seem to exist mainly to tickle and reward superfans (like the “time heist” section of “Endgame” that operated as a clip reel of several previous films in the series). Maybe the best visualization of fan service I’ve seen is the “Simpsons” episode in which Homer gets to design a car. It has everything he wants — a bubble dome, a bucket-size cup holder, several horns that play “La Cucaracha.” It’s perfect for him. And it’s a monstrosity. In art, you need someone to nix that cup holder. It’s striking how much of the discussion around the endings of these two stories have to do with who’s going to die. “Endgame” foregrounded it and in the case of “Thrones,” it seemed like many were disappointed that more people didn’t die in Season 8, Episode 3’s big battle. PONIEWOZIK “Thrones” has a special relationship with death. It’s the show that kills people! “People” here meaning, “People who are not supposed to die on TV.” It earned its bones in season one, when Ned Stark, the seeming protagonist, was decapitated. Then the Red Wedding one-upped that. No one had “plot armor” on “Thrones” — until they did, and then, even if it kept around characters you liked, it felt false. The real betrayal may have been the resurrection of Jon Snow. It felt like the comic-book version of death, which is something akin to a bad cold. I mean I cried when Tony Stark (no relation) died. Robert Downey Jr. played the hell out of his final scenes. Those felt final, at least. But if someone sees a value in another Iron Man down the road, even another Tony Stark: hey, a lot of people can put on a suit. This disappointment isn’t, I hope, about a morbid desire for more whackings. It’s the feeling, deep down, that an ending needs to cost something to mean something. SCOTT Truthfully though, most endings are disappointing, at least in proportion to the complexity and interest of the story that came before. We feel let down partly because we’re just sorry something we’ve invested time and feeling in is over, but also because the force that held us in thrall is dissipating. The classical genres sidestep this problem by spoiling everything in advance. A tragedy ends in death, a comedy in a wedding, with some suspense about who dies or who gets married. The release an audience experiences at the end is partly relief that the order of things, disrupted by the anarchic forces of violence or desire, has been restored. Modern narrative is a different beast, of course, and what “Thrones,” which originated in a series of novels, shares with other canonical examples of the genre is a sense of multiple, branching possibilities, a thick and tangled middle full of intriguing loose ends. The tying up all that involves foreclosing some possibilities in favor of others. Solutions tend to be less exciting than mysteries. “Avengers” works in the opposite way. Since nobody expected an ending — intellectual property never dies — the final gestures of “Infinity War” and “Endgame” had more impact, felt more consequential. The concluding blood bath (or dust bath) in “Infinity War” was a fake out, of course (I wrote about that at the time), but it still landed with some force. As did the death of Tony Stark and the old age of Steve Rogers. And of course those denouements not only leave open the futures of other characters, but they also send the universe looping back toward the middle. What was Captain Marvel doing all that time? Is there any possible timeline where Tilda Swinton and Tessa Thompson can be on screen together? With two such dominant franchises ending within a few weeks of each other, it feels like this is putting a period on some yet-undefined pop-culture era. SCOTT I’m old enough to remember when series finales were a fairly rare thing. Most of the time, in the network era, shows just got canceled. The ones that made it to an official, intentional ending were a big deal, a chance for the whole family to say goodbye to people who had been guests in the living room for years. Television doesn’t quite work that way anymore, and there’s a sense in some of the writing about “Thrones” that it’s the last of its kind. (The critic Matt Zoller Seitz argued as much in a piece in Vulture before this last season began). It’s a premium cable show, but the numbers do suggest an impressively wide appeal. The more than $2 billion global box-office take for “Endgame” has already established it as an all-time blockbuster. Maybe we’re at the end of something more than just two popular fantasy stories. Or maybe we’re just witnessing the latest iteration of something that’s been building through the “Star Wars” and “Harry Potter” movies and the tv-is-the-new-novel prestige conversation pieces. Do “Thrones” and “Endgame” represent dinosaurs on the verge of extinction, or a new breed of alpha predator? PONIEWOZIK TV hits, like the Targaryens’ dragons, have shrunk over the decades. “Thrones” will not approach the 106 million live viewers of the “M*A*S*H” finale, international airings and illegal downloads notwithstanding. That’s the niche culture era for you. There will still be hits, but fewer people will experience them, and, thanks to streaming, not all at the same time. TV will be more like books. But also, TV is becoming like movies! Meanwhile, Marvel movies have functionally become TV series that sell popcorn. We’ve met, you and I, in the great gloppy muddle of 21st-century content. SCOTT So maybe you and I should trade jobs. Or maybe we already have the same job. We can fight that out in the sequel, or the next season, or the reboot …",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: 6 Great Articles to Read About Daenerys’s Dark Turn,"In the wake of Daenerys’s Sack of King’s Landing on “Game of Thrones,” many have grappled with possible motives, finding the explanations in the show’s weekly “Inside the Episode” video unsatisfactory. It’s personal (as one of the showrunners, Dan Weiss, says)? It’s like wanting more chocolate cake (as the actress Emilia Clarke says)? We get that Dany was hungry — she’d been skipping meals — but are the contents of her stomach (or lack thereof) the point, as the actor Andy Daly suggests? Perhaps they are, and not in the way people are thinking. [Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.” | Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] Few fans picked up on Varys’s apparent poison plot, and after assessing all the different reads on Dany’s behavior (see below), we have to wonder — did Varys actually succeed somewhat? Did some of his poison make it into her meals, possibly causing her to feel sick and then refuse more food? (Her skin had a sallow tone, which we initially attributed to her being in mourning.) If Varys dosed Dany with a slow-acting poison (affecting her mental state), it’s another example of history possibly repeating itself. After all, Varys was also suspected of poisoning Dany’s dad, the Mad King — not with literal poison, but with whispers of treason and traitors at every turn, stoking his paranoia. Thirsty for more assessments of “The Bells”? Read on (but watch your glass). ‘Daenerys Doesn’t Need to Be a Feminist Hero’ [Slate] “ ‘Game of Thrones,’ the show, is working off an ending delivered by George R.R. Martin, an ending that makes sense inside of the moral world he has created — where good and evil coexist inside the same people, war is awful, and history never ends. But in delivering that ending, the show is hitting viewers in the nose, extremely hard, with an idea that has been latent since the beginning: that rooting for anyone is a loser’s game.” ‘“Game of Thrones” Delivers Its Most Cataclysmic Episode’ [The Atlantic] “If the idea is that the ‘game’ itself — the unending contest for the Iron Throne — is broken, well, I imagine every viewer figured that out a few episodes into the first season. The characters whom audiences have been invested in for so long had been evolving into something new, pointing toward a deeper change for this rich and fascinating fantasy world. Instead, in “The Bells,” more often than not, characters reverted to their base nature.” ‘The Unearned Madness of Daenerys Targaryen’ [The Ringer] “In the chaos of ‘The Bells,’ the show forgot about the empathy that has been as fundamental to Daenerys’s character as her ruthlessness. She isn’t the Breaker of Chains for nothing. Daenerys used to personally save women from being raped by Dothraki warriors. She freed the Unsullied and countless other slaves. She took Yunkai, Astapor, and Meereen with minimal bloodshed, and she succeeded in creating a better world for the people in those cities. She wanted to rule, yes, but the girl who had spent so much of her childhood being bullied and tormented by more powerful men also knew what injustice was.” ‘“Game of Thrones,” The Bells’ [Los Angeles Review of Books] “If Daenerys wants the Iron Throne — and she does want it, it’s the only thing she wants and has always wanted, her entire character is built on wanting that one thing to the exclusion of all else — then she can’t let herself be a Ned Stark, having it both ways and dying in the middle ground. To win, she must follow Olenna Tyrell’s advice: Ignore the clever men (“the lords of Westeros are sheep”) and be a dragon. So that’s what she does. And because she all but tells Jon Snow that this is what she’s going to do, the only interesting question is why we aren’t listening when she says it. Are we as dumb as him?” “Invincible Arya illustrates just how ridiculous Game of Thrones has become” [The Week] “Arya then proceeds to be flattened by no fewer than about half a dozen collapsing houses, survive getting trampled in a stampede, evade a Dothraki attack and countless blasts of nearby dragon fire, and then, right when it seems like it must be her end, she stumbles on an uninjured horse and rides out of the city. I was so disoriented by her miraculous survival that I momentarily wondered if the horse wasn’t a metaphor for her death.” ‘Everyone Missed This Massive Hint at How Dany Might Die’ [Gamespot] “It’s a very Varys-like move; the Master of Whispers is always plotting, and frankly, his arc this season has felt uncharacteristically dumb. His plan was to approach Jon and Tyrion directly, and if they didn’t go for it, he’d just die? That’s not the Spider we used to know. But openly defying the queen — a classic, if risky, misdirect — while he secretly plots to poison her from the shadows? Now that’s more fitting.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: 8 Questions the Series Finale Must Answer,"With only one episode remaining, it’s unlikely “Game of Thrones” will tie up every loose end for us. But doesn’t the show owe us some degree of resolution to its major mysteries, and a judgment on the new villain its onetime hero has suddenly turned out to be? [Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.” | Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] This is a tall order for one episode, but here are some things we really want to know: There are so many theories about why Dany “snapped” and scorched King’s Landing. People in Westeros might say it was because of a Targaryen predisposition toward mental illness (although most purported earlier examples had other explanations). The showrunners claim the havoc-wreaking was a spur-of-the-moment decision, but Dany actually telegraphed it in words and actions long before. Or maybe the cause was Varys’s poison, if it had the time to to take effect after all. (Basilisk blood, in the books, is easily hidden in cooked meat and produces violent madness.) Or it could be somehow connected to her ineffable, magical bond with Drogon? Whatever the case, Dany now needs to provide us with an explanation — in words, not just unhinged facial expressions. Can she explain why the city’s surrender to her wasn’t enough to stay her hand? Does she realize that her picture will now be positioned in the Westerosi dictionary next to the word “overkill”? Is she too far gone to care? Someone (Tyrion? Jon? Grey Worm?) needs to talk to her about this. “Who’s lord of Storm’s End now?” Dany wondered during the post-battle feast at Winterfell, before she bestowed that title upon Gendry. This was a necessary honor: too long had power vacuums kept the various kingdoms in disarray. (We didn’t even know there was a new prince in Dorne until the last war-council meeting.) So who is in control of what right now? Sansa Stark rules Winterfell, of course, in the absence of Jon Snow, the Warden of the North, making her the de facto leader of the North. Meanwhile, Sansa’s cousin, Robin Arryn, is not only Lord of the Eyrie but Defender of the Vale and Warden of the East (although Lord Royce has been the commander of Robin’s forces and generally acting on his behalf). Theoretically, Sansa’s uncle Edmure, as Lord Paramount of the Trident, could return the Riverlands to Tully control; his status is unclear, however — is he still being held prisoner by House Frey? [Fans are betting on the outcome of the fight for the throne.] A legitimized Gendry Baratheon, now lord of Storm’s End, would rule the Stormlands, while The Reach would most likely be the preserve of House Tarly. Sam’s mother, Lady Melessa, might have been acting as Warden of the South after the deaths of Randyll and Dickon; if Sam heads back to Horn Hill, can he finally ascend to the lordship he had been denied? And what about Tyrion Lannister — might he not also still want to claim Casterly Rock as his birthright, and with it, the title of Warden of the West? And finally, Yara Greyjoy should have the Iron Islands under her command by now. Before Dany destroyed King’s Landing, she should have been able to count most of these Houses as allies (save the Tarlys). We don’t know who Varys wrote to, or how many ravens he was able to send before his death — or if his “little bird” Martha knew to send them after. But if word spreads of Dany’s genocide and Jon Snow’s lineage, many of Dany’s alliances will crumble. The question is, would that make a difference? Even if the other regions are able to assemble fresh forces (and that would be difficult for those who just fought alongside Jon Snow), it might not be enough. One dragon can wipe out an army. If Varys were smart — which he generally was — he would have also notified the Citadel, the Iron Bank, the House of Black and White, the Red Temple — any institution in Westeros and Essos with any sort of influence or power. Remember Varys’s riddle: Power resides where people believe it resides. There are effective ways to resist tyranny (and dragons). But if Dany is to be eliminated quickly, an assassin might be required. Someone she trusts, and who can get past the fearsome Drogon. Arya Stark went to assassin school in Braavos, where she picked up some very useful skills. But she hasn’t utilized one of the most important ones in quite a while. Which is to say, where are all her faces? Did she bring any with her from Winterfell? How was she expecting to get past Cersei, her original target? And if she decides to select a new target, does she have spare faces to help out? Twice in this series, Tyrion Lannister has been accused of crimes — murders and attempted murders — that he did not in fact commit. In attempting to defend himself against such charges, he usually resorted to trial by combat. But if Dany accuses him of treason — for freeing his brother Jaime, her prisoner — Tyrion actually would be guilty. How will he talk himself out of this one? Dany promised to destroy the metaphorical wheel of power in order to create a better world. But she never said how she intended to do that. (Somebody should have asked.) If she were to be defeated, will Jon pursue his claim or abdicate the throne? Will the throne be destroyed? (Hopefully Drogon will live long enough to melt it.) What about the idea of monarchy? What form of government could best replace the current one? Will anyone suggest, as Tyrion once did, adopting the democratic methods of the Night’s Watch or the Iron Islands? Will anyone dig back in Westerosi history and suggest the re-establishment of a Great Council? Or how about glancing at the political setup in Essos, across the Narrow Sea? Or maybe something altogether new … For all of the actions taken on behalf of the “common people,” it’s rare that the commoners themselves are consulted. Which leaves us to wonder: How much do they really know about what has happened? Do they even know who Daenerys Targaryen is? Did they consider Queen Cersei a tyrant? These are people who once rioted in the streets (in Season 2) and ripped the High Septon limb from limb when they thought the monarchy was failing them. How do the survivors of the Sack of King’s Landing, if there are any, feel about it now? (We can probably guess the answer to that one.) Did Bran Stark know about the blood bath in advance? He has had troubling visions since Season 4, including Drogon cruising over a smoking King’s Landing and an ashy throne room (which matched Dany’s own vision from Season 2). Both Bran and Dany had glimpses of the future, but perhaps didn’t recognize what they were seeing at the time. (What turned out to be ash looked in these visions like snow.) Unlike Dany, though, Bran has had a chance to pause and rewind. Did he watch more of the horror unfold? Did he recognize what Dany was going to do, and if so, why did he not share this information with anyone? Was it an ethical dilemma for him? (If so, we need to see him wrestle with that.) Also, could Bran actually intervene in the timeline? Or, remembering the repercussions with Hodor, would he choose not to meddle? How could he justify remaining silent about a disaster that has claimed thousands of lives, while at the same time nudging Jon Snow into a position where he could claim the throne afterward? What is Bran’s agenda? For that matter, what good is an ability to see into the future in this world? Melisandre’s visions, when she backed Stannis, also caused disasters — but they nudged Arya to kill the Night King as well. Cersei’s downfall can in part be attributed to her obsession with Maggy the Frog’s fortunetelling (which turned out to be mostly accurate); if Cersei hadn’t perceived Margaery Tyrell to be the promised threat (instead of Dany), perhaps she wouldn’t have accumulated so many enemies. Dany, too, obsessed about a witch’s words — she thought they meant she would never have children again. How much did that perhaps erroneous belief shape her path and enable her savior complex? The Prince/Princess Who Was Promised, the Stallion Who Mounts the World — are these prophecies real, or is it dangerous to believe in any such cryptic concepts, real though they might actually turn out to be? Melisandre attributed Beric Dondarrion’s many resurrections to the Lord of Light, who she said kept the man alive for a purpose: to save Arya at a crucial moment, so she could then defeat the Night King. Well, if that’s true, why did the Lord of Light bring dead Jon Snow back to life? Does the Lord of Light even exist? Or have the priests and priestesses of the Red Temple mistakenly attributed their own magic to a god? And let us not forget all the people worshiping the old gods, who turn out to be a psychic network that uses the weirwood trees to spy on everyone. Would this make Bran a god? Where is the line between magic and religion, and which is the most powerful? Although faith never died out in this world, magic did — until the events of this story, which saw its resurgence. Why did magic return to the world when it did? And what will it take to restore balance in this world?",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: Bran on His Future and the Night King’s Ultimate Fate,"This article contains spoilers for the first three episodes of Season 8 of “Game of Thrones.” With the death of the Night King and Melisandre in the Battle of Winterfell, one of the last remaining supernatural forces in Westeros is Bran Stark, a.k.a. the Three-Eyed Raven (Isaac Hempstead Wright). He can warg, he can see the past, present and future (sort of), and he can beat just about anyone in a staring contest. His importance is such that the Night King raised an entire army of the dead in his efforts to vanquish him — to erase him would be to erase the world’s memory. But instead of fighting back on a supernatural level, Bran sat back during the battle, as part of a strategy to lure the Night King into a vulnerable position. Should he have played a more active role? Warged a dragon? Shared battlefield intelligence? Invaded the Night King’s psychic space? Perhaps. Fans speculated that he was doing all of these things and more, but had no real answers. Until now. During a phone interview this week, Hempstead Wright went deep on the Three-Eyed Raven, his role in the battle and his purpose beyond that. Following are edited excerpts. So let’s talk about what Bran was doing during the Battle of Winterfell. My involvement was small, compared to most people. I only did two weeks of night shoots, and they were there for 55 nights. The hard part for me is just sitting there, and staying put, keeping the furs in place for continuity. I can’t get up. So when the director yells, “Cut!” everyone else can wander around and have a chat, and I’m stuck in the courtyard yelling, “Hey, guys! Come out and hang out near me so I can talk to you!” I think everyone would get angry, though, if I complained that I had to sit down with loads of warm furs. [Laughs] I’ve got a pretty all right deal there. So it was great to see what everybody else was up to! It just goes so quickly. It doesn’t feel like an hour and 20 minutes, because everything is so high stakes. But Bran’s role in it? [Laughs] He’s not going to be right at the forefront. There’s not a lot Bran can contribute on the battle side. Maybe not physically, but there is a moment where he is doing something. He wargs into the ravens to do some aerial reconnaissance, but that dissipates pretty quickly and he remains in that state. What was he doing? As far as I understand it, he’s just in the ravens. He’s just keeping tabs on the battle. But having lots of shots of ravens flying around wouldn’t be much of interest! [Laughs] And it would be pretty impractical for him to be like, “Hey, Theon, can you go run over there and tell this guy to get out of the way of that guy?” Bran recognizes that all he can do is sit there and let whatever happens, happen. We saw how quickly all their plans disintegrated! There would have been no chance of an efficient communication system. [Laughs] Ah, O.K. Whenever Bran does anything lately, the internet explodes with theories. [Laughs.] I thought this battle might have put some of those theories to rest. Evidently not! Such as the popular one that Bran was actually the Night King. That’s finally debunked now? Yeah. The Night King is dead. I can’t see how Bran is the Night King, or was the Night King. Although they did share a meaningful look. What was going on between them, in that moment? The reasoning behind that wasn’t actually in the script, but [the director Miguel Sapochnik] and I came up with this idea that the look Bran gives the Night King is one of pity. Bran saw the creation of the Night King, or the first White Walker, or whatever. He realizes that he was once just a normal guy who was forcibly strapped to a tree, and had a piece of dragonglass plunged in his heart. He didn’t ask to become this raving, crazy ice killer. So it’s a bit like a Frankenstein’s monster scenario. He was forced into this situation, and he was trapped into this Night King’s body, and programmed to kill everyone. So we tried to get a moment where Bran is feeling sorry for him. Bran is looking at this ancient being who didn’t want to become this murderer, but is. And the reason the Night King takes so long is that he’s been programmed to destroy the Three-Eyed Raven from the moment he was created, so he’s taking a moment to savor it. There are even people now trying to make a case for Bran being evil. Interesting! [Laughs] Well, you’ll have to wait to see if he’s up to no good. What do you think about how Bran’s arc is saying about the story’s larger theme of predestination versus free will? How much does he see from the future and set in motion? He gave Arya this dagger last season in just about the very spot where she ends up using it. As I understand it, Bran can’t exactly see the future. I think he can have inklings. When Bran gives Arya the catspaw dagger, he knows there’s something important to do with it, but he doesn’t know that say, six months on, she’s going to use it to stab the Night King. So I think it’s still indeterminate, and not classical causal mechanics, where he just views things as actions that follow from one another. There’s still some uncertainty. [Read more about the complex history of the catspaw dagger.] He’s not a chessmaster putting people into position. No, I don’t think he knows anything other than it’s important that Arya get that blade. He doesn’t necessarily know why. Even if Bran did know everything that happened in the future — the reason, in my opinion, that Bran is so quiet and doesn’t necessarily choose to give everything away is that the Three-Eyed Raven is trained to be very calm and still, because he knows that the information that he has could be used for all sorts of purposes. If any of the normal people knew anything about the past, or any sort of vague things that might happen in the future, it would probably change the way things unfold. People would end up making the wrong choices, or doing things based on what Bran’s told them. The very purpose of the Three-Eyed Raven is to be the one who is wise, and still, and careful enough to handle this information and not just go blabbering it about, because that would affect the outcome. He’s very cautious with what he reveals to people, because he’s aware that time has to unfold naturally. And yet, he seems to be directing people somewhat. He shuts down the conversation when Dany arrives at Winterfell: “We don’t have time for this.” And just after Sam has found out that his father and brother were killed, he doesn’t give him time to mourn. He insists that this is the moment to go tell Jon about his heritage. It could be read as manipulative, that he’s using Sam’s emotional state to influence how Jon receives the news. Bran doesn’t care. It’s totally irrelevant to Bran that Samwell Tarly’s family has died, unfortunately. The Three-Eyed Raven doesn’t see things in terms of personal sadness. He just sees things in terms of the way things must unfold, or the way time goes. He’s not going to go, “Oh, I’m sorry, Sam. I hope you feel better in a minute.” He just sees things that have to happen next, and the importance of those things far outweighs any personal tragedies that might occur. It sounds brutal! But that’s been the role of the Three-Eyed Raven for millennia. To sit there, watching, carefully. He doesn’t sit there judging. He doesn’t sit there advising. He just sits there keeping an eye on history and time. Well, there are some contradictions within that. If he doesn’t fully know the future, how does he know what has to happen next? If he isn’t concerned with people’s emotions, why would he steer Sam to tell Jon at just the exact moment when the news would be somewhat tainted by his perception that Dany could be an unfit ruler? That might just be for dramatic tension. But yeah, good point. [Laughs] This is all conjecture on my part. I’ve never actually gone through a very detailed analysis of what exactly Bran’s powers are with [the showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss]. To be honest, I don’t think they really want to do that. It would become like a superhero movie, if we knew every way that Bran’s powers worked and what exactly he can do. It’s best to keep that sense of mystery and an unknown to it. Beyond his powers, Bran’s also able to help validate the redemption of other characters, such as Jaime previously and Theon in this battle. Both of them have done really awful things to him in the past, and have tried to rectify that. And perhaps because Bran is beyond caring, it’s very easy for him to forgive? I don’t think it’s a question of Bran forgiving them. There’s nothing personal when Bran tells Theon, “You’re a good man.” What he’s basically doing there is that he knows that Arya is running and charging on her way to save the day, and Bran recognizes that he needs to buy some more time. And that’s a real moment there where Theon could give up again, as we’ve seen him do several times before. He looks at the Night King like, is he just going to run away or give up? And Bran recognizes that Theon needs that final push to give it one last go, to buy enough time for Arya. So there is a little bit of manipulation. Yeah, but I don’t think it’s manipulation on his part. It’s not for anything selfish for Bran’s ego. It’s for the Three-Eyed Raven. He recognizes that the Three-Eyed Raven has to exist. If you look back in time, Bran isn’t bothered by the death of Hodor, because that’s what had to happen to allow him to get away from the White Walkers. Bran views them as a necessity for the greater good, not for himself, but for the world, for time, for history. You said he’s very careful about sharing that information. But what about coordinating with, say, the Citadel to update their historical records? Why be the sole proprietor, who can be killed, when some of this information could be recorded and shared to benefit a greater number of people? The reason that you have a Three-Eyed Raven is that you need to be sensible to guard this information. Even in our world, if we knew every single precise thing that went on in history, the world would probably be a very different place. I think the job of the Three-Eyed Raven is to keep the information and decide what to be shared. The previous Three-Eyed Raven, and all the Three-Eyed Ravens before him, they didn’t share information. They sat there, and they waited. They just kept abreast of everything. So I don’t know whether that’s something would be on Bran’s agenda. It’s like he’s Google, and only one person has internet access. Yeah, I guess. But I wouldn’t want Cersei to have Google, would you? [Laughs] “101 Ways to Use Wildfire.” There are plenty of people who could use that information, and Bran recognizes the potential that it could fall in the wrong hands. It’s far too dangerous. He can look up anything in history, and it’s not just uploading images anymore. He can just go, “What happened on the 5th of November of this year,” or whatever, and look it up with some precision. I think what the previous Three-Eyed Ravens did is they sat there in the cave, and they went through every single day in the history of the world. Obviously, Bran hasn’t had time to do all that yet. He’s only been the Three-Eyed Raven since the end of Season 6. Vladimir Furdik, who plays the Night King, reminded us on Twitter of the importance of his touch. He marked Bran before, but with his death, is that completely gone? Or is it still there? It’s still there. It’s kind of like frostbite. But if the Night King is dead, I can’t see how it will have any supernatural connection anymore. Without a Night King, it’s redundant. [The Night King speaks: Read an interview with Vladimir Furdik.] You tweeted that you love the Bran memes: “Keep ‘em coming.” Most of them are about the Three-Eyed Raven stare, which is basically just because you can’t see without your glasses. Yeah I kind of like that, because it makes you feel distant and removed. You’re sitting there, and you can’t see what’s going on, so you’re forced to become a bit more interior, thinking about things. Bran’s not going to be sitting there playing “I Spy,” looking at different things. He’s sitting there inside his head. So I think not having my glasses kind of helps. I probably made my vision sound worse than it is — it’s really not that bad. But if I take them off, it’s a bit blurry. But to be honest, with the Battle of Winterfell, the last thing on my mind was how people were going to react in a comedic way. It was such a hard shoot, and so focused and intense, the only thing I thought as far as audience reaction was how astonishing they’d find it. But I really do love when people respond with memes and comedy. It’s great fun. And there are some really original ones. It’s a testament to how much people love the show that they come up with these funny little things that refer to these moments. Do you ever worry if those responses could turn Bran into comic relief? No, I don’t. You’ve got to let people laugh, and you’ve to laugh at yourself. It would be really pompous if we said, “You can’t make a joke about Bran because he’s a very serious person.” Anyone who watches Episode 3 and thinks it’s hilarious or meme-worthy, that doesn’t change that it’s still utterly dramatic and terrifying and captivating. You can still enjoy the comic relief after. Could Bran’s watching in a way be a meta-commentary about the show’s pacing and the audience watching? Yeah! He could be a parallel to the audience, an audience surrogate, in that the audience also isn’t able to contribute much, in the sense that the audience can only watch just as Bran can only watch. I don’t know if that’s intentional, but I just like the fact that Bran is a very still character, because there aren’t many people in “Game of Thrones” who are content with just getting by, and letting things happen, and just watching them and observing. It’s nice to be one of the people who isn’t reactionary, who isn’t charging around and stabbing things or whatever, but remains calm. It’s quite refreshing.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: Carice van Houten on Melisandre’s Final Act,"This article contains spoilers for Season 8, Episode 3 of “Game of Thrones.” If you’re planning a battle against supernatural forces of ice, a red priestess with a magical relationship to fire should probably be on your speed dial. Fortunately for the folks at the Battle of Winterfell, as seen in Sunday’s episode of “Game of Thrones,” Melisandre (Carice van Houten) showed up offering exactly that, despite having been told that a return to the North would get her executed. Her actions — setting weapons and trenches aflame, providing key pep talks — helped give the living a victory over the dead, but it came at a cost. As she predicted, she had to die in this strange country, and she did so willingly. During a phone interview on Tuesday, van Houten looked back at her complicated character. Following are edited excerpts. This is a huge episode for Melisandre. Do you feel that it gave you a satisfying conclusion for your character? I sort of felt it coming, back when I said to Varys in Season 7 that we were both going to die, basically. I felt like I had it coming. And I was actually happy and quite sentimental when I read the script. I thought it could be a beautiful ending to this character. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen the episode yet. I’m going to do it tonight. I’m very, very late to the party. I remember shooting it, though, very vividly. It ended on an elegant note, and it was emotional, which we haven’t seen as much in her story line. I’ve gotten so many reactions from people, too, which really means a lot, to be honest. [Read our recap of Season 8, Episode 3 of “Game of Thrones.”] I’m hoping you’re getting much kinder responses than some of the hateful ones you used to get, and sometimes still do, when people conflate you with your character. Yeah. [Laughs] I’ve never felt personally threatened. I always just liked that they loved to hate me. I don’t mind if they hate the character, but when they start mixing my character up with myself, then it becomes a bit weird and unpleasant. And Melisandre, at least, deserved that at some point. It’s a logical, sane reaction to her deeds, to tell her to [expletive] off. If you’re burning children alive, what the hell? That’s also why I think the show is so good, because it keeps playing with people’s morals and with people’s sympathies. It confuses people about characters, and I love that, because the world’s not black and white, and people are not black and white. I’ve also gotten some really lovely texts from Gwendoline Christie, Liam Cunningham and other cast members about how happy they are. I was just really happy that they felt for Melisandre. People underestimated her character arc and her complexity, and I was very happy that people don’t see her as a flat character or just pure evil or whatever. I was happy to be able to give her some humanity in the end. Did you fill in the blanks for yourself in terms of what happened for her between when we last saw her, in Season 7, and this moment? She said she was heading to Volantis, and somehow between then and now, her power increased. Any idea of what happened during her time off, or how she determined to be at the Battle of Winterfell at just the right moment? You can speculate about all of that, but I don’t know. Not really. [Laughs] The character has been a mystery even to myself all these years, and I’ve struggled with her. Like, what is she about, man? What is her goal? How old is she, really? But sometimes not knowing, I think, has helped me. I can project my own stuff onto her and use my own imagination, my own personal things. It always felt like it added up somehow, and she knew she was here for a reason, even if she couldn’t always pinpoint it. She needed the visions in the fire to tell her where to go. She needed the Lord of Light, and he or she or it guided her there. And I don’t think she thinks it’s even her doing this. She doesn’t think she has any power. She’s always been really honest about that. “It’s not me. I’m just a vessel.” [Read about Melisandre’s history and her relationship with the gods of fire and ice.] True, but she could have power that she mistakenly attributes to a god. She’s been wrong before. Yeah. And that has definitely affected her. But bringing Jon Snow back definitely gave her some of her confidence back, I think. What was it like shooting the scene in the trench? That was literally the last scene I shot. It was funny because it was so undramatic, because it was happening in a big studio with lots of green screens and fake bodies. But it was also loaded with emotion because I had to say goodbye. It fit the scene for me. It was really clear to me in that moment that Melisandre wasn’t there for her own sake. She has never been in it for her own sake. And I hope you can see that emotion coming out of her, that she has to save us all, in a way. There is a lot of empathy and hope there, even if you can’t understand the words she’s praying. So it was intense. It looks spectacular when she lights the Dothraki weapons, but that doesn’t end up doing much good. It also looks spectacular when she lights the trench, but that doesn’t last long. The most effective thing she does during this battle is give a pep talk to Arya. Exactly! I really loved that sort of girl power moment. I’m like, “You go get ’em.” That sort of thing. “You go girl.” I think that also gave some lightness to her character and brought some modern humanity to her, which I really loved. It was just so satisfying. And I knew they were going to come back at some point to the “brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes” thing. It wasn’t random. It was significant. And of course, a lot of smart fans already picked up on that. They probably knew it before I knew it! How did you interpret the final scene when she removes the necklace, removes the glamour illusion, walks off as an old woman and collapses? What did the final image convey to you? My work is done here. I’ve served my purpose. I’m tired. In a way, it’s a sort of sacrifice. I mean, suicide sounds a bit too strong, but it is. She’s old. She longs for peace. She’s done. And yet, she’s not entirely done. There’s still so much about her that we don’t know that would have been great to explore. Her previous life, how she got to be where she was, the secrets she kept, what happened when she was a slave, what happened before she was even associated with this religion … I agree! That has been — not a frustration, but I have longed for that as well myself. I would have loved to know more, and see more, about that. Because she’s so mysterious, it leaves you a bit hungry. But that’s okay. I sort of like that. Better that than to feel fed up! Maybe they could fit her in one of the prequel successor series. Melisandre lived longer than most of the other characters, so she could be around during Aegon’s Conquest or the Dance of the Dragons, or other historical events. And I can still do that! [Laughs] I’m still available to be hired as an actress. I can do more if people have fun ideas! You almost feel that she’s been burdened by this religion, so you want to see her when she started out, when she was young and innocent. I would be really interested to see her as a child, in fact. I would love that. But as much as it was painful and sad to have this end, it always feels like this is just the way it had to be. It was a great seven years, and it was the perfect time.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: Even Dragons Have Their Limits,"This article contains spoilers for Season 8, Episode 4 of “Game of Thrones.” So your dragon was hit by weapons, swarmed by wights, chomped up and sent crashing to the ground or into the water? This, of course, is what happened to Dany and Jon’s faithful mounts, Drogon and Rhaegal, during the Battle of Winterfell in last week’s episode of “Game of Thrones,” and it just happened again on Sunday to poor Rhaegal. Even dragons have limits, Dany. Maybe they should have gotten a little R ’n’ R in-between? It’s never a good idea to take a wounded battle beast into another battle right away, even if it seems able to fly. Dany should have learned this after her first flight with Drogon: Dragons are pretty resilient, if given plenty of food and recuperation time, preferably in a very safe space. Not letting a dragon rest, however, is a recipe for disaster. Didn’t she see that Rhaegal was struggling to fly? He had holes in his wings! [Read our recap of Season 8, Episode 4.] If you’re going to rest your dragon, it probably shouldn’t happen in the North — snow and ice tends to make dragons peevish. If they’re able to fly, a change of scenery can be useful. Dragons thrive, for example, in seaside locales like Dragonstone. Also, given the prodigious amount of food a recovering dragon requires, a bountiful supply of fish can preclude any drain on the local livestock population. (While they were in the North, Drogon and Rhaegal were eating 18 goats and 11 sheep a day. And even that wasn’t nearly enough.) But that seaside locale needs to be far away from disputed or hostile waters. That should have disqualified Dragonstone, which is hardly more than a stone’s throw from King’s Landing. Also, the flight from Winterfell to Dragonstone would be a very long and tiring one. Not that she was planning to rest her babies there properly anyway. Most of what we know about dragon trauma dates from the Targaryen civil war called the Dance of the Dragons, and the story of King Aegon II’s magnificent beast Sunfyre, said to be among the most beautiful dragons ever seen. After one battle, both the king and his mount were gravely injured, with Sunfyre sustaining a torn wing that left it unable to fly. Since the dragon was too heavy to move, it had to be abandoned in the field, where at first it feasted on the carcasses of the slain, and then on the calves and sheep provided by the king’s guards left behind to protect the creature. Before long, the king’s enemies came to slay Sunfyre, expecting to find it near death. But the dragon was only dozing, and the attackers’ first spear aroused it, drawing a blast of angry fire. Sunfyre struggled to fly away but was not yet strong enough and fell to the ground a few times. After the few surviving attackers fled, the dragon, now doubly wounded, somehow managed to flee the scene — although it isn’t exactly clear how. There were no track marks to indicate dragging or crawling, and the dragon was thought unable to fly. For six months, no one knew were Sunfyre was, but there were signs that it spent some of that time hidden away in some dark woods and caves near a remote fishing village. The dragon’s torn wing eventually healed enough for it to fly, although not very well and only for short distances. This recovery indicated that dragons, like bats, have a patagium membrane, which is fragile and prone to tearing, but also highly regenerative. With time, Sunfyre was able to fly across to Blackwater Bay (killing another dragon en route and sustaining fresh injuries) and finally make its way back to Dragonstone, where it rejoined the recuperating King Aegon. And although Sunfyre had been maimed three times by this point, it nevertheless took to the sky every day with its rider, and together they both began regaining their strength. Unfortunately, Sunfyre hadn’t completely healed when King Aegon tried to fly it into the Dragonstone castle — and yet another battle. Sound familiar? In that battle, a much younger and faster dragon named Moondancer took Sunfyre down, nearly tearing its half-healed broken wing from its body, gouging out an eye and ripping mouthfuls of flesh from its neck. But when the two dragons finally fell to the ground, it was Moondancer who died and Sunfyre who lived, if barely. Sunfyre never flew again and remained where it had fallen, feeding on Moondancer’s carcass, on slaughtered sheep and even on King Aegon’s main rival for the throne, his half sister Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen. (This was one of the more macabre historical moments Joffrey mentioned to Margaery Tyrell). As weeks passed, Sunfyre’s neck wounds began to fester and its dragon smoke took on a foul odor; eventually, it stopped eating altogether and died. If Sunfyre had been allowed sufficient recovery time, it might have lived to breathe fire and snack on sheep for a long time. Dragons can live for hundreds of years when given food and freedom. And if Dany had applied that lesson to her own dragon-children, giving them the proper care instead of rushing to retake Dragonstone, a revived Rhaegal might have been able to take fresh injuries or handle evasive maneuvers. So much for that idea. Rest in peace, Rhaegal.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Game of Thrones’: Joe Dempsie on Gendry, Arya and His Shot at the Iron Throne","This article contains spoilers for Season 8, Episode 4 of “Game of Thrones.” Gendry, the bastard boy whose existence helped prove that Queen Cersei’s children were not fathered by King Robert and set into motion the War of the Five Kings, is a bastard no longer. [Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.” | Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.] For his service forging dragonglass weapons key to Winterfell’s defense, Daenerys bestowed Gendry with legitimacy and a lordship on Sunday, giving him the Baratheon ancestral seat of Storm’s End. She might have done a bit more than that, given that a legitimate Baratheon could be a rival for her claim to the throne. In a phone conversation this week, the actor Joe Dempsie shared his thoughts on Gendry’s ambitions and the controversy surrounding his character’s love scene with Arya. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Congratulations might be in order now that Gendry’s been legitimized and made Lord of Storm’s End … Yeah, it’s sort of been a roller coaster, right? I don’t think the title necessarily means that much to him, but the recognition that comes with it and the fact that he’s been legitimized does. It probably means the world to him, the acknowledgment that he belongs. Gendry’s story, leading up to this point, has been searching for his place and his purpose in this slightly pompous world, and I think he finally got it, to an extent. And then he got all excited and carried away with himself, didn’t he? [Laughs.] We’ll come back to his proposal to Arya, but first, let’s examine what it means for him to be legitimized. I’m not sure if Dany thought it through, or perhaps she did, but she just gave Gendry the best claim to the Iron Throne. Outside of Jon Snow, do you think? Ahead of Jon Snow? Yeah. The Targaryens were removed from office, so to speak, and the line of succession since has been derived from King Robert. That’s why Joffrey, Tommen, and then Cersei were able to make claims. And Gendry, unlike Joffrey and Tommen, is actually King Robert’s son. So he’s the linear heir to the throne, now that he’s been legitimized. I think by recognizing the potential threat he causes, Dany’s attempting to neutralize it. What none of us really know yet is how much does Dany know about Gendry? Did she do any research? Because she’s taking a huge risk. In Season 8, we’re really seeing the effect of what all this yearslong obsession for the throne has done to Daenerys, you know? You can see it in Jon Snow’s face, every time she expresses her concern about their secret. Only it’s not that much of a secret anymore, is it? More people know about it now, Jon Snow’s true parentage. But she seems far less concerned about the fact that she’s his aunt, and far more concerned about what this will do to her claim to the throne. If you found out that the woman you were dating was your aunt, wouldn’t you be more bothered by the accidental incest? Especially if I was in love with her. “What are we going to do about this? I’ve already fallen in love with you, and you’re my auntie.” And you can see that in Jon Snow’s eyes. “Really? That’s the thing that’s bothering you right now? What it’s going to do to your claim?” Jon keeps saying he doesn’t want to be king, but what about Gendry? I’m not sure he realized, before this, that he could be a lord, let alone a king. If he realized he could have a claim, would he want it? My instinct tells me no. Varys said in the episode this week that maybe the person best suited to rule might be someone who doesn’t actually want to. I think Gendry has spent such a large part of his life being kind of passed around as a pawn, and control over others isn’t something he’s ever craved. Maybe he’s not quite bright enough to rule, but he certainly understands the plight of common folk in a way that not many past leaders of Westeros have. So I think he would be a very compassionate leader. Gendry’s been searching for his place in the world, and he had this innate feeling that he was destined to be a part of something bigger or more important. He wanted his life to have meaning. He found that when Davos found him in King’s Landing in Season 7. He was like, “This is it. I didn’t know what it was that I’ve been waiting for, but I’ve been getting ready for it.” His part in the Battle of Winterfell fulfilled that desire for his life to have some meaning. Being legitimized solidified that for him. I don’t know that there’s a craving for greater power, but we’ll have to wait and see. It all depends on what kind of a character Gendry really is. When they first brought you back to the show, you said you pumped up at the gym in anticipation of a shirtless scene, and then you were disappointed there wasn’t one. You got to have that this season. Yes, I did, didn’t I? [Laughs] Be careful what you wish for. But it was great to work with Maisie [Williams] again. I think it’s been a really well balanced and a deftly told story about two people who haven’t seen each other in a long time, who have changed a hell of a lot in those intervening years, being reunited and rediscovering each other. And then also having to go through the most kind of arduous experience in Episode 3, and what that does to your psyche. What did you think about the audience reaction to Gendry and Arya’s love scene before the battle? What was your take on it when you first discovered it was in the works? When I first read it, I was slightly cautious about it, because I’ve known Maisie since she was 11 or 12 years old. And so it was always going to be a slightly strange thing, to try to wrap your head around knowing you would be imminently shooting a scene like that with someone you’ve known since they were so young. By the same token, Maisie was 21, she’s 22 years old now. She’s a grown woman and a fantastic actor, so we were just completely professional about it. The scene itself was kind of fun — we made sure to keep the mood light. For my experience, it was not an arduous scene to shoot, and I hope Maisie felt the same way about it. I hope she felt the atmosphere was familiar and supportive and safe. The reality is, though, she doesn’t need me to look after her. She’s spent way more time on that set than I have over the years. The level of respect she has from everyone is sky high, and I think everything was done the way she wanted it. It’s an interesting conversation that started around it, though, with the audience discomfort. The conversation kind of forces you to confront some hypocrisy. I was 11 once, and then I got older, and then I started having sex, and that’s absolutely fine. That’s part of my expected journey through life. We all go through it. We all sort of bristle when we feel patronized about it, when someone suggests we’re too young to be doing something. But when it’s somebody else, we find it uncomfortable to watch. When the Arya/Gendry shipping first started in Season 2, it had another layer to it because she was a minor at the time. She’s an adult now. Yeah, exactly. That was the reality of that situation. I did a show called “Skins” a number of years ago, and my character Chris was naked, taking drugs, having sex with his teacher, and no one batted an eyelid. I think I was about a year or two younger than Maisie was, when I was shooting this? The difference is, the audience didn’t watch me grow up onscreen. It wasn’t like I played this character from the age of 11 or 12, and all of a sudden I was 19 and doing all of this incredibly adult stuff. When Maisie was a minor, and I was an adult, it seemed completely ludicrous to expect me to have an opinion on Arya/Gendry shipping other than, “Well, it’s never going to happen. It’s not possible.” And I was forced to confront my own initial discomfort this time around. O.K., now it’s technically possible — let’s not be patronizing to Maisie. Some people were saying, “Oh, they should never have asked Maisie to do that.” But why? If I was a new actor to the show, playing a new character who was 31, and Maisie was 21, then it wouldn’t be a thing. It’s just because I’ve been on the show for so long, and I’ve known her for all this time that it becomes slightly odd. And I understand that. I understand people being uncomfortable watching someone they’ve feel they’ve seen grow up onscreen take part in things like that. I get it. But once you confront it rationally, I don’t see how you can have much of a problem with it. And it’s important to guard against that concern spilling over into a form of prudishness that actually risks removing the agency from a fully grown adult, you know what I mean? Afterward they have completely different reactions — Gendry fell asleep and Arya didn’t seem thrilled. So much of Gendry’s story has been so incredibly meme-able over the course of eight seasons, and that shot was certainly one of them! [Laughs.] Afterward, possibly it’s the realization that she’s not, at least not now, capable of that kind of love, because of what she’s been through. While Gendry obviously had a great time and is just getting some sleep! [Laughs.] It’s a very common scenario. And yet, his next move is to propose. The amount that all of these characters are having to process … They just survived this huge battle with death itself, and the elation that must come from that, and the grief for those who were lost, and the trauma of that experience. And for Gendry, to be legitimized, it’s allowed him to anchor himself. He just felt, “My god, my life is finally coming together!” I think his life was fairly lonely before, and he probably thought, now that I’m a Lord, I need a Lady. He is very attracted to the woman that Arya’s become, but all the things that he likes about her are the things that will make her never be with him that way. Do you think he loves her? I think in that moment, he thinks he loves her. If this is our goodbye to Gendry, is he going to be O.K.? Gendry’s hurt, but he doesn’t have to think about it for too long to realize that Arya’s absolutely right. He got a bit carried away. He just let his mind and his heart race away a little bit. If he sits down for half an hour and thinks about it, he’ll understand. It’s not going to be something he’s hung up on for too long.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: The Night King Speaks,"This article contains spoilers for Season 8, Episode 3 of “Game of Thrones.” The Night King was a terrifying figure. He could raise the dead. He had strange, devilish horns on his head. But a lot of the fear he inspired came simply from what we didn’t know about him. He didn’t speak, save in the form of horrific corpse-art installations that were rather hard to decipher. Only very late in the “Game of Thrones” arc did we finally learn that his purpose was to bring about an endless night and to erase humanity’s biggest memory download, the Three-Eyed Raven. Still, he took his sweet time in approaching Bran Stark in Sunday’s episode, making some fans wonder why. Vladimir Furdik, the Slovakian actor and stuntman who played the Night King, called from Budapest to share what it was like shooting the Battle of Winterfell. Following are edited excerpts from that conversation. [Read our recap of Season 8, Episode 3 of “Game of Thrones.”] What did you think when you finally got to see the finished versions of your pivotal scenes? The Night King’s confrontation with Dany, with Arya … I was actually on set all day, every day. I did every part of the battle because I was helping choreograph the fights from beginning to end, every kill. I wasn’t just Night King, you know? Everything that happens in this episode, I was close behind the camera or the sound man to help them. And then when you see someone in the monitor, you can say to the director, “[Miguel Sapochnik], have them put their head down!” When I saw it on the TV, I said, “Wow, this is amazing.” Especially the end, with the music and the slow motion — it took my heart, you know? I was like, I feel cold. Have you seen any of the fan reaction? No, no, no, no, no. I would like to. There are a lot of fun ones out there. For instance, Jimmy Kimmel did a bit about how he thought the Night King and Bran had some very interesting romantic chemistry. Whoa! There was a long moment where the Night King and Bran gaze at each other. People were wondering what was going on between them. Ah! That moment, that was very different because [Isaac Hempstead Wright] and I are very good friends. And we were joking many times, you know? And I remember a couple times when they said, “Action!” he gave me a look, and he smiled! He smiled through his eyes! And I tried to hold it back. I said to myself, “Don’t smile, don’t smile.” And then I said to Isaac, “Please don’t smile because then I’ll smile!” And mess up on camera! We were worried about laughing! I remember there was rain, and so a couple of times I held my umbrella over him. And he said, “Somebody should take a picture of you holding the umbrella.” He posted that on Instagram: “Here’s a still taken from the alternate Episode 3 ending in which the Night King becomes Bran’s carer and they both live happily ever after.” [Laughs.] So what was it like shooting your death scene? Every time they killed me — it will be in my brain forever, you know? This was a very hard shooting day, I remember. It really wasn’t easy for me and for [Maisie Williams], to just sell the moment, you know? And it was cold. It was raining. She was on the wire, in a harness, and she did the jump many times. She was so tired. When I turn, to grab her, this was also difficult for me to grab her at exactly the moment she’s jumping. When I hold her under the jaw, and we look at each other, I could feel she was full of emotion. I can tell you, it was a strong moment between me and her. Not just because we did it so many times. But there was something on the set, when they said, “Action!” and I grab her and we look at each other. It was so strong. I cannot tell you how strong. Was there ever anything about the Night King that confused you? Or that you wanted more information about? I think that what [the showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss] did was very clear, so I completely understood what they wanted. I think maybe at the beginning of the season, they might have thought he would fight more with his sword, but everything from David and Dan was clear. I mean more of the Night King mythology or story? Like, where did he leave the baby White Walkers during the battle? What was it like to raise them? Did you ever imagine more about his life? No, not really. I wasn’t thinking about this. I think if somebody would like to tell a story about what happened — what happened after he changed the babies to be White Walkers — we can shoot another episode about this stuff!",The New York Times
2019,"‘Godzilla: King of the Monsters’ Review: For Once, the Title Says It All","Ghidorah, Mothra and even Kong make appearances in this film, which is firmly in franchise territory. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The beloved movie monster Godzilla both goes big and goes home in this sequel to the 2014 “Godzilla.” For those of you who haven’t been keeping your scorecards updated, that movie was a reboot of a reboot, the uninspiring “Godzilla” of 1998. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is franchise fodder, however. The series is being steered to encompass a battle between Godzilla and King Kong, like the one the Japanese Big G films from the ’60s once enacted. The sort-of sideways tie-in here is with “Kong: Skull Island” from 2017. While Kong himself appears here in but a glimpse, his home gets a lot of mentions. In this incarnation, a family torn apart by Godzilla takes the foreground. Science people Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga use their daughter Millie Bobby Brown as an emotional Ping-Pong ball while government agencies and eco-terrorists contend with the awakening of a fearsome three-headed beast named Monster Zero. It’s rather beside the point to note plot goofiness in a Godzilla picture, but this one does push its luck now and then. At one point it seems the film could go full “Kramer vs. Kramer” with Godzilla and Monster Zero (a.k.a. Ghidorah) as attorneys for the parental plaintiffs. This movie is often pretty slack in matters of story construction and direction. (The responsibility for the latter lies with Michael Dougherty.) Spatial relations are superlax, with characters and heavily armed forces showing up here, there and everywhere from out of nowhere. As in the 2014 film, this Godzilla is a stouter fellow than we have seen in previous incarnations. While underwater, he resembles a giant electric eel with bourbon bloat. But he gets the wreaking-international-havoc job done, as do the many other monsters, including a Mothra almost as delightfully psychedelic as the old Toho version. Godzilla: King of the Monsters Rated PG-13 for fiery monster breath, mass destruction, teen custody battle trauma. Running time: 2 hours 11 minutes.

2019,‘Good Omens’ Unites an Angel and a Demon for Judgment Day,"LONDON — On a cold, damp day in December 2017, angels and demons were abroad in a sprawling South London park. The Archangel Gabriel jogged in a light gray tracksuit and two lesser mystical beings argued in a Victorian bandstand. “Great pustulant mangled bollocks to the Great blasted Plan,” yelled a demon called Crowley. An angel called Aziraphale looked suitably shocked. The schoolboys playing soccer nearby didn’t notice this earthly host and the passing dog-walkers ignored them. But in the video village a few yards away, a fleece-jacketed film crew saw what they had made, and, behold, it was good. To be precise, it was “Good Omens.” Unlike Creation, however, this television adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s novel, debuting Friday on Amazon Prime Video, wasn’t finished in six days. It took nearly 30 years of misfires, false starts and tragedy, including Pratchett’s death in 2015, for “Good Omens” to reach the screen. The upside is that this fantastical six-part adaptation, which stars Michael Sheen (“Masters of Sex”) as Aziraphale and David Tennant (“Doctor Who,” “Gracepoint”) as Crowley, with Jon Hamm guest-starring as Gabriel, is arriving at a time in which television’s ambition has caught up with that of the story. Either God moves in mysterious ways, or the gods that govern television do. “What we’ve got is a great big sprawling six-part movie with 300 different characters, and every scene is in a different place,” Tennant said in his trailer, after filming Crowley’s outburst. “Even if it’s just Michael and I talking on a park bench, we’re on a park bench surrounded by Victorian dinosaurs.” The novel, which debuted in 1990, is in the vein of Douglas Adams’s “The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,” except that instead of riffing on science-fiction tropes, it pokes geeky fun at “The Omen” and the Book of Revelation. “Good Omens” establishes that Aziraphale and Crowley have been on Earth for millenniums, luring its inhabitants toward salvation and damnation, respectively. Now, though, their time is almost up. A war between Heaven and Hell is brewing; Judgment Day is just a week away. But like a pair of John le Carré undercover agents who have grown too comfortable in their assumed identities, the angel and the demon realize that they quite enjoy living with the human race, so they team up to find the Antichrist and postpone the end of days. The author pairing was equally auspicious. Gaiman has written beloved fantasy stories in just about every medium there is, including comics (“Sandman”), novels (“American Gods,” “Coraline”), children’s books (“The Wolves in The Wall”) and screenplays (“Beowulf”). Pratchett wrote the best-selling “Discworld” series of Tolkienesque comic novels. Sure enough, “Good Omens” earned rave reviews across the board — almost. More than 27 years later in Battersea Park, Gaiman can still quote from memory Joe Queenan’s review in The New York Times, which argued that “Good Omens” was more than unfunny — it was proof that the British are intrinsically humorless. Readers disagreed. “When we wrote the book, all the trouble was happening with ‘The Satanic Verses,’” Gaiman remembered, referring to the Salman Rushdie novel that prompted Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini to call for the author’s murder, sending him into hiding. “Terry did wonder whether we would have to find out if Salman Rushdie had a back bedroom.” “But in fact,” he added, “what we got was an enormous amount of love.” A film was the obvious next step. Or so it seemed. Gaiman and Pratchett quickly drafted a screenplay, but neither was happy with it. A decade later, Terry Gilliam, the director of “Brazil” and “12 Monkeys,” had a crack at it. He cast Johnny Depp as Crowley and Robin Williams as Aziraphale, and flew to Hollywood to find a distributor in early 2002. “But it was post-9/11,” Gaiman said. “No one was interested in an apocalyptic comedy.” Another decade later, Terry Jones announced that he would shepherd “Good Omens” onto television, thus making it the only novel to have had two members of Monty Python (and three people named Terry) play key parts in developing its screen adaptation. But when Jones’s iteration fell through, it was left to the original Terry — Pratchett — to ensure that a TV series would go ahead. But in 2007, he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. By 2014, the condition he called “the Embuggerance” was so severe that he sent Gaiman a letter. “We’d been friends for 35 years,” Gaiman said, his voice thickening. “He said: ‘I’ve never asked you anything before, and we’ve always agreed that with anything related to “Good Omens” we either do it together or we don’t do it. But you have to do this. No one else can do it. I know how busy you are, but I want to see this before I can’t see anything.’” “So I had to do it,” he said. Pratchett died in 2015, a week before Gaiman planned to begin writing. “So I started in a not-funny frame of mind,” he said. Nonetheless, he completed the scripts for a six-part series. They included a nuclear power plant, the Garden of Eden and the lost city of Atlantis. The plot spanned the globe and encompassed the whole of human history. The cast of characters included Shakespeare, Satan and the Four Horsemen (or rather, Motorcyclists) of the Apocalypse. In other words, there was no way that Britain’s state broadcaster, the BBC, could afford to produce it. But, lo, a miracle occurred. In 2016, a new law allowed the BBC to collaborate with commercial competitors for the first time, enabling Amazon to cover 70 percent of the “Good Omens” budget. Gaiman saw this partnership as being almost as unlikely as Crowley and Aziraphale’s. “On the one hand, you have a Kafka-esque organization” like the BBC, he said, “and on the other you have the Wild West” of Amazon, he said. “And they have to learn to play well together.” Whatever your views on divine providence, it could be for the best that the adaptation comes at a time when television series can be as expensively spectacular as Hollywood blockbusters, while also being several hours longer. “I think in deciding to adapt this book, there had to be the opportunity to give it the scale and the scope that it has,” Tennant said. “There would have been no point in telling this story without that opportunity.” Such scale and attention to detail will no doubt delight fans of the sprawling, fanciful novel, especially after 30 years of waiting for it to reach the screen. “People who love the book love it with a passion,” Tennant said. “It’s our responsibility not to mess it up.” This responsibility goes beyond just doing right by the novel’s fans, he added. “There is a real sense that Neil is keen to honor Terry’s memory.” Outside in chilly Battersea Park, Gaiman concurred. The uproarious tale of the friendship between an angel and a demon is being televised at last, he stressed, because of the friendship between two writers. “Terry Pratchett asked me to do it,” he said. “And I did.” An earlier version of this article misstated the title of a movie directed by Terry Gilliam. It is “12 Monkeys,” not “13 Monkeys.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Grace Will Lead Us Home,’ an Intimate Look at Forgiveness, Anger and Trauma After the Charleston Massacre","Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In her classic essay on evil, Simone Weil differentiates between evil as we imagine it (“romantic and varied”) and as it exists (“monotonous, barren”). It is goodness, she argues, that is truly glamorous. It is goodness that possesses the capacity to shock us; goodness alone that is always “new, marvelous, intoxicating.” It has been four years since Dylann Roof walked into a Bible study group at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., and killed nine people, including the pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, in a hail of more than 70 bullets. “I have to do this,” Roof said to the group at one point. “Y’all raping all our white women and taking over the nation.” The oldest of Roof’s victims was 87-year-old Susie Jackson; the youngest was Jackson’s 26-year-old grandnephew, Tywanza Sanders, who reached out to touch her curly hair as they lay dying. Tywanza’s mother, Felicia Sanders, survived by rubbing her body in her son’s blood and playing dead. President Obama was in his Marine One helicopter, formulating a public statement about the tragedy and the recent spate of mass shootings — there had been 23 in the five years of his presidency — when the news broke that family members of the victims had publicly forgiven Roof. “Hold off on the statistics,” Obama told his staffers. “That’s what I want to put the spotlight on.” A monstrous act of terrorism became a transfixing narrative of grace and forgiveness. Roof — as banal as Simone Weil predicted, with his garbled ambition for sparking a race war — was eclipsed by his victims, the richness of their lives, the dignity and spiritual power of their families. Spotlights, of course, reveal by concealing. In “Grace Will Lead Us Home,” Jennifer Berry Hawes, a Polk Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, offers a fuller, more complicated picture of the massacre and its aftermath. A reporter for the Charleston-based Post and Courier (her children attended the school across the street from the church), she covered the tragedy extensively, and drew on her long relationships with the families in writing this book. “They weren’t the homogeneous group of forgiving people the world wanted them to be,” she writes. During sentencing, “some screamed at Roof, calling him evil. Several hoped he burned in hell for eternity. They called him a coward. Satan. An animal. A monster.” The narrative of forgiveness was alluring, in part, because it seemed to so quickly suture the wound; if the families had forgiven Roof, what need for self-examination or substantive change? White residents of Charleston held that tensions had actually lessened in their city; they were twice as likely as their black counterparts to say that race relations had improved as a direct result of the mass murder. Hawes is a poised writer and a patient observer who trains her focus on the present. She gestures briefly to Charleston’s role as the epicenter of the nation’s slave trade (“as the Civil War approached almost three in four white families here had owned slaves”) and the long history of attacks on black churches, including Emanuel, which was first burned to the ground in 1822. Her primary interest is in the lives of the survivors and the families of the victims, “the people who will live this story forever.” For most, trauma begat trauma: health problems, even sudden deaths. One widower lost 60 pounds and became unable to return to work. Bitter divisions flared. Eleven months after the shooting, Sharon Risher and Nadine Collier, two daughters of Ethel Lance, one of Roof’s victims, couldn’t even agree on a headstone for their mother. When Risher finally had one erected over the grave, Collier installed her own version directly in front of it. At one point, according to the author, Risher felt it was more likely that she might forgive Dylann Roof than her sister. Even those who fought to return to some semblance of normalcy found that their lives had become uncomfortably public. Private people felt forced into activism and advocacy even as the shootings had left them adrift — and they felt spiritually abandoned by their church (which itself became mired in controversy after donations went missing). Roof remains a shadowy figure in the narrative (see the journalist and critic Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah’s Pulitzer Prize-winning profile for a more detailed look at his life and radicalization). He is not even named at first, referred to only as “a young white man, lean of frame.” Hawes takes an obsessive interest in his size and fragility, in fact; he is “a slim white man,” a “small man” who looked “so young and out of place” in the courtroom. There are countless references to his “scrawny” frame, his “slender hand” and “thin wrist.” It’s as if Hawes cannot reckon that monstrosity should present in such a package — and these sections want for self-scrutiny on her part, about which bodies might be automatically coded to her as harmless and innocent. Hawes says that she wanted to write as comprehensive an account as possible. She largely succeeds — if sacrificing, invariably, some depth for breadth. Still, she lands the book with moral force and great feeling, writing about the soil that could produce both the Emanuel Nine and a Dylann Roof.",The New York Times
2019,‘Halston’ Review: The Designer as Unsolved Mystery,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Sometimes a documentary doesn’t know when to leave well enough alone. It’s got access to all of the important people, who come through as their most maximal selves. It’s got a good story to tell and a life to unpack and tons of old photographs and miles of archival footage to delight, intrigue and astound. If you’ve got all of that and your documentary is called “Halston,” you don’t need anything else. And yet for reasons unfathomable to me, the people who made this movie don’t trust what they’ve got: the tale of one of the crucial fashion imaginations in Roy Halston Frowick, who went, titanically, by that middle name. They don’t trust the images and interviews animating this thing. They feel compelled to be smart or maybe just ponderously playful about it. So Frédéric Tcheng’s movie opens the way a Raymond Chandler novel might, with an insinuation of noir, except “Halston” starts in some kind of editing room, in which video players are swallowing cassettes and the actor and writer Tavi Gevinson has to do a lot of lurking and creaking as both the narrator and, what, a production-assistant private detective? Somebody erased Halston’s precious video archive, and the movie wants to finger the culprit. These early scenes are meant to conjure an air of 1980-something corporate ruthlessness and dour nostalgia (“It was morning again in America,” Gevinson says on two different occasions, from a script Tcheng wrote). But who cares about morning. Show me some evening gowns! “Halston” is a juicy business-culture story, not a film noir. It’s how about this ambitious, soap-opera handsome, emotionally opaque man went from Iowan to New Yorker, from serf at Bergdorf Goodman to Merlin of American fashion to shuttlecock in corporate-takeover badminton. He made “hot pants” a thing in the 1960s and Ultrasuede shirt dresses a thing in the ’70s. His innovation of crafting dresses from a single piece of fabric — cutting along the bias — was basically a biblical miracle. (Women were completely naked under their Halstons. The man had, we’re told, “hands of gold.” And the patterns looked “like a Cuisinart blade.”) A Halston fashion show was a theatrical event that included, with aberrant nonchalance for the times, black models. Liza Minnelli was — and remains — a true-blue bestie. Both the designer and the brand became essential to ideas of attire in the ’70s and early ’80s. (The company made uniforms for the Girl Scouts, the folks at Avis, and the American athletes of the ’76 Olympics; he cut a deal to glamorize the average woman for J.C. Penney, making him a granddaddy of the mass-market fashion collaboration.) Even through the Studio 54 era and the drug-assisted (or drug-induced) workaholism; even though, as the film rewinds to assert, Halston could be a tyrant, things were humming. But then big business — or rather really big business — entered in 1983 and had some concerns. The company’s new corporate parent, Esmark, scrutinized the budgets, and the exorbitant old days seemed doomed. The film details power struggles and ego trips and culture clashes. And the folks gathered here to do the enumerating — his assistants, his pals, one of his boyfriends, the models, the executives, his niece, a movingly protective Minnelli, the dude who erased the tapes — paint such a vivid picture of the atmosphere around Halston, the man and the industry, that you almost don’t mind that Halston himself remains elusive. That’s partly a matter of his indirect participation (he died in 1990, at 57, of AIDS) and because he was as grand a fortress as his buddy Andy Warhol. He’s the mystery the film is trying to solve but can’t. All of that stuff with Gevinson, whose years as a young fashion blogger entitle her to do more here than Tcheng’s droning, seems amateurishly literal. And that’s strange for Tcheng, who’s directed or co-directed good fashion films, about Diana Vreeland and Christian Dior. He’s reaching here. And yet I liked the deluge of visual information and personalities. The pictures, footage, biography, news and gossip are the opposite of a Halston dress — unruly, busy, fussed over. But they come at you with an energy that feels substantial. Knowing what to do with all of that material is its own kind of intelligence. Why overthink it? Or: why show us what you’ve overthought?

2019,‘Heartbroken’: Weinstein Accusers Say $44 Million Settlement Lets Him Off the Hook,"Two actresses who have sued the movie producer said they would not sign on, jeopardizing the proposed deal. Others expressed anger and disappointment. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Zoe Brock, a former model who has accused Harvey Weinstein of sexually inappropriate behavior, said she once viewed a lawsuit against him as her best opportunity to hold him to account. But on Friday, she said she was “heartbroken” to learn that negotiators were nearing a tentative agreement to pay $44 million to resolve lawsuits filed by women who said Mr. Weinstein sexually abused them, far less than the $90 million they had originally expected. Lawyers for the actress Wedil David expressed similar disgust, saying their client would scuttle the settlement because the compensation was too small for the accusers and too friendly to directors of the Weinstein Company. Kadian Noble, an actress who said Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted her and forced her to watch him masturbate in Cannes, France, said she would be grateful for any amount of compensation, though the money would not make the trauma go away. The potential resolution of the lawsuits against Mr. Weinstein had been anticipated by many of his accusers as a cathartic moment in the decades-long saga of the allegations against him, given that the criminal case against him involves only two women. But on Friday, at least two women involved in civil suits indicated they were so discouraged that they planned to block the whole agreement. The proposed amount to compensate victims is less than half of what was initially proposed during conversations last year between investors, who were interested in the Weinstein Company’s assets, and Eric T. Schneiderman, who was New York’s attorney general at the time. That proposal included a victims’ fund worth up to $90 million, but it fell apart at the last minute. Under the terms of the new proposal, about $30 million would go to a pool to pay the accusers, their lawyers, creditors of Mr. Weinstein’s former studio and some former employees, according to five people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the agreement was private. The remaining $14 million would cover legal fees for associates of Mr. Weinstein named as defendants in lawsuits, including the company’s board members, these people said. Insurance policies would cover the entire $44 million if the current agreement is finalized, they said. But the deal hinges on all of the plaintiffs agreeing to it. At least two, Ms. David and Alexandra Canosa, have rejected the proposal, according to the people close to the negotiations. The proposed deal would eliminate civil liability for Mr. Weinstein and the company’s board, except in one lawsuit brought by the actress Ashley Judd, which was never part of the settlement negotiations, another person familiar with the talks said. Under the tentative agreement, Mr. Weinstein would also give up his claim against insurers for the cost of his criminal defense. The company’s board members, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein, would have to pay 30 percent of their own legal fees, the person said. No additional payments would be required. “The proposed deal would provide millions of dollars to the ultra-wealthy directors of the Weinstein Company, such as James Dolan, and their big firm lawyers,” Ms. David’s lawyers, Douglas H. Wigdor and Kevin Mintzer, said in a statement on Friday. They added: “It would also allow Harvey Weinstein and the men who enabled him, including his brother, Robert Weinstein, to escape liability and accountability without, apparently, contributing a dime of their own money.” In court filings, Ms. David said Mr. Weinstein raped her in 2016 and masturbated in front of her in 2015 and 2016, including once during a meeting about a prospective acting job at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Canosa has also said the movie mogul raped her. Yet some people familiar with the settlement discussions said the proposal was the best possible deal in a scenario with few promising outcomes. Two people close to the negotiations said the pool of money for victims had grown in recent weeks, after plaintiffs rejected a previous plan that would have set aside only $25 million for them. The board of directors agreed to pay more of their own legal fees to increase the pool available to Mr. Weinstein’s accusers. The discussions began to heat up in March 2018, after the Weinstein Company, the Hollywood studio founded by Mr. Weinstein and his brother, filed for bankruptcy. At the time, the studio faced a mountain of debt and a swelling number of lawsuits, including one brought by the New York attorney general. The studio had less than $500,000 in cash at the time. Recent court rulings that absolved Mr. Weinstein’s brother and the board of directors of liability added pressure to reach an agreement, according to people familiar with the discussions. Those rulings meant the board members could seek reimbursement of legal fees, which would increase their share of the overall settlement. A special master, who would also be paid through the settlement, is expected to be assigned to the case and would determine how much some plaintiffs receive. The amount would vary depending on the claim. Those who allege Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them would receive more than those who say he harassed them. A lawyer for plaintiffs in the so-called class-action lawsuit, Elizabeth Fegan, would also receive a significant portion of the settlement. Ms. Fegan did not respond to requests for comment. Adam Harris, a lawyer for Bob Weinstein, said during a hearing on Thursday that the parties had reached a “good settlement” that the plaintiffs supported. Mr. Harris said the agreement would “provide significant compensation” to Mr. Weinstein’s accusers and his company’s creditors while avoiding years of “costly, time-consuming and uncertain litigation on all sides.” Lawyers for Mr. Weinstein’s accusers have been in mediation since last year with representatives for Mr. Weinstein, former board members and the New York attorney general’s office. Last year, the attorney general sued Mr. Weinstein and his brother for violating state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and coercion. The plan was to reach a settlement that would cover all of the suits pending against the former Hollywood mogul, his now-defunct movie studio and associates. The Weinstein Company is seeking to liquidate. In a recent bankruptcy filing, lawyers for the studio said the efforts to resolve legal claims by some of the women had stalled in recent months, and strained its limited resources. The talks were also described as “highly adversarial.” It has been a particularly difficult lift to get all of the plaintiffs onboard, and some of the women said they understood they risk getting less if settlement discussions continued, lawyers involved in the talks and some of the women have said. One woman who has accused Mr. Weinstein of sexually assaulting her, but asked not to be named because of the pending settlement discussions, said the deal was “nowhere near where a settlement should be.” “I think we could have done better on this,” she said. “It doesn’t hold individuals or corporations responsible for people who have been sexual predators for decades.” Ms. Brock said the $44 million was a relatively small amount given the fortune Mr. Weinstein and his studios had made over the years. “I feel like this is being forced on me because it’s probably either this or nothing,” Ms. Brock said in a phone interview. She added: “I wanted a judgment so big it would make companies quake in their boots before they ever considered harboring a predator again.” Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey contributed reporting. Susan C. Beachy contributed research. A previous version of the article misstated the accusations Zoe Brock brought against Harvey Weinstein. She accused him of sexually inappropriate behavior, not of sexual assault.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘Her Royal Highness and the Baby Are Both Doing Well’,"Harry and Meghan welcomed a baby boy at Frogmore Cottage. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Of all the stories about the British royal family, and they are legion, none beg to start “Once upon a time” quite as insistently as those about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. And now the storybook romance of a mixed-race American actress and her Prince Charming has added another irresistible plotline: the birth of a boy who is “absolutely to die for,” according to his dad, and who will live happily ever after in a home called Frogmore Cottage. The storyteller is free here to throw in that Queen Victoria, the unnamed lad’s 19th-century ancestor, had breakfast at the recently renovated 10-bedroom “cottage” near Windsor Castle and found the many frogs that gave the place its name “quite disgusting.” Evidently they were not all enchanted princes. But then there’s so much else to throw in the story that this detail should get squeezed out. Like the fact that not only is the newborn’s first name not yet known, but nor is his last name, or his title. The betting is on Arthur and James for the former, but they were also the favorites a year ago for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s (Prince William’s and Catherine’s) third child, and he became Louis. As for surname, his parents could choose Mountbatten-Windsor, which some members of the royal family use, or Sussex, since the parents are formally the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, or none, if his great-grandmum, Queen Elizabeth II, chooses to make him a prince, which is her royal prerogative. Oh, and there’s so much more! There are probably some cynics out there who are asking, as they do whenever the British royalty take over the news and social media, why should we care? But all that does is generate yet more stories, these about why we do care. The explanations range from the morality play of racism overcome in the birth of a boy descended from slaves and kings, or the undertones of racism in how the Harry-Meghan romance is depicted, and on to the simple need for escape from the tedious Brexit mess. There is what to reflect on in the entry of a descendant of plantation slaves into a royal caste whose members can account for every drop of blue blood in their veins. A central part of the fascination with Harry and Meghan is the decidedly modern dose of reality in every aspect of their story, from the wedding featuring a gospel choir, to her estranged father, Thomas Markle (who was quoted in The Sun saying he was sure his grandson would grow up to serve Britain “with grace, dignity and honor”), as well as the worthy causes they support and the charming way they hold hands in public. [The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] Preparing for the birth of their firstborn, they even tried to break the traditional way royal births are followed and proclaimed, seeking in this, as in the choice of their secluded home, to create a semblance of a private life. Of course, that unleashed a stormy debate over whether royalty are duty-bound to be on constant display. In any case, there was plenty of tradition to be had, including the framed notice on an easel outside Buckingham Palace announcing that the duchess “was safely delivered of a son at 0526am today.” “Her Royal Highness and the baby are both doing well,” the palace said in a further announcement. In the end, there’s really no need to try to explain why the birth of a baby boy to Harry and Meghan is so enthralling. Theirs is a real-life fable in which people of all backgrounds and colors can find echoes of their own lives, their childhood fantasies and dreams, all the while sharing Prince Harry’s timeless wonder at witnessing a birth: “It’s been the most amazing experience I could ever have possibly imagined. How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Opinion | ‘Here There Is Nothing’,"Guatemalans deserve better than Jimmy Morales’s lawlessness and Donald Trump’s posturing. Opinion Columnist VADO, N.M. — Rigoberto Pablo ran out of hope. There was no work, no decent schooling for his children. Nothing in the dried-out streams, wilting coffee plants and wafting sewage of his village in the western highlands of Guatemala gave him reason to think his family’s suffering would end. So late last year, he crossed the nearby Mexican border, U.S.A.-bound. Three months later, in February, I met him in this small New Mexico town, a timid man with a gentle smile. Pablo, age 37, is in American limbo, like hundreds of thousands of migrants. Seated on a sofa in the home of his hosts, he reached down, turned up the hem of his pants and revealed the electronic ankle monitor that Immigration and Customs Enforcement affixed when it released him. A green light confirmed he was being tracked. “If I take it off,” he said, “they’ll come after me.” His 14-year-old son, Alex, who crossed the border with his father on Nov. 14 and is now in seventh grade at a nearby school, gazed at the device. His dad, he said, is “not a rapist or murderer. He wants to work and I want to study.” If only it were that simple. Rigoberto and Alex Pablo are part of a vast influx. Already, the 460,294 migrants apprehended at the southern border this year outnumber those for all of 2018. Since October, 1 percent of Guatemala’s total population — more than 160,000 people — have crossed. Many are children. Almost a year after President Trump ended his cruel “zero tolerance” policy that ripped kids from their parents, children, most from Central America, are still pouring in — some 40,000 in April alone, almost 9,000 of them unaccompanied by a parent. Last month Juan de León Gutiérrez, 16 years old, became the third Guatemalan child to die in federal custody in five months. The others were 7 and 8. This situation is unconscionable. Americans of all political stripes should be able to agree on that. The United States has to reconcile being a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. Yet our immigration policy is mired in shameful congressional paralysis, with the great diversion of Trump’s sea-to-shining-sea wall serving only to fire up his base and fan political differences. His policy zigzags, and his revolving-door appointments and his threats (including the construction of a “contingency” detention center for migrants at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba) do nothing to address the root of the immigration crisis: the implosion of Central America. “This crisis is about children, their safety and the future of our region,” said Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, this month. Nothing he or Mark Morgan, Trump’s nominee to head ICE, does will work until the collapse of the region is addressed. Guatemala is led by a former TV star (sound familiar?) named Jimmy Morales, who ran in 2015 on a slogan of “Neither corrupt nor a thief.” That is now a joke. He has tried to expel the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, a United Nations-backed group. He wants to grant amnesty to the perpetrators of the 1980s genocide that killed hundreds of thousands of Guatemalans, most of them indigenous people like the Pablo family. Meanwhile the state is failing to provide its people with basic food, health care, education and protection from narco-violence. Trump says he wants to punish Guatemala and its neighbors for not doing enough to stop the migrants. “No money goes there anymore,” he said. But he has winked at Morales’s corruption, emboldening him to trash the rule of law that is Guatemalans’ only defense. State Department officers seethe at America’s abandonment of its values, but political appointees overrule them. Morales keeps Trump happy in various ways. Guatemala moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem immediately after the United States did. No wonder people like Pablo are fleeing. He is planning to petition for asylum, though gaining it will prove difficult; poverty alone isn’t a justification. Nonetheless, the backlog in immigration court means he’ll probably be able to remain for two to three years before his case is heard. In the meantime, he can’t legally work. He’s living with Aurelio and Maria Aranda, a family he met through the El Paso-based Border Network for Human Rights. His son is learning English, at least. Migrants bring children because it improves their chances of getting in, but also out of a fervid desire to give them a future. Pablo told me about the hunger and fear on the weeklong road to the border. Meager rice and beans offered once a day. Being herded this way and that by coyotes — the smugglers he’d paid $5,000 in borrowed money. Running under a full moon, climbing eight-foot wire fences, passing babies beneath them and children over them, surrendering in the dawn to the United States Border Patrol. He has no idea what will happen now. “My wife and three other children are back in the village,” Pablo told me. “I miss them. My youngest son was sick. I could not afford the medicine.” The candor of his gaze was almost unbearable. I decided I had to go to his village of Aldea Las Guacamayas to see for myself what had propelled him northward. It takes over nine hours to drive the roughly 220 miles from Guatemala City northwest to Pablo’s home. Volcanic mountains soar, dense with vegetation, browned from lack of rain. Neglect is everywhere: Subsiding hillside terraces are barren of cultivation, half-finished houses point rebar at the sky, unkempt shrines commemorate lives tipped over a precipice. Straight-backed indigenous women in bright fabric bestride this wounded landscape. Guatemala is a beautiful, traumatized country, marked by centuries of white Criollo racism toward the Mayans and other indigenous people. During the early 1980s, military-backed death squads rampaged through entire communities, justifying a scorched-earth policy on the spurious principle that “indigenous villages were the rivers in which the leftist guerrillas swam,” as Edgar Gutiérrez, a former foreign minister, put it to me. Leftist Sandinistas had triumphed in Nicaragua. The United States, determined to prevent this from happening in Guatemala, supported the paramilitary marauders. Some 200,000 people were killed, including 40,000 who disappeared. This was the Guatemalan genocide, an indelible wound. President Morales has encouraged the slogan “There was no genocide” — a tip of the hat to the military who support him. That Trump has embraced this government, given the past American military support that President Bill Clinton acknowledged as a “mistake,” underscores this administration’s contempt for human rights. Pablo’s wife, Candelaria Sales Garcia, greeted me outside the family’s hillside shack, where a duck pecked at a watermelon rind and a little dog called Dollar slept in the shade. In the kitchen, a wood fire heated beans in blackened pots. Sales is a woman with a broad smile that can’t quite mask her obvious pain. Her husband and one son are gone to North America. Another son, 19-year-old Valdomero, struggles to find work. Her daughter, Gabriela, 12, sits idle because her schoolteachers are no-shows. Her youngest, an 8-year-old named Leo, has a cheek swollen from an intractable infection. “I said nothing to my husband although he was leaving me behind here,” she told me. “Because I knew that there is nothing here.” Nothing. I kept hearing the word. Nothing from the government, nothing to do — no water, no education, no health care, no jobs — “here there is nothing, nothing,” Valdomero declared, sweeping a hand across the sunbaked landscape. The state hardly bothers to collect taxes — they represent a smaller percentage of gross national product than remittances — and does little with them. Listening to this bright, bilingual young man (he and his family speak the Mam dialect and Spanish), knowing that their brown skins make them invisible to their government, I was reminded of my South African father’s summation of why he could not stand apartheid and left: “The waste.” Valdomero does the work his father used to do. He unloads concrete building blocks from trucks. He stacks them. For a day of this, he says, he is paid about $8: Hardly enough to keep the family in tortillas. You do this and do this and do this — and then one day, you have to get out. As dusk fell, the young man suggested we take a walk up the mountain. It has changed since he was a child. The streams where he played and drank are gone. The birds are gone. So are the coffee trees. The mountainous amphitheater, visible from a ridge, is no longer verdant. For three or four years now, it has been dry and hot. I have never been anywhere that conveyed such a palpable sense of the earth dying. President Trump thinks climate change is a joke. He should come here. He would understand another big migration driver. The only sign of development is a couple of spindly red-and-white telecommunication towers on the ridges. A basic phone is cheap, and Guatemalans pay as they go: the 21st century’s bread and circuses for the masses. The next morning, I drove into Mexico with Valdomero. White posts with an official stamp mark the frontier, but there is no control of any kind: no police, no customs or border agents, no barrier, nothing. A Toyota Hilux roared up from the Mexican side but its driver, seeing a gringo, spun around. “Narcos,” Valdomero said. We continued some 15 miles into Mexico without being asked for a passport or papers. Coffee, gasoline, corn, chickens and coffee are openly smuggled back and forth on that road. So are people and drugs, mainly cocaine. Only a tiny fraction of the estimated 1,400 tons of cocaine transiting the country annually is interdicted. Congressmen, mayors and police officers have been paid off by the cartels. Morales will soon be term-limited out; for the presidential election next month, his party has put forward a new candidate, Estuardo Galdámez, who recently posed for a photograph with a convicted drug trafficker. Guatemala is sliding backward at an alarming rate. The passage from national trauma toward democratic decency is never easy. Here it began with the peace accords of 1996. For a dozen years now, democracy has been buttressed by the efforts of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or Cicig, established through a treaty between the United Nations and Guatemala. Cicig is central to Guatemala’s efforts to establish an independent justice system. Morales’s two predecessors were jailed on charges of corruption. The United States last month arrested and charged Mario Estrada, a presidential candidate close to Morales, with conspiracy to import cocaine. Morales himself is being investigated in Guatemala for campaign finance irregularities, and his brother and son face fraud charges. Some of the country’s richest families are being investigated for the illegal financing of Morales’s political party. Now President Morales has turned on Cicig, ordering its expulsion and unilaterally terminating its mission. He has banned Iván Velásquez, its head and a former Colombian prosecutor, from re-entering the country — all to scarcely a whimper from a Trump administration notoriously hostile to the United Nations and multilateralism. Guatemala’s Constitutional Court has ruled Morales’s measures illegal. The president has said its judgment means nothing: So much for the rule of law. Cicig continues its work, with Velásquez leading it from abroad, but stripped of any police protection for its personnel, the organization is “in intensive care,” as one American official put it to me. When I visited its headquarters in Guatemala City, a ghostly air prevailed. American support for Cicig had been critical. In 2013, Stephen Rapp, the State Department’s ambassador at large for war crimes, visited the courtroom where Efraín Ríos Montt, the former dictator, was tried. Montt was convicted through the bravery of survivors and Cicig-backed prosecutors, though the verdict was later vacated on a technicality. The message could not have been clearer: The United States is resolute in its support of an independent judicial process and Guatemala’s nascent rule of law. No longer. Trump’s America has gone AWOL. “Cicig has mounted a system of terror where it persecutes those who think differently,” Morales declared grotesquely to the United Nations General Assembly last September. Earlier that month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had tweeted, “We greatly appreciate Guatemala’s efforts in counternarcotics and security.” That was it. The State Department, through its deputy spokesman but not Pompeo himself, has declared that the United States is “deeply concerned” by Morales’s recent efforts to pass a bill that would grant amnesty to, and free, those convicted of gross human rights violations during Guatemala’s 36-year civil war. But this mild protest was dismissed in Guatemala City as the murmurings of a third-tier bureaucrat — in effect, tacit authorization. The government operates on the basis that it has a green light from the White House. Many in the State Department are troubled. One officer told me: “It’s a strange and disturbing thing. The arguments we make to political appointees are not heard. We have a State Department that basically stood by while Jimmy Morales dismantled the mechanisms put in place to confront impunity.” Luis Arreaga, the United States ambassador in Guatemala, is a career diplomat who has tried to stand up for American principles. For this he has been dismissed in local media as an Obama holdover, called the “worst ambassador in the world” and accused of being both on George Soros’s payroll (of course) and an agent of Cuba or Venezuela. All this is consistent with an elaborate Guatemalan lobbying operation in Washington that has sought to portray Cicig as a bunch of Soros-backed liberal lefties. Several Republicans, including Representative Rick Crawford of Arkansas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, have proved receptive. In January, Crawford tweeted in support of the expulsion of Cicig, saying Guatemalans were “entitled to their own sovereignty.” In March, Lee tweeted: “Free and fair elections of a nation’s representatives, chosen by and for the people, is the foundation of republican government. Our friends in Guatemala should be able to exercise this right, free from foreign influence by the U.S. State Department.” This amounted to a thinly veiled attack on Arreaga, whom Guatemalan media have attempted to portray as backing the presidential candidacy of Thelma Aldana, a tough former attorney general behind several anti-corruption cases. She now faces an arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement as Morales maneuvers desperately to block her candidacy. She has taken refuge in El Salvador. In line with the nationalist playbook at work in Hungary and Poland, Morales has also gone after the independent judiciary relentlessly. Judges are regularly branded as “terrorists.” I went to see Gloria Porras, one of the five justices on the Constitutional Court, Guatemala’s last bastion of the rule of law. She is a woman of great poise and dignity, under constant attack. “Every time we uphold a case of corruption,” she told me, we make it possible for “public money to be spent on the basic problems we have.” The government says that public money is not sufficient for medicine, education and roads. “I believe it is sufficient but not used in the right way,” she said. Porras and other colleagues have been threatened with removal from the court. This month there was a bomb threat that forced the court’s evacuation. She looked at me with defiant pride. “They assault my dignity,” she said, “because I have zero tolerance for narcotics trafficking and I am independent in my positions. The traffic of drugs to the United States is, as musicians say, in crescendo. The traffic is tied to corruption. Whatever the risks, whatever the attacks, I will do my work. It is a question of legality. It is also a question of honor.” “Every time I make the right decision,” she continued, “I contribute to the creation of hope that my country can change.” Every anti-corruption decision by an independent justice, in other words, fosters a Guatemala where Pablo and his family do not have to leave in desperation, because they might just have a future. Before I left Rigoberto Pablo’s village, I spoke to his daughter, Gabriela. School had been canceled. She was bored and frustrated. “I want to go to America, I want to study there with my brother,” she said. “And I want to see Papa.” No wall will stop the flow of migrants. No raging about rapists or threats to separate families will stop it. No racism against brown people or fear of demographic change in 21st-century America will stop it. A broken American immigration system certainly won’t stop it. Not as long as Central Americans are desperate. Trump doesn’t believe in multilateral diplomacy. If he were serious, he would involve Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico in diplomacy on practical steps. He would explore fair and efficient in-country asylum processing. He would stop talking about a wall and slashing foreign aid and start talking about Central American development, a possible Marshall Plan for the region. Mexican migration has declined as Mexican standards of living have risen. There’s a lesson there, if Trump were interested. He would pursue ways to make the Guatemalan-Mexican border something more than a joke, to combat corruption and narcotics trafficking, to fight impunity and establish the rule of law in Central America, to give Guatemalans some belief in their government, to empower the likes of Gloria Porras, to restore American values, to protect human rights and to match migrants with jobs. And he would declare, “We cannot tolerate the death on our watch of ONE MORE child!” The unique energy of America’s churn is indivisible from the renewal new immigrants bring. At the same time, if generosity breeds lawlessness, it defeats itself. Somewhere between those truths lie possible compromises on immigration that Republicans and Democrats could agree on — if Trump had not reduced politics to partisan war. My journey to the border and on to Guatemala left me with a familiar feeling: Trump’s America is betraying itself. What brought Rigoberto Pablo and his child here is an old and honorable idea of the United States: “I came to this country to make money and to improve my life,” he told me when we spoke this month. His ankle bracelet had been removed a few weeks before, and in August he will appear in court to apply for asylum. He is a decent, honest man with a decent, honest family. He deserves better than Jimmy Morales’s lawlessness and Donald Trump’s posturing. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘Hesburgh’ Review: A Portrait of a Heroic and Scandal-Free Catholic Priest,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. If you’re Catholic, and have an aunt or other relative who’s expressed agitation that pretty much every movie in which the Church figures nowadays focuses on a scandal, “Hesburgh” may do your relative a world of good. The documentary about the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, who was president of the University of Notre Dame for 35 years, is a portrait of a man who can be seen as not merely blameless, but genuinely heroic. Buttressed by narration culled from the priest’s own reminiscences (read by Maurice LaMarche), the movie, directed by Patrick Creadon, is most impressive in recounting Hesburgh’s tireless work, from the 1950s to the ’70s, on the United States Commission on Civil Rights. This commission, among other things, laid the groundwork for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This movie is also, in many respects, what the kids used to call “square.” It puts the Beach Boys’ kitsch classic “Student Demonstration Time” on the soundtrack during a section on campus unrest, for instance. (Hesburgh took a relatively hard line against protests at Notre Dame in the late ’60s even as he opposed the expansion of the Vietnam War and continued his civil rights work.) But “Hesburgh” is consistently smart about its subject. It makes a convincing case that the priest was one of a handful of whites in the civil rights movement who understood the systemic nature of racism in the United States. “It’s like holding a man underwater and saying why don’t you swim,” he said, in words that should continue to be heeded today.

2019,‘Hotbox’ Is the ‘Kitchen Confidential’ of the Big-Ticket Catering World,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. HOTBOX Inside Catering, the Food World’s Riskiest Business By Matt Lee and Ted Lee James Beard, Martha Stewart, Ina Garten, Giada De Laurentiis, Carla Hall: Where were they before they became masters of the food universe? They were catering. If this is news to you, it’s not your fault. While restaurants and the life and times of the chefs who headline them have become a fixed, glamorized point of cultural interest, catering, as the chef Gabrielle Hamilton wrote in her memoir “Blood, Bones & Butter,” has been stigmatized as “the most unsavory corner of the food industry, except for maybe poultry processing.” Yes, before opening her restaurant, Prune, and becoming a best-selling author, she too worked in catering. Hamilton is one of few people to write about this; it’s a subject food media like to pretend doesn’t exist. A few years later, a self-proclaimed “punk-rock caterer” known simply as Rossi published “The Raging Skillet,” which shares its title with her Lower East Side-based operation. Up until now, these memoirs might very well have been the only options for anyone curious about how those pigs-in-a-blanket wind up on cocktail trays or where those plates of beef tenderloin, a staple of weddings and charity galas, actually get cooked. But after clocking what seem like countless — and sometimes, endless — shifts behind the “pipe and drape” (trade jargon for the black curtain separating the army of unseen staff from the action and the guests enjoying it) of the highest end of New York City’s catering scene, Matt and Ted Lee, the fraternal food writers and cookbook authors from Charleston, S.C., have chronicled their experiences slicing ham in prep kitchens, riding on transport vans, placing tiny tufts of microgreens on top of lamb shanks at plating stations and frying beignets to order for overfed guests. In “Hotbox,” their report from the world of big-ticket catering, they write, “Event caterers aren’t just chefs; they’re haulers and builders, too, since they’re not only transporting the food to a remote spot, but also fashioning a kitchen out of thin air (oftentimes on sites as blank as a grass field or cement loading dock), and there’s rarely ever running water.” Once they’ve completed the prep work and moved the goods to the designated offsite location, the real fun begins: In kitchens that are “as makeshift as a school bake sale,” caterers conjure four-course meals for throngs of diners. ”Hotbox” is also an overview of the history of modern catering, centered on the book’s namesake box, a piece of equipment used for transporting food and cooking it — or, in Hamilton’s words, the “Sterno-fueled proofing cabinets that we’ve dubbed ‘the wall of fire.’ ” The chapters on that history are where the brothers shine, because they focus on the human parties responsible for shaping the industry as opposed to the parties themselves. It’s when the narrative gets into the technicalities that readers may get bogged down. [ Ted Lee says that he and his brother decided to write about the world of catering because “we were at a pivot point,” adding, “How much more does the world need to hear from two white guys who grew up in Charleston in the 1980s about how they cook?” ] The good news is that this provides a visceral sense of the minutiae K.A.s (kitchen assistants) deal with and how repetitive the work is; the bad news is that you’re reading about minutiae and repetition. Ironically, this has a somewhat dissociating effect. Throughout the book, the Lees emphasize the impersonal nature of preparing food for a client — and countless guests — they have little or no interaction with. “That profound disconnect … amid all the purple sentiment on the other side of the pipe and drape was almost unbearable,” they write in a section on weddings. But the reader can feel the same way when the Lees describe a salad that takes 12 steps to prepare or run down the inventory contained in the storage facilities of a major party rental company. Still, considering how little the general public knows about the logistics of catering, a fact-packed approach isn’t necessarily unwelcome. (Were you aware that you can use the handle edge of a serving utensil like a spoon or ladle to sharpen your knife? That $500 a head is “pretty close to the New York average for an event when all expenses, including décor and rentals, have been factored in”?) [ Here’s how to talk like a caterer. ] The Lees’ book also effectively — if incidentally — conveys the underlying socioeconomics of the industry, of the conspicuous consumption of patrons versus the invisibility of worker bees. Ultimately, the greatest accomplishment of “Hotbox” is that it’s careful to separate catering from restaurant work, making clear how different they are. In doing so, the authors both explain and ennoble a profession whose mechanics, like those who execute them, “need to be hidden … so the pageant appears effortless.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘I Can’t Breathe’: 5 Years After Eric Garner’s Death, an Officer Faces Trial","Disciplinary proceedings against Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is accused of using a chokehold to subdue Mr. Garner, could lead to his firing. The last words Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, uttered on a New York City sidewalk in 2014 instantly became a national rallying cry against police brutality. “I can’t breathe,’’ Mr. Garner pleaded 11 times after a police officer in plain clothes placed his arm across his neck and pulled him to the ground while other officers handcuffed him. The encounter was captured on a video that ricocheted around the world, set off protests and prompted calls for the officers to be fired and criminally charged. Mr. Garner’s death was part of a succession of police killings across the country that became part of a wrenching conversation about how officers treat people in predominantly poor and minority communities. Now, the officer who wrapped his arm around Mr. Garner’s neck, Daniel Pantaleo, 33, faces a public trial that could lead to his firing. Officer Pantaleo has denied wrongdoing and his lawyer argues that he did not apply a chokehold. The trial, scheduled to start Monday at Police Department headquarters, has been long-awaited by the Garner family, whose campaign to hold the police accountable for what they say is an unjustified use of force took on greater significance after Mr. Garner’s daughter, Erica Garner, died in 2017. The city paid $5.9 million to settle a lawsuit with the family after a grand jury declined to bring criminal charges. But Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration has fought and delayed the family’s efforts to have all the police officers involved in the encounter punished. “It was at least a dozen more who just did nothing, or either they pounced on him, they choked him, they filed false reports,” Mr. Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, said in an interview. “It’s about all of those officers who committed an injustice that day and they all need to stand accountable.” Officer Pantaleo faces charges of reckless use of a chokehold and intentional restriction of breathing. His lawyer says that Officer Pantaleo did not use a chokehold, but a different technique that is taught to officers in training and is known as a seatbelt. So the trial will have to settle two questions at the heart of the case: Was the maneuver Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold? And, if so, was the officer justified in using it to subdue an unarmed man during a low-level arrest? On Thursday, the Police Department judge overseeing the trial said that prosecutors must prove that Officer Pantaleo’s actions went beyond a violation of departmental rules and constituted a crime — an unusually high bar. Video of the fatal encounter was recorded by Ramsey Orta, a friend of Mr. Garner’s who is expected to testify at Officer Pantaleo’s trial. It captured Mr. Garner telling officers in street clothes to leave him alone after they approached him outside a beauty supply store on July 17, 2014, not far from the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. Mr. Garner had repeated encounters with the police and believed that he was being harassed. “This stops today,” he told the officers before they moved to arrest him over accusations that he was selling untaxed cigarettes. As one officer tried to grab Mr. Garner’s hand, he slipped free. Then Officer Pantaleo slid one arm around Mr. Garner’s neck and another under his left arm and dragged him to the ground. On the pavement, he begged for air. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide and said he died from a chokehold and the compression of his chest from lying prone. The findings are a crucial issue in the trial and Officer Pantaleo’s defense lawyer plans to dispute them. Stuart London, the police union lawyer representing Officer Pantaleo, said the technique his client used was the seatbelt maneuver taught in the Police Academy, not a chokehold. He plans to argue that Mr. Garner, who was overweight and severely asthmatic, died because of poor health. “Those who have been able to not come to a rushed judgment, but have looked at the video in explicit detail, see Pantaleo’s intent and objective was to take him down pursuant to how he was taught by NYPD, control him when they got on the ground, and then have him cuffed,” Mr. London said in an interview. “There was never any intent for him to exert pressure on his neck and choke him out the way the case has been portrayed.” The Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent city agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct, is prosecuting the case against Officer Pantaleo and is seeking his termination. But the ruling on Thursday by the judge, Rosemarie Maldonado, the deputy police commissioner in charge of trials, denied Mr. London's motion to dismiss the case. But her ruling means that prosecutors need to prove that Officer Pantaleo’s actions rose to the crimes of assault and strangulation in order to avoid the state's prohibition on bringing misconduct charges more than 18 months after occurrence. Colleen Roache, a spokeswoman for the review board, said prosecutors understood their obligation when they served Officer Pantaleo with the charges last July. But critics have said the review board's failure to file charges sooner had made the prosecutors' case significantly harder to prove. The Police Department banned chokeholds in 1993 amid concern about a rising number of civilian deaths in police custody. In 2016, the department added an exception to its chokehold ban under certain circumstances, which critics said made it easier for officers to justify its use. After Mr. Garner’s death, the Police Department spent $35 million to retrain officers not to use chokeholds, but they continue to use the maneuver and rarely face punishment. The trial is expected to last two weeks, with testimony from about two dozen witnesses. Officer Pantaleo has not decided whether he will testify, Mr. London said. When the trial ends, Deputy Commissioner Maldonado, will decide if Officer Pantaleo is guilty. If guilt is determined, she will recommend a penalty to Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill, who will make the final decision. Short of firing, any discipline of Officer Pantaleo, a 13-year veteran, may never become public because of a state law that shields police disciplinary records from public disclosure. The delays and secrecy surrounding officer discipline are part of the reason that police reform advocates say the public has lost trust in the city’s process for assessing complaints against officers. The de Blasio administration fought to keep prior abuse complaints against Officer Pantaleo secret, including one stemming from a car stop in which the occupants said he strip-searched them on the street. The records were eventually leaked, but the administration won several court rulings broadening the scope of the secrecy law. “It’s been de Blasio and his administration who’ve been blocking the whole time that I’ve been trying to get the officers fired,” Ms. Carr said. The trial will revisit a painful chapter marked by months of protests with marchers chanting Mr. Garner’s final words. Not long after a Staten Island grand jury in December 2014 decided not to charge Officer Pantaleo with a crime, two officers were ambushed and killed by a gunman while sitting in their patrol car. To Mr. Garner’s family and their supporters, his death discredited a crime-fighting strategy that the police and mayors have cited repeatedly as helping to drive crime rates to their lowest level in recent history. The strategy relies on targeting lower-level offenses that the police believe create the environment for more violent crime. But critics say it has resulted in racial profiling, targeting mostly black and Latino men in poorer neighborhoods. The Police Department delayed disciplinary proceedings against Officer Pantaleo for years because of an ongoing federal investigation. But with prosecutors in the Department of Justice divided over whether to bring charges, police officials decided to allow the disciplinary process to move forward. Officer Pantaleo and Sergeant Kizzy Adonis, who was the first supervisor to arrive on the scene where the police were confronting Mr. Garner, were stripped of their guns and placed on desk jobs. Sergeant Adonis, who has since been restored to full duty, has been administratively charged with failing to properly oversee officers, but a date for her disciplinary trial has not been set. A state judge recently denied Officer Pantaleo’s motion to have the civilian review board removed from the case. He argued that the agency lacked jurisdiction because the person who filed the complaint was not involved or an eyewitness. “It’s time for Eric Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, the rest of the Garner family, and the people of the City of New York to have closure,” Fred Davie, the chairman of the civilian review board, said in a statement. On the stretch of Bay Street where Mr. Garner died, the type of behavior that drew police attention five years ago persists. People peddle loose cigarettes and a sign affixed to a door outside an apartment building warns against selling heroin on a stoop. “It’s a hustle block,” Christopher Sweat, a retired chef, said. “It’s a regular mood until the cops get called.” Nearby, a plaque memorializes Mr. Garner’s death as a murder, adding, “May his soul rest in peace.” Passers-by on a recent afternoon were unanimous in their belief that Officer Pantaleo deserved to be fired. “It was a blatant chokehold,” said Keenen Hill, 46, a maintenance man who lives in the neighborhood. “Stevie Wonder saw that.” Laura Dimon and Ali Winston contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Did My Best to Stop American Foreign Policy’: Bernie Sanders on the 1980s,"In an interview, one of the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination discusses his long-held opposition to war and his support for socialist leaders. As Burlington’s mayor from 1981 to 1989, Bernie Sanders tried to infuse local politics with international issues. From his earliest days in office, Mr. Sanders aimed to execute his own foreign policy, repudiating President Ronald Reagan’s aggressive support for anti-communist governments and resistance forces, while going further than many Democrats in backing socialist leaders. In an article on Friday, The New York Times detailed Mr. Sanders’s foreign policy views during his mayoralty, including on the Sandinista government in Nicaragua and on the Soviet Union, and how his activities at the time brought into relief the fervently anti-imperialist worldview that would continue to guide him. Mr. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, initially declined an interview request for the article. But after it was published, he requested a phone interview. The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation. Mr. Sanders Let me just say this: I plead guilty to, throughout my adult life, doing everything that I can to prevent war and destruction. As a young person, long before I ever held any position, I was active in opposition to the war in Vietnam. As a mayor, I did my best to stop American foreign policy, which for years was overthrowing governments in Latin America and installing puppet regimes. I did everything that I could as a mayor of a small city to stop the United States from getting involved in another war in Central America trying to overthrow a government. [Read how Mr. Sanders tried to infuse left-wing foreign policy into Vermont politics in the 1980s.] I am very proud that in my small city, we established two sister-city programs which I believe honestly are still going on today — one with Yaroslavl, a city in Russia, the other with a city, Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua. And I happen to believe that cultural exchanges and student exchanges are a very important tool to try to bring people together and avoid wars. While we’re at it, I also helped lead the opposition to the war in Iraq, I voted against the first war and I voted against the second war. I’ve done everything I can to try to get the United States out of Yemen in a war that is causing unbelievable destruction in that country. And I will do everything I can to see us not getting involved in a war in Iran. That is my view, and I make no apologies for it. Q. In the top of our story, we talk about the rally you attended in Managua and a wire report at the time said that there were anti-American chants from the crowd. The United States at that time — I don’t know how much you know about this — was actively supporting the Contras to overthrow the government. So that there’s anti-American sentiment? I remember that, I remember that event very clearly. You do recall hearing those chants? I think the wire report has them saying, “Here, there, everywhere, the Yankee will die.” They were fighting against American —— Huh huh —— yes, what is your point? I wanted to —— Are you shocked to learn that there was anti-American sentiment? My point was I wanted to know if you had heard that. I don’t remember, no. Of course there was anti-American sentiment there. This was a war being funded by the United States against the people of Nicaragua. People were being killed in that war. Do you think if you had heard that directly, you would have stayed at the rally? I think Sydney, with all due respect, you don’t understand a word that I’m saying. Do you believe you had an accurate view of President Ortega at the time? I’m wondering if you’re —— This was not about Ortega. Do you understand? I don’t know if you do or not. Do you know that the United States overthrew the government of Chile way back? Do you happen to know that? Do you? I’m asking you a simple question. What point do you want to make? My point is that fascism developed in Chile as a result of that. The United States overthrew the government of Guatemala, a democratically elected government, overthrew the government of Brazil. I strongly oppose U.S. policy, which overthrows governments, especially democratically elected governments, around the world. So this issue is not so much Nicaragua or the government of Nicaragua. The issue was, should the United States continue a policy of overthrowing governments in Latin America and Central America? I believed then that it was wrong, and I believe today it is wrong. That’s why I do not believe the United States should overthrow the government of Venezuela. I’m wondering if now you view Ortega and the government differently knowing what you do now? Well, this is now 30 years later, right? Something like that. I am very concerned about the anti-democratic policies of the Ortega government, yes. Is there anything you believed about Latin America or the Soviet Union in the 1980s that you no longer believe today? No. The Soviet Union was an authoritarian dictatorship, and that’s what I believed then and that’s what I believe the case to be today. That’s what they were. On the other hand, I was going to do everything that I could to prevent a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. During your visit to Yaroslavl, you contrasted the American and Soviet economic systems, and praised aspects of the Soviet system, like the free provision of health care and the efficiency of mass transit. Do you still admire those aspects of the Soviet system? The principle of providing free health care to all is absolutely right. The truth also is the Soviet system — the quality of care in the Soviet Union — was not particularly good. But the principle of providing free health care or the principle of providing affordable housing is a good principle. The quality of housing in the Soviet Union was not particularly good. So what the Soviet Union did is provided things to people either free or inexpensively, but the quality was not very good. You consistently described American defense and weapons spending as draining the country’s social welfare and municipal infrastructure. As president, how much would you seek to shift funds away from the military and toward social welfare? I don’t know what the word social welfare means. What does that mean? Does that mean rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure? Is that called social welfare? Does that mean making public colleges and universities tuition-free? I think we must maintain a strong defense, but I think military spending can be cut, and that money can be used to make sure that our kids are able to get a quality education, that we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Can you describe what foreign policy under President Sanders would look like? You talk a lot about diplomacy, and when you were mayor, you talked about person-to-person contact. What does that look like? It means working with our allies to try to resolve the very difficult international conflicts that exist all over the world. It means putting money into the state department, having the best diplomat that we can to try to bring people together. Now, right now, John Bolton apparently is itching for a war in Iran. In my view, what we should be doing is telling Saudi Arabia — which is a despotic, murderous regime — that they have got to start sitting down and negotiating with Iran to create peace in the region, not to make even worse a very volatile situation. I actually agreed with Trump — one of the very few times I did — in terms of his willingness to sit down with Kim Jong Un and try to work out the very difficult situation of North Korean nuclear weapons. But basically what it means is using our incredible resources to try to bring warring factions together. We have the best military in the world and at points it may be that I’m not a pacifist and it may be necessary to use that military. I think we go as far as we possibly can to try to bring about diplomatic solutions to problems and not engage in military conflict. Do you think your view on foreign policy, and how to conduct it, separates you from other Democrats? Well, I believe the United States is the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth. So I believe — and don’t hear me to say otherwise — that the United States must play a leading role in the world on international affairs. I believe that. I don’t believe that we should go about overthrowing governments, and I don’t believe that we should be engaged in endless wars. But the United States has the capacity to — with its wealth and with its military power — to do everything possible to support democracy and human rights and peaceful resolutions to international conflict. If that separates me from other Democratic candidates, so be it.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘I Don’t Even Know How to Talk to the Other Side About This’,"Abortion legislation in Alabama has stoked strong opinions, and the differences between them are stark. Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Kay Ivey, Alabama’s Republican governor, this week signed some of the most restrictive abortion legislation this country has seen in decades into law. In response, thousands of women took up the #YouKnowMe hashtag torch on social media, sharing their abortion stories and urging others to do the same. Readers whose beliefs place them on both sides of the issue have responded passionately to The Times’s opinion coverage of the Alabama law and similar legislation in other states. A selection of comments from readers are below. They have been edited for length and clarity. I read with dread about the Alabama law’s prevention of abortion in the case of “nonviable” fetuses. Those of us from families whose members have given birth to children who fit this definition may be dismayed that, should the diagnosis have preceded the birth, we still would have been forced to endure the consequences of bringing the pregnancy to term under this new law. Cruelty is the only word for it. — Portola, Bethesda, Md. I hope the governor of Alabama is listening to survivors of rape, incest, the death of a fetus. The physical and emotional changes that accompany pregnancy are almost unendurable once a doctor tells you, as mine told me, that the baby wouldn’t be born alive. Can you imagine being forced to go through pregnancy and delivery of a baby born to someone who survived a rape or became pregnant by incest? Does cruelty know no bounds? — Kathyb, Seattle Imagine how different the abortion issue would be cast if a woman who became pregnant against her will could file for damages against the male participant in the pregnancy. Without the remedy of abortion, it is the woman who suffers physically, emotionally and economically. The man may have regrets, but he pays a comparatively low price for his participation. As is obvious, the deck is stacked against girls and women by all-male or majority-male legislatures. — Litote, Fullerton, Calif. Has anyone considered the viability of counter-legislation? It’s far-fetched, but what if there were laws requiring mandatory DNA testing to determine paternal responsibility; paternal wage garnishing to financially support the mother and unborn child for the duration of the pregnancy; custody automatically transferring by law to the father if the mother declines custody after birth; in the case of rape or incest, taxpayer dollars are allocated to fund support of the mother and child, including all prenatal health care, mental heath care for the mother and safe housing where the mother will not be in danger of abuse. If men or conservative legislators were actually held accountable for the safety, financial security and futures of the unwanted children in whose interest they are supposedly passing anti-abortion laws, perhaps they might reconsider these draconian measures. — Elisabeth MTR, Connecticut I just read a related piece on how the new laws in Alabama and Georgia are going to have an impact on men. This is new and it’s true: both those states also have strict paternity and child support laws. Now that their menfolk are going to be saddled with a child, let’s see how quickly this discussion turns around. — Myasara, Brooklyn There is nothing positive about the act of abortion. It is always because of some failure — to avoid pregnancy when contraception is available, of ethics or common decency if rape is involved, or of genetics or illness. No one should celebrate the event. I am O.K. if women are given the right to choose, and for God, if there is one, to punish. That’s above my pay grade. But don’t ask me to celebrate the right. We should unite to continue to drive the numbers down, both Democrats and Republicans — John Morton, Florida I am not a fan of abortion. My wife and I had such a hard time getting pregnant that the thought of it is unconscionable to me. If a state were to write into its charter that they must fund public education and children’s health care at the national average, and if they were to also make it easier to adopt (including for LGBTQ couples), I would actually be O.K. with a ban on abortion, like what Alabama just did. — ZAW, Tex. I don’t support abortion because it prematurely ends a human life without their consent. You might ask me, what about the autonomy of the woman and her rights over her body? I have a young child, and another one on the way. I get up in the middle of the night when he’s sick or can’t sleep. I can’t leave the house after he goes to bed. I spend a huge portion of my paycheck for his expenses that no longer can pay for things I would like. These are all restrictions on what I can do with myself. If I stop taking care of him, the state will intervene and punish me for neglecting my responsibilities. Being a responsible member of society means we can’t always do whatever we want with ourselves. Being pregnant is no different. — William, Huntsville, Ala. I’m a millennial. My fear is that the women of my generation won’t be spurred to action because the idea of having an illegal abortion is such a foreign concept that it doesn’t seem realistic. The problem, of course, is that unsafe, illegal abortions could very well become a reality now. — Robin, Atlanta It may be worthwhile to consider that every female of childbearing age was born after Roe v. Wade became law. These women are not going to be willing to cede their autonomy to strangers. — Pat, Texas I wonder if the Gen-Xers and Millennials really get what’s at stake. They’ve never had to use wire hangers. — Rachel Hoffman, Portland, Ore. My son’s wife had a miscarriage during her third month of pregnancy. Would the doctor who treated her during this sad event be charged as a criminal? I had a vasectomy after the birth of my second child. Will Alabama prosecute the doctor who performed the vasectomy because I could no longer get my wife pregnant? Can I be arrested and prosecuted too? Are condoms, I.U.D.s and birth control pills and patches soon to be outlawed? It seems like the states that invoke the specter of “Shariah Law” are now promoting the specter of “biblical Christian Law,” a judicial approach just as restrictive. — Pete, Houston Remarkably, I’m one of the few from a blue state who is yelling “Hooray!” in light of Alabama’s new abortion law. It’s disappointing to see society in America say that killing an unborn baby is moving forward in our world. Pro-life supporters like me aren’t supporting “Christian Shariah law.” We support the existence of human lives, not seeing a baby’s chance of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness being wiped away without knowing. — Andrew Zhang, Tenafly, N.J. Roe v. Wade has never been properly explained or defended. People are all over the map about abortion. But Americans are not divided over the right to privacy. We are one of the most individualistic peoples on earth and the busybody neighbor, the busybody relative and the busybody government are all unpopular. SCOTUS did not “legalize” abortion. It vacated state-level abortion laws by saying that Americans have a right to privacy. The debate is this: Do you value your constitutional right to privacy? — Douglas Green, Vancouver, Wash. Justice Roberts isn’t stupid. He won’t set up the Republican Party for failure in 2020 by allowing an outright overruling of Roe v. Wade before the election. He will continue supporting his majority’s policy of killing Roe in stages by allowing incremental restrictions to its terms until there is no Roe left to destroy. — Andrew Zuckerman, Port Washington, N.Y. I don’t even know how to talk to the other side about this. Being pro-choice, I believe the right to an abortion is about women’s freedom and rights. It’s about the right to control what happens to your own body. Pro-lifers believe that having an abortion is the moral equivalent of going into a maternity ward and stabbing babies. We’re not even having the same conversation. I don’t know how to bridge that gap. — Zoe, Alaska Either a woman is fully human, an end in and of herself, or she is the means to another’s end. Disqualifying a woman from decisions regarding her own body and life reduces the woman to a means, a slave, a machine, a thing that produces babies for the benefit of others and not herself. Abortion is not the issue. The issue is whether a simple medical decision by a rational person is one that is trumped by one who is not. — Maxine and Max, Brooklyn The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Opinion | ‘I Don’t Want an Exciting President’,"Joe Biden makes his supporters feel safe, but nominating him is risky. Opinion Columnist On Saturday afternoon, at Joe Biden’s official campaign kickoff rally in Philadelphia, I asked every attendee I met why they were supporting, or at least considering supporting, the former vice president. Often, they mentioned other people whom they thought Biden might appeal to. Again and again, they said they cared about beating Donald Trump above all else. “On my list of 10 things, 1 to 10 is beat Donald,” said Shyvette Brown, 63. “Health care is 11. And everything else comes after that.” Brown said that she likes Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, but 2016 made her think that Americans aren’t ready to elect a woman. “I don’t like it,” she said. “I don’t think it’s fair.” But given the stakes, she wants the surest possible bet. “We can’t play. This is all or nothing. This is the end game right here.” I agree with Brown’s priorities. Nothing is more important than voting Trump out next year, and I suspect that Biden is surging in the polls in part because, rather than pretend that the election is about so-called kitchen table issues, he’s taking on Trump’s desecration of the presidency directly. What worries me about Biden — above and beyond policy disagreements — is that, in contemporary politics, the quest to find an electable candidate hasn’t resulted in candidates that actually win. Voters don’t do themselves any favors when they try to think like pundits. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] “My heart still belongs to Howard Dean because of his passion, but my head says Kerry is the one who can get elected,” a voter told The New York Times in 2004, when Democrats were desperate to unseat George W. Bush. Many Democrats thought that John Kerry, a war hero, could puncture the puffed-up commander-in-chief aura that surrounded Bush, who’d kept himself out of Vietnam. It didn’t work out that way. Four years later, Democrats decided to follow their hearts and nominate Barack Obama, who spoke to their most sublime hopes for their country. Republicans, meanwhile, went with John McCain, who’d often infuriated the party’s base, but whose campaign emphasized his general election viability. A poll in January 2008 showed that he was seen as the most electable of the Republican candidates, and one of his advertisements claimed that he could “rally the conservative Reagan coalition while appealing to independent voters to win in November.” He picked the risible Sarah Palin as a running mate to whip up energy on the right, but still lost. By the time of the next presidential cycle, Republicans were even more obsessed with besting Obama, leading them to once again put a premium on electability. “The only reason I’m supporting Romney is because he can win the election,” a conservative voter in Iowa told The Washington Post in 2011. Romney, of course, couldn’t win the election. It wasn’t until 2016 that a plurality of Republican voters defied the electoral wisdom of party elites, nominating a clownish demagogue who channeled the id of the far right and was supposed to have no chance of victory. We all know what happened next. Democrats are now in a complicated spot as they make their electoral calculations. If what you care about most is a candidate’s chances next November, then pretending otherwise is an artificial exercise, particularly if it’s just in the service of making a better judgment about electability. And some enthusiasm for Biden is genuine, if not passionate; often, when people I spoke to at the rally described him as “safe,” they meant both as a candidate and as a potential leader. “I don’t want an exciting president,” said Sue Kane, a 58-year-old commercial real estate appraiser. “We have a lot of excitement right now, in a bad way.” Fair enough. For many voters, what Biden is promising — a rebuke of Trump and a return to normalcy — is what they want more than anything else, and it makes sense for them to back him. What’s counterproductive, I think, is when voters try to think past their own desires. “There’s two parts of me,” said Shelby Ferguson, a 22-year-old who just graduated from Temple University. “The political science major part of me that is trying to be as rational as possible,” and figure out who can rally Middle America to beat Trump, she said. “That part of me is saying Joe.” But she’s also someone who just left school and is worried about student loans and health care, and that side of her thrills to Warren and Bernie Sanders. I hope voters like Ferguson go with the candidates who rouse them, because it’s often the best way to figure out who will rouse others. Given the existential stakes in 2020, it’s tempting for Democrats to put their own preferences aside and strike mental bargains with groups of people they may have never met. But being attentive to how candidates make us feel gives us valuable information. Intensity — the thing that turns a campaign into a movement, that leads people to donate more than they can afford, host house parties and spend their free time knocking on the doors of strangers’ houses — matters. That’s especially true in a country as polarized as ours, where turnout is as important as persuasion. Ultimately, the paradox of primaries is that it’s most strategic to ignore the experts and follow your emotions. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘I Felt Terrible. True New Yorkers Don’t Acknowledge Celebrities.’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Repeated encounters with a sitcom legend, a bad time to do the laundry and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: In the early 2000s, I lived on the Upper East and worked in Midtown. I would walk to work and then back home to save money and get some exercise at the same time. One night, crossing Park Avenue in the 60s on my way home, I noticed a crowd gathered around a man I recognized as Henry Winkler. Despite a strong urge not to, I put two thumbs up and gave him an “Ayyy!” He gave me his best “leave me alone” look. I felt terrible. True New Yorkers don’t acknowledge celebrities. The next day, I mentioned what had happened to a co-worker and wondered whether it really was Henry Winkler. My co-worker had read in the paper that day that he was in New York to star in a Broadway show and that it must have been him. That night, I walked home along the same block, saw a crowd and noticed Mr. Winkler there again. Again, despite the strongest urge not to, I gave him a thumbs-up “Ayyy!” He looked at me as though he wanted to punch me. The next day, my co-worker laughed and said I had to continue the routine until Mr. Winkler acknowledged me. Walking home that night, I saw a crowd and in the middle, Mr. Winkler. As I got closer, he noticed me and just stared. I knew by then that I had better just keep walking. But when I got within a few feet of him, I heard him yell, “Hey! Hey!” I looked over. He had two thumbs up and a huge smile on his face. “Ayyyyy!” — Wasim Husain Dear Diary: I live in a small town in Western Massachusetts. Last summer, a good friend of mine was lamenting how her daughter, a recent college graduate, was going off to live in Manhattan. “I told her she’s never going to run into anyone she knows,” my friend said. “It will be full of strangers all the time.” Imagine my surprise when, walking on the Upper East Side one evening last fall with a friend who lives in New York, I heard someone call my name. It was my friend’s daughter. She was rushing to ballet class and had thought she heard my voice. — Catherine Sanderson Dear Diary: I have gotten used to seeing women put on makeup on the subway. It amazes me that they can do it so easily on a moving train with only the help of a small pocket mirror. One morning during rush hour, I watched a young man sitting opposite me in a tweed jacket and jeans, with headphones in his ears, follow the same routine. He took a black and gold makeup bag from his tote, and applied eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara and even foundation without a smudge. I didn’t want to stare but I really wanted to watch and copy his technique. It had been years since I wore makeup and now that I really need to, I had forgotten how. When the young man finished his face, he took out a book and started to read. And I realized he had given me the courage to try wearing makeup again. — Judith Pierce Dear Diary: My first Manhattan apartment, 50 years ago, was a rent-controlled studio on East 51st Street in a building with no washing machines. Fortunately, the doorman building across the street had washers and dryers accessible through an open street-level door. One day, though, the door was locked, so I put my laundry in a suitcase, changed out of jeans and into a skirt and went up to the doorman. “Good morning,” I said. “Good morning,” he said. “But don’t use dryer No. 3. It’s not working.” — Joyce Gold Dear Diary: I was at work at the register at a large Manhattan retailer when a man I assumed was a customer approached me and asked how long I had worked there. Seven and a half years, I said. He asked if I had ever lost anything of value at work like a watch or jewelry. Totally surprised, I told him I had lost a diamond ring about five years ago. He asked what color it was. I gave him a description: a white diamond in a platinum, diamond and marcasite setting from the 1920s, using my grandmother’s engagement stone from 1913. He took a small drawstring bag out of his pocket, untied it and shook something into the palm of his hand. My ring! When I asked him how he had it, he said it might have fallen off my finger while packing a shopping bag. Then he walked away with no further explanation. — Carolyn Taranto Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines. Reach us via email diary@nytimes.com or follow @NYTMetro on Twitter.

2019,Opinion | ‘I Had Completely Lost the Knack for Staying Alive’,"Warmer weather brings daffodils, rhubarb at the farmer’s market — and, for some, despair. Ms. Cregan is the author of “The Scar.” It’s a popular and perhaps dangerous belief, reinforced by that inescapable Christmas classic “It’s a Wonderful Life,” that winter is the peak season for suicide. Yet experts have known since the late 1800s that it’s not true: More people take their own lives in the spring months than in other times of the year. No definitive explanations have emerged for why this is so. I can offer an unscientific one from my own experience. For those who are trapped in despair, spring can feel like an affront, the gulf between outer and inner worlds too wide to cross. The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay hinted as much in her poem “Spring,” which asks, “To what purpose, April, do you return again?” Rejecting the season’s bright optimism, the poem concludes: “It is not enough that yearly, down this hill, / April / Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.” What has happened to people for whom the beauty of spring, and the coming pleasures of summer, offer no consolation? More than 30 years ago, I tried to end my life at this time of year. The previous December my first child, a girl named Anna, died two days after she was born. Her fatal heart defect came as a terrible shock. Haunted by a line from Samuel Beckett — “They give birth astride of a grave” — I entered a state of deepening depression that went unrecognized because it looked so much like the grief that would be normal under the circumstances. I was grieving, of course, but as the weeks passed I realized that I had also completely lost the knack for staying alive. Whatever engine in the brain or body keeps people moving forward, driven by the biological instinct for survival, had simply sputtered out in me. Unaware that I was gradually being engulfed in a severe depressive illness, I couldn’t understand how everyone else could be so busily engaged in their lives, productive, even happy, while I was paralyzed, obsessed with the meaningless of what had happened to my child. Within weeks, anxiety had become an overwhelming physical sensation. I couldn’t sleep for more than a few hours at a time. I awoke in the dark, at three or four in the morning, and sat up with my heart pounding, my mind spinning its wheels through the various unlikely fixes for the unmoored condition I was in: get a new job, apply to graduate school, move back to the city, move to the countryside. Suicide began to press itself into this list of potential solutions. The powerful feeling of loss had turned into something else: a constant thrumming of dread. Each day felt endless, with no sense of forward motion, no belief that I would ever feel better. Time was unbearable: time needed to stop. One morning I admitted aloud that it would be better if I were dead. At this late stage, I consulted a psychiatrist who confirmed that this was more than grief: I was experiencing a major depressive episode, with melancholia. He prescribed an antidepressant, but after a few weeks on medication I was no better, and he suggested that I check myself in to a psychiatric hospital. I didn’t know anyone who had been in a psychiatric hospital, and feared the stigma attached to that. By then it was March, and I kept hoping that if only I could survive the long winter that began with my daughter’s birth and death, I would feel better with the coming of spring. At the time I was a book designer for a publishing company in Midtown Manhattan, and on a sunny day just after the equinox I went into St. Patrick’s Cathedral on my lunch hour and lit a candle for my daughter. I knelt in a pew and read the 23rd Psalm several times, asking God to help me preserve my life, and hoping to feel some shift in my state of mind. But as I emerged from the cathedral’s shadowy interior into a bright afternoon where spring was definitely in the air, my despair was just as overwhelming as it had been all winter long. I walked back to my office, picked up the X-Acto knife from the drafting table, and took the train home. After cutting my wrists, I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. But my hopelessness — my inability to believe I would ever feel better or regain a desire to live — was so powerful that I was certain I would never get out of there. My second and far more life-threatening suicide attempt took place two days later on the locked unit. A scar on my throat, still visible, reminds me of that day and the dark time leading up to it. I came perilously close to becoming a statistic, confirming the dangers the deeply depressed face come spring. In the decades since, thanks to effective treatment — electroshock, a fine therapist — I have found satisfying work and been blessed with a happy marriage, good friends, and a son who will soon graduate from college. These years have been the lucky continuation of a life that came all too close to ending. Depression is still with me, though well managed with medication and regular exercise. But I’m aware that people lose their lives in situations similar to what mine was: in unrecognized and undiagnosed mood disorders or in situations where their lives are unrecognizable after trauma or heartbreak. For a long time, winters were very hard to get through. It was as though my body remembered Anna’s death and the dark months that followed. The arrival of my son, 13 years later, helped me to feel better during that time of year. Now I look forward eagerly to the spring. It brings new pleasures by the week — asparagus in the farmers’ market, excitable toddlers in the playgrounds — and also a reminder to try to reach out to people who have lost someone recently, or those who seem withdrawn. They may need to be given a chance to talk about how they’re doing, and if things are very bad, encouraged to get the professional support they need. I can confirm that with time, help and love, things get better. My birthday arrived in April, with the daffodils. I’m another year older, and so grateful to be here.

2019,‘I Quickly Turned the Tie Around to Show Her the Manufacturer’s Name’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Shakespeare takes the train, belting out Heart in the back of a cab and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I was standing on a crowded No. 6 train. I looked down to see that a woman sitting there was staring directly at me. More specifically, she was staring at my tie. It had a Shakespeare theme, with images of his face and quotations from his works. “Where did you get that tie?” she asked. “My mother,” I said sheepishly. Not surprisingly, there was a bit of laughter around me. “Where can I get one?” the woman asked. I quickly turned the tie around to show her the manufacturer’s name. She snapped a picture. “Do you teach Shakespeare?” she asked. “Only on the subway,” I said. — James Devitt Dear Diary: I was in Midtown, heading to my office on the East Side. It was summer, and I was in the back of a taxi with the windows down. We were idling in midday traffic, waiting for the light to turn. The opening piano notes of “Alone” by Heart came on the radio. The cabdriver, a man in his 30s, nudged the volume knob ever so slightly. Not a lot, but enough that I took notice. Then he did it again, and the music got a little louder. I leaned forward. “I love this song, too,” I said. “Turn it up!” He did. And then, with no prompting whatsoever — and to the apparent delight of many pedestrians nearby — we belted the chorus out in unison at the top of our lungs. We were having so much fun that we carried that tune together straight to the end of the song. The final notes coincided with the end of the ride. The cabby pulled over to let me out. He turned around and said that the song was his favorite of all time and that the ride would be a favorite memory. “Me, too,” I said. “Me, too.” — Christina Poletto Dear Diary: Years ago, as a summer intern, I was dispatched to Fordham University to repair the set of an outdoor musical theater production that had been damaged by heavy winds. Unfortunately, the time available to make the repairs before the performance scheduled for that evening coincided with an orchestra rehearsal. A few hours later, the repairs and the rehearsal were complete, and I had received a round of applause from the members of the orchestra after learning to hammer in time to the music. I was reminded of that episode recently as a ventilation duct was being built in my building’s courtyard. I could hear the workers hammering sheet metal to the rhythms of Chinese opera. — Neile Weissman Dear Diary: In fall 1999, I was single and I decided to have a party where single men and women could meet. The caveat was that everyone I invited had to bring an equally unattached friend, presumably someone they were not romantically interested in. The party was a great success, and at around 10 p.m. the doorbell rang. I opened the door to two men dressed in dark clothes. I introduced myself as the hostess. “Come on in gentlemen,” I said. “The party is just getting started.” The older of the two stepped forward. “Excuse me ma’am,” he said. “We’re from the 20th Precinct, and we had a noise complaint from one of your neighbors.” I started to offer to turn the music down while apologizing for any inconvenience when the younger of the two officers stepped into the apartment. To my surprise, he took my hand and started dancing with me. We danced until the song ended. The officer leaned toward me. “I’m getting off at 11,” he said, before asking whether he could come back after his shift ended. “Of course,” I said. The officers left. Around 11:30, the younger officer returned. He ended up being one of the last guests to leave. — Melaney Mashburn Dear Diary: On a recent visit to my barber of more than 30 years, I had a special request. “I have a date tonight,” I said. “And your job is to make me look pretty.” After 20 minutes of meticulous snipping, he pointed to my image in the mirror. “How’s that?” he asked. “The hair looks fine” I said. “But what about my face?” He looked at me. “I’m a barber,” he said, “not a magician.” — Arthur Schaffer Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,"‘I Recognize That I Can Do a Better Job,’ Beto O’Rourke Says","WASHINGTON — Former Representative Beto O’Rourke said Monday he “can do a better job” of communicating his 2020 campaign message, acknowledging that he must take steps to revive his once-promising presidential bid after seeing his polling dip in recent weeks. Appearing on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show, Mr. O’Rourke said that after two months in the race, and “more than 150 town halls,” he recognized he had to broaden his strategy to appeal to a national audience and not only the voters and news media at his events. “I have an opportunity to answer your questions, Rachel, and address those who may not have been able to attend them and make sure that they can hear what this campaign is about and how I answer the questions that are put to me,” he said. “So I hope that I’m continuing to do better over time.” It was a striking concession from Mr. O’Rourke, whose surprisingly strong challenge against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas last year vaulted him into national prominence and won him high expectations when he entered the presidential race. [Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.] But after his highly anticipated debut, and a strong surge of fund-raising that accompanied it, Mr. O’Rourke has struggled in this sprawling Democratic field to replicate the energy that infused his Senate bid. He has often sounded like the candidate from Texas he once was, rather than a White House hopeful, while sprinkling his stump speech with anecdotes from the Senate race. And his polling has sagged, both in national surveys and in the leadoff nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Now Mr. O’Rourke is all but acknowledging that he must reset his presidential candidacy. In addition to making his first appearance on Ms. Maddow’s show as a White House hopeful, Mr. O’Rourke is scheduled to appear on “The View” on Tuesday, and this month he will also participate in a CNN town hall in Iowa. “I recognize that I can do a better job, also, of talking to a national audience beyond the town halls we are having,” he said after Ms. Maddow asked him about an Associated Press article from last weekend about the reintroduction of his campaign. At the same time, Mr. O’Rourke made a case for himself, arguing that he could help fulfill the longstanding Democratic goal of putting Texas into play. “Texas and its 38 Electoral College votes have been unlocked,” he said. “They are in contention, and we will have a seat at the table.” [Check the election calendar: The first debate is next month.] Facing largely friendly questions from Ms. Maddow after an initial inquiry about his campaign’s difficulties, Mr. O’Rourke took aim at President Trump, calling his foreign policy “a complete disaster” and accusing him of seeking “to cover up or obstruct justice.” His new interview strategy amounts to an admission that this primary is taking place as much on television and social media as it is at the town halls and coffee shop visits that he live-streamed in his Senate campaign and that he perhaps assumed would translate in the presidential race. Mr. O’Rourke, who bridled last month when he was asked at an event in Virginia why he was not on television more, is hardly alone in bowing to the new format. The televised candidate forums and town halls have become highly watched events among the most engaged voters; it was Pete Buttigieg’s CNN town hall in March that elevated the South Bend mayor’s campaign among many voters and activists. Yet Mr. O’Rourke is not only shifting his campaign style. He is also attempting to broaden his appeal with more specific policy proposals: His first was a sweeping plan to address climate change, and he has taken steps to professionalize his campaign. His campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, settled at his El Paso headquarters this month and has installed Jeff Berman to run Mr. O’Rourke’s delegate strategy. Both Ms. O’Malley Dillon and Mr. Berman are veterans of former President Barack Obama’s campaigns. And on Monday, Mr. O’Rourke held his first major fund-raiser of the campaign, appearing with supporters in New York City. But his interview illustrated how much his political stock has fallen: He did not appear until 35 minutes into the program, well after Ms. Maddow delivered her usual monologue. video",The New York Times
2019,‘Ink’ Spot: Rupert and Friends Catch Murdoch Play on Broadway,"Rupert Murdoch has a couple of small quibbles with “Ink,” the British play about his rise as a media mogul, which he saw Tuesday night on Broadway. Mr. Murdoch was there at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater with an entourage of past and present editors of The Sun, the British tabloid at the heart of the play. Other attendees included Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of Mr. Murdoch’s News UK, who was embroiled in the infamous phone hacking scandal; David Dinsmore, another News UK executive; and Tony Gallagher, the editor in chief of The Sun. Also there was Col Allan, a former editor of The New York Post who was recently brought back to help run the paper. James Graham’s play focuses on Mr. Murdoch’s 1969 takeover of The Sun and its transformation into an influential mass-market tabloid. It had its premiere on Broadway this spring after opening in London in 2017, and has been nominated for six Tony Awards, including best play. A spokeswoman for the production said on Wednesday that a representative from News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch’s media company that publishes The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, had reached out to Rupert Goold, the play’s director, to say they were buying tickets to the play and wanted to meet the cast. After the show on Tuesday, Mr. Murdoch and the other editors met with many of the performers — including Bertie Carvel, the actor who plays him — onstage. Mr. Carvel was unavailable for comment on Wednesday, but in a statement he thanked Mr. Murdoch for being “generous with his time.” He said that he asked Mr. Murdoch whether there was anything about the play he would change. Mr. Murdoch, according to the statement, said no but added that there were “one or two points of fact about which he’d quibble.” “I can’t say it was the most relaxed performance I’ve ever given,” said Mr. Carvel, whose performance has earned him a Tony nomination, “but there was definitely electricity in the air.” Ben Brantley, in his New York Times review, compared the Murdoch character to Mephistopheles. “As drawn with Dickensian relish by Bertie Carvel, this Murdoch is indeed a man of wealth and taste, with a surprising touch of the prig,” Mr. Brantley wrote. “And by artfully tapping into the most primal instincts of those he would have do his bidding, Mr. Carvel’s Murdoch is someone to whom it is all but impossible to say no.” Through a spokesman, Mr. Murdoch declined to comment. The play’s spokeswoman said that, when Mr. Murdoch drew close to the set pieces onstage, he marveled at how similar the newsroom desks looked to the ones they worked at in the 1960s. This was Mr. Murdoch’s first time at “Ink” on Broadway, though he had seen it in London, the spokeswoman said. The play may be set in the past, but it foreshadows the present era in which one man controls Fox News Channel, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. The Sun remains powerful in Britain, where it is thought to have influenced the country’s vote to leave the European Union.",The New York Times
2019,‘It Chapter Two’ Trailer: Watch Jessica Chastain Get Creeped Out,"The first teaser for “It Chapter Two” starts slowly, as Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) revisits her childhood hometown, Derry, Me. That’s where she and the rest of the so-called Losers Club were terrorized by the clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) 27 years earlier. But something’s odd about the little old lady who lives there, and Beverly soon suspects she’s Pennywise’s equally creepy daughter — and Daddy’s paying a visit. That scene takes up more than two-thirds of the nearly three-minute clip, and what follows is a barrage of images. Beverly and her grown friends (now played by the likes of James McAvoy and Bill Hader) reconvene to battle Pennywise yet again. There’s a bathtub full of blood and plenty of red balloons, which the psycho circus performer used to lure a young boy to his death in the original 2017 smash “It.” Based on Stephen King’s novel, that film grossed more than $700 million worldwide, and its young stars (who also include Finn Wolfhard of “Stranger Things”) appear in the sequel and its trailer. “It Chapter Two” hits theaters on Sept. 6, nearly two years to the day after the first movie’s release.",The New York Times
2019,"‘It Was Like a Zoo’: Death on an Unruly, Overcrowded Everest","NEW DELHI — Ed Dohring, a doctor from Arizona, had dreamed his whole life of reaching the top of Mount Everest. But when he summited a few days ago, he was shocked by what he saw. Climbers were pushing and shoving to take selfies. The flat part of the summit, which he estimated at about the size of two Ping-Pong tables, was packed with 15 or 20 people. To get up there, he had to wait hours in a line, chest to chest, one puffy jacket after the next, on an icy, rocky ridge with a several-thousand foot drop. He even had to step around the body of a woman who had just died. “It was scary,” he said by telephone from Kathmandu, Nepal, where he was resting in a hotel room. “It was like a zoo.” This has been one of the deadliest climbing seasons on Everest, with at least 11 deaths. And at least some seem to have been avoidable. The problem hasn’t been avalanches, blizzards or high winds. Veteran climbers and industry leaders blame having too many people on the mountain, in general, and too many inexperienced climbers, in particular. Fly-by-night adventure companies are taking up untrained climbers who pose a risk to everyone on the mountain. And the Nepalese government, hungry for every climbing dollar it can get, has issued more permits than Everest can safely handle, some experienced mountaineers say. Add to that Everest’s inimitable appeal to a growing body of thrill-seekers the world over. And the fact that Nepal, one of Asia’s poorest nations and the site of most Everest climbs, has a long record of shoddy regulations, mismanagement and corruption. The result is a crowded, unruly scene reminiscent of “Lord of the Flies” — at 29,000 feet. At that altitude, there is no room for error and altruism is put to the test. [Update: Nepal says Everest rules might change after traffic jams and deaths.] To reach the summit, climbers shed every pound of gear they can and take with them just enough canisters of compressed oxygen to make it to the top and back down. It is hard to think straight that high up, climbers say, and a delay of even an hour or two can mean life or death. According to Sherpas and climbers, some of the deaths this year were caused by people getting held up in the long lines on the last 1,000 feet or so of the climb, unable to get up and down fast enough to replenish their oxygen supply. Others were simply not fit enough to be on the mountain in the first place. Some climbers did not even know how to put on a pair of crampons, clip-on spikes that increase traction on ice, Sherpas said. Nepal has no strict rules about who can climb Everest, and veteran climbers say that is a recipe for disaster. “You have to qualify to do the Ironman,” said Alan Arnette, a prominent Everest chronicler and climber. “But you don’t have to qualify to climb the highest mountain in the world? What’s wrong with this picture?” The last time 11 or more people died on Everest was in 2015, during an avalanche. By some measures, the Everest machine has only gotten more out of control. Last year, veteran climbers, insurance companies and news organizations exposed a far-reaching conspiracy by guides, helicopter companies and hospitals to bilk millions of dollars from insurance companies by evacuating trekkers with minor signs of altitude sickness. Climbers complain of theft and heaps of trash on the mountain. And earlier this year, government investigators uncovered profound problems with some of the oxygen systems used by climbers. Climbers said cylinders were found to be leaking, exploding or being improperly filled on a black market. CHINA HIMALAYAS TIBET MT. EVEREST NEPAL Kathmandu 100 miles INDIA By The New York Times But despite complaints about safety lapses, this year the Nepali government issued a record number of permits, 381, as part of a bigger push to commercialize the mountain. Climbers say the permit numbers have been going up steadily each year and that this year the traffic jams were heavier than ever. “This is not going to improve,” said Lukas Furtenbach, a guide who recently relocated his climbers to the Chinese side of Everest because of the overcrowding in Nepal and the surge of inexperienced climbers. “There’s a lot of corruption in the Nepali government,” he said. “They take whatever they can get.” Nepali officials denied any wrongdoing and said the trekking companies were the ones responsible for safety on the mountain. Danduraj Ghimire, the director general of Nepal’s department of tourism, said in an interview on Sunday that the large number of deaths this year was not related to crowds, but because there were fewer good weather days for climbers to safely summit. He said the government was not inclined to change the number of permits. “If you really want to limit the number of climbers,” Mr. Ghimire said, “let’s just end all expeditions on our holy mountain.” To be sure, the race to the top is driven by the weather. May is the best time of the year to summit, but even then there are only a few days when it is clear enough and the winds are mild enough to make an attempt at the top. But one of the critical problems this year, veterans say, seems to be the sheer number of people trying to reach the summit at the same time. And since there is no government traffic cop high on the mountain, the task of deciding when groups get to attempt their final ascent is left up to mountaineering companies. [In 2016, three Indian climbers died on Everest. In 2017, a team sought to recover the two bodies that had been abandoned.] Climbers themselves, experienced or not, are often so driven to finish their quest that they may keep going even if they see the dangers escalating. A few decades ago, the people climbing Everest were largely experienced mountaineers willing to pay a lot of money. But in recent years, longtime climbers say, lower-cost operators working out of small storefronts in Kathmandu, the capital, and even more expensive foreign companies that don’t emphasize safety have entered the market and offered to take just about anyone to the top. Sometimes these trips go very wrong. From interviews with several climbers, it seems that as the groups get closer to the summit, the pressures increase and some people lose their sense of decency. Fatima Deryan, an experienced Lebanese mountaineer, was making her way to the summit recently when less experienced climbers started collapsing in front of her. Temperatures were dropping to -30 Celsius. Oxygen tanks were running low. And roughly 150 people were packed together, clipped to the same safety line. “A lot of people were panicking, worrying about themselves — and nobody thinks about those who are collapsing,” Ms. Deryan said. “It is a question of ethics,” she said. “We are all on oxygen. You figure out that if you help, you are going to die.” She offered to help some of the sick people, she said, but then calculated she was beginning to endanger herself and kept going to the summit, which is currently measured at 29,029 feet. On the way back down, she had to fight her way again through the crowds. “It was terrible,” she said. Around the same time, Rizza Alee, an 18-year-old climber from Kashmir, a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, was making his way up the mountain. He said he was stunned by how little empathy people had for those who were struggling. “I saw some people like they had no emotions,” he said. “I asked people for water and no one gave me any. People are really obsessed with the summit. They are ready to kill themselves for the summit.” But Mr. Alee himself took some chances; he has a heart condition and says he “kind of lied” to his expedition company when they asked if he had any health issues. Mr. Dohring, the American doctor, represents the other end of the spectrum. At 62, he has climbed peaks all over the world. He read about explorers as a boy and said he had always wanted to get to the “one spot where you can stand higher than any place else on earth.’’ To prepare for Everest, he slept at home in a tent that simulated high-altitude conditions. His total Everest experience cost $70,000. Still, there was only so much he could prepare for. Last month, when he hiked into base camp at Everest at an altitude of more than 17,000 feet, Mr. Dohring said he was overcome with awe. “You look at a circle of mountain peaks above you and think, ‘What am I doing here?’’’ he said. He pressed on. After long, cold days, he inched up a spiny trail to the summit early on Thursday and ran into crowds “aggressively jostling for pictures.” He was so scared, he said, that he plunked down on the snow to keep from losing his balance and had his guide take a picture of him holding up a small sign that said, “Hi Mom Love You.’’ On the way down, he passed two more dead bodies in their tents. “I was not prepared to see sick climbers being dragged down the mountain by Sherpas or the surreal experience of finding dead bodies,” he said. But on Sunday, he had made it out. He boarded a helicopter after reaching base camp and flew back to Kathmandu. He counted his blisters at the Yak and Yeti Hotel, where he said he treated himself to a thick steak and cracked open a cold beer. “Everest Lager, of course,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘It’s Like the Wild West’: Sexual Assault Victims Struggle in K-12 Schools,"WINCHESTER, Va. — Nausea had consumed her as her attacker pinned her arms down at a park, forced her first kiss upon her, and tried to take off her pants at the tender age of 14, and nausea resurfaced every time she saw him in the hallways of her high school. For a year, the girl had tried to convey the lingering trauma of the attack to disbelieving school officials as they investigated her claims. Then over the summer, they brought her to a conference room at the Winchester Public Schools building to watch a surveillance tape in which she was seen zigzagging in and out of hallways trying to avoid him and seek help. She thought she had made a breakthrough. Weeks later, the district issued its final report. Among its findings: She could not possibly be in distress because in one segment, she had smiled minutes after she saw her attacker. “That’s when I realized that instead of investigating my complaint, they were investigating me,” the girl, now 15, said in an interview. Efforts by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to overhaul federal rules on sexual misconduct have focused public attention on college campuses, where assault, rape and harassment have made headlines for years. But her efforts to change those rules, put into place more protections for the accused and offer relief for educational institutions have prompted concerns from elementary and secondary school leaders, public school superintendents and other educators that highlight how schools grapple with sexual misconduct involving much younger students. The new rules would apply to any elementary and secondary school district that receives government funding, hundreds of which — like Winchester — are already under investigation by the department’s Office for Civil Rights over claims of violating Title IX, the 47-year federal law to prevent sex discrimination in education. And where universities have procedures and adjudication processes that might need changing to comply with the new rules, elementary and secondary schools have been found to have no rules at all for dealing with sexual misconduct. The Education Department is currently investigating 652 complaints of Title IX violations related to sexual harassment and violence, 279 of which are against K-12 schools. “It’s like the Wild West,” said Adele P. Kimmel, a senior lawyer at Public Justice, a legal watchdog group. “K-12 schools are light years behind colleges.” The nation’s 98,000 public elementary and secondary schools educate 50 million children — nearly triple the number of young adults in colleges, universities and other postsecondary education facilities. And K-12 schools — often unaware of their obligations under federal law — have become notorious for failing to recognize and address sexual assault, and employing tactics to intimidate victims and avoid lawsuits. “Across the country we still sit in the bad old days where K-12 school administrators can convince themselves and persist in the belief that they do not have Title IX responsibility,” said Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights under the Obama administration and investigated a sharp rise in Title IX complaints concerning sexual violence in elementary and secondary schools. Under the Trump administration’s proposed regulations, schools would be expected to recognize complaints under Title IX only where harassment is “severe and pervasive,” and could decline to investigate claims that happen off campus or outside the school’s programming. The rules would no longer explicitly define how schools should address a “hostile environment” for accusers. The department is processing more than 100,000 comments submitted on the proposed regulations. Among them are those from groups representing K-12 principals, superintendents and school boards, all opposing the rules, which they say could further tie their hands in how they respond to sexual assault complaints from a vulnerable population. “Title IX compliance is challenging in the K-12 space,” said Sasha Pudelski, the advocacy director at AASA, the School Superintendents Association, “but nothing in these proposed regulations will make those challenges go away.” Under the proposed rules, the Winchester Public Schools district would not have been obligated to investigate the girl’s complaint at all, since she said the assault happened off campus. The girl’s mother, Danielle Bostick, said that even though the boy pleaded no contest to misdemeanor sexual battery and felony abduction and agreed to a protective order, the school denied the family’s claims of assault and of a hostile environment. The New York Times does not identify victims of sexual assault; the girl’s mother, who has a different last name, has spoken out about the case. The school devised a plan to minimize contact between Ms. Bostick’s daughter and the accused, but her requests that they have zero contact and that he ultimately be removed from the school were rebuffed. After losing two Title IX appeals, the girl transferred to a private school nearly an hour away. The Virginia state legislature recently passed a bill named after her that would protect students with protective orders in school. “Every choice those adults made was devastating to her,” said Ms. Bostick, who teaches Latin at the school. “There was nothing we could do, nothing we could show that would make them have compassion for her. The proposed changes would make our nightmare the new standard.” Jason Van Heukelum, the superintendent for the school district, said its conclusion was based on two exhaustive weekslong investigations that included reviewing nearly 1,300 pages of documents and conducting 17 interviews. “We go to great lengths to afford our students and staff protections from the violation and the fear of assault and harassment in our schools,” he said. Though colleges get the attention, it was a K-12 case that spurred the Supreme Court to expand the law to include student-on-student assaults. In 2016, the Obama administration issued guidance to K-12 schools as part of its overhaul of campus rules on sexual assault. The administration had seen a jump in sexual violence complaints in K-12 systems, to 83 in 2016 from 11 in 2009. Even then, advocates and civil rights officials believed those numbers were grossly underreported, because school districts failed to recognize when children were articulating sexual harassment. “If you don’t recognize sexual violence, you’re going to perpetuate it,” Ms. Kimmel said. The Obama administration’s investigations into K-12 systems revealed some of the most egregious violations, Ms. Lhamon said. She said the civil rights office often encountered a “school’s insistence that they didn’t need to have standards because students shouldn’t be having sex.” The Trump administration is trying to standardize proceedings that align with processes that court rulings have affirmed. And it has continued to aggressively pursue investigations and resolution agreements with K-12 school districts. Last year, the administration withheld millions of dollars in funding from Chicago Public Schools after The Chicago Tribune found that the school system had covered up rampant sexual abuse by students and staff members. Colleges and universities have fretted that bolstered rights for the accused under Ms. DeVos’s draft rules would force them to set up the equivalent of courtrooms, complete with prosecutors, defense lawyers and cross-examinations. But advocates say the Education Department should be cautious about how the rules would overhaul procedures in K-12 schools. In a letter to the department, Public Justice said the proposed rules would “hobble Title IX enforcement, placing a premium on protecting schools from legal liability instead of protecting students from harm,” and cement some of the worst practices already employed in K-12 proceedings. For instance, the proposals call for “a live hearing” during which accusers and accused students would be questioned with the goal of challenging each other’s credibility. Schools could choose to use a higher evidentiary standard than is required in civil court cases. And they would be in violation of the law only if they had done nothing to address the misconduct, or acted with “deliberate indifference,” regardless of the process or outcome. Public Justice is representing several clients across the country who say that a lack of procedures have led school districts to botch investigations and violate students’ rights under Title IX. In a lawsuit against Gwinnett County Public Schools in suburban Atlanta, a high school sophomore said she was punished after she reported that she was forced to perform oral sex on a male student. A staff member who helped lead the investigation said, “I don’t know that I’m trained to qualify what is sexual assault,” the suit said. The investigation required her to re-enact the episode. “Why didn’t you bite his penis?” a school resource officer asked her, according to the suit. During a disciplinary hearing, the girl was cross-examined by the accused student’s lawyer, who had to be told to “tone it down.” A lawyer for the school district also questioned the girl, concluding that he believed the encounter was consensual because she “did not scream louder and louder as this was going on.” Found to have violated the sexual misconduct policy, the girl was suspended — twice. A county spokeswoman referred to the district’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, in which it argued the school district did not violate Title IX because it investigated and determined the sex was consensual. In another case, parents are suing the Washington Public Schools in Oklahoma, where they say their middle-school son had been assaulted three times over 18 months by his male peers, who shoved their fingers in his rectum in a classroom and locker room. Administrators called it “horseplay” but admitted they would have called the police if the same action had been done to a girl. When the parents asked the administrators to take action, the principal, who was also the athletic director, asked, “What do you want me to do — hold his hand?” County officials did not respond to a request for comment. Jesse Binnall, a lawyer representing an accused student in a Title IX lawsuit against Fairfax County Schools in Virginia, said that there are even fewer due process protections at the K-12 level than in college, but school disciplinary decisions are more consequential for younger students. “This isn’t something you learn from and move on; this is almost worse than a felony conviction,” he said. “If you’re going to put something on somebody’s record, something that’s going to haunt them for the rest of their lives, you’d better be sure.” In Mr. Binnall’s suit, an 18-year-old male student says the school district violated his rights when he was suspended after a girl accused him of hitting her buttocks. The suit said the student had little notice to prepare a defense in a disciplinary hearing and was not able to question the accuser or the witnesses. The suit also contends that school officials ignored key evidence, and even though video evidence exonerated him and a witness recanted, they did not waive their decision. Officials in Fairfax County Schools, which is facing at least one other Title IX lawsuit, declined to comment on pending litigation. In 2014, the district settled an investigation with the Office for Civil Rights, which required it to improve its Title IX process. A spokesman said the district was complying with its federal agreement and federal laws and was “committed to continually improving our practices related to preventing and responding to sex discrimination within our schools.” For students like his client, Mr. Binnall said, Ms. DeVos’s new rules could be a step in the right direction. They outline extensive due process requirements that schools should follow, including proper notice to allow students to prepare for hearings, and providing equal opportunity to present witnesses and review evidence. “It’s not that we have to have full courtroom procedures,” he said. “We need to have procedures in place that make it so that some sort of teenage vendetta doesn’t completely ruin the lives of an innocent student. And that’s what’s really lacking at all levels right now, especially the K-12 level.”",The New York Times
2019,‘It’s Unnatural? Absolutely.’,"Just in time for its enshrinement in the Met, six experts debate camp, that celebration of artifice and exaggeration. CreditCreditVincent Tullo for The New York Times Looking back on his life and career in “The Glass of Fashion” in 1954, Cecil Beaton, the society photographer and social fixture, reported a curious incident sometime in the 1930s. “Hearty naval commanders or jolly colonels,” he wrote, “acquired the ‘camp’ manners of calling everything from Joan of Arc to Merlin ‘lots of fun,’ and the adjective ‘terrible’ peppered into every sentence.” 143 Photos View Slide Show › It wasn’t terrible, but it was camp. Camp, in this sense, is not a pup tent, but a circus tent: not an activity, but a way to see, a gimlet-eyed but eyebrow-cocked gloss on the world. To the connoisseur of camp, the world is a stage, artifice trumps art, and exaggeration rarely goes far enough. It is, in the words of the critic Susan Sontag, whose 1964 “Notes on Camp” became its codex and its decoder ring (and in so doing, made its author’s reputation), “a vision of the world in terms of style.” Camp, she wrote, “sees everything in quotation marks”; it “converts the serious into the frivolous.” It is a feint and a frolic. It’s “terrible,” with a giggle. (“You’re terrible, Muriel!”) Sontag did not invent camp. The word has been recorded since the very beginning of the 20th century, and the concept has likely been with us much longer, but she brought what had been an esoteric, private code, used largely by and among gay men, into the open air. (From the Oxford English Dictionary’s first documented use of “camp,” in a 1909 dictionary of Victorian slang: “Used chiefly by persons of exceptional want of character.”) Having been brought into the open, camp has coursed into general use, and what was marginal has gone mainstream. Camp has inflected art, fashion, film, TV and design, even if what does and doesn’t qualify remains a subject of furious debate. In 1968, Esther Newton wrote of her study of drag queens that “this ethnography is a map of terra incognita as far as most middle class social scientists are concerned”; now RuPaul is not only in vogue, but in Vogue. Next week “Camp: Notes on Fashion” will open at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with its famous celebrity-stuffed gala as ribbon cutting. As it does, it’s fair to wonder: Is camp still “lots of fun” when everyone’s on board, aboveboard? The “fugitive sensibility” Sontag hoped to capture is now enshrined in the museum. So, whither camp? And are we any closer to agreeing on what it is? On the occasion of the new exhibition, The New York Times invited six individuals whose work or study has touched camp or been touched by it, to discuss. James Bidgood, 86, is a photographer and filmmaker whose work — from early phantasmagoric beefcake photography to “Pink Narcissus,” an erotic film anonymously released in 1971 — is the subject of “James Bidgood: Reveries,” a retrospective running through Sept. 8 at the Museum of Sex. Charles Busch, 64, is an actor, playwright and cabaret performer, often in drag. His credits include “Vampire Lesbians of Sodom” (Off Broadway) and “The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife” (Broadway). His play “The Confession of Lily Dare” comes to Primary Stages in January. Jack Halberstam, 57, is a professor in the department of English and comparative literature and the Institute for Research on Women, Gender and Sexuality at Columbia University. Dr. Halberstam is the author of “Female Masculinity,” “Gaga Feminism” and “Trans*: A Quick and Quirky Account of Gender Variability.” Parker Kit Hill, 23, is a dancer, performer and model. His short videos attracted an audience of one million on the mobile platform Vine. He now works, as himself and in character as “Parklynn,” primarily on Instagram. Carmelita Tropicana, 68, the alter ego of the Cuban-American performance artist Alina Troyano, is a veteran of the New York alternative theater scene and the subject of the short film “Carmelita Tropicana: Your Kunst Is Your Waffen” by Ela Troyano. Zaldy, 52, a fashion and costume designer who has created tour outfits for Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Michael Jackson, is best known for his long collaboration with RuPaul and “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” for which he has won two Emmy Awards. We’ve all come here today to discuss the most important, most frivolous topic: What is camp? I’m interested to know if camp is something that has, in fact, inflected your work, and if it has changed from the way it used to be discussed in the ’50s and ’60s. James: When he talks about the past, he looks at me. Charles: I’m just so relieved. I thought that I was the oldest one here, but then I saw you and, thought, “Oh, thank God.” Jack: I was rereading the Sontag essay in preparation for this, and I do think that camp is a sensibility, an aesthetic sensibility. I would imagine it really derived from gay culture, gay male culture initially, and then has widened through every different group. Sontag starts with Oscar Wilde, which is a reasonable place to start because he was such a funny commentator on the unnatural. At the time, people wouldn’t have necessarily expressed their antipathy to same-sex sexuality through what we call homophobia, but they would have said, “This is unnatural.” And so, you could say that one of the foundational gestures of camp is to say, “It’s unnatural? Absolutely.” Zaldy: The term was in black and white in the dictionary in the last century, but camp and its queer roots have been there as far back as it goes. It’s just … camp. I mean, imagine Roman orgies — that’s camp! That is full-on camp. Charles: If we were back at the Roman orgy, it’d be our perception of it as opposed to somebody else’s. Maybe a heterosexual person at the Roman orgy might just be going at it from purely the sex angle, but if we were there, we’d be amused at the look of it, or the person who’s posing and looks foolish because they want to be something that they actually are not. I think an element of camp is what the truth is and what the perception is, when they’re two different things. That’s where often the humor comes in. Carmelita: I also think that it’s really important to put women in. I came from the ’80s, but women were also dressing up and were also acting out in cabaret around that time. Maybe they were not as visible. James: I think they’re all stretching it all too far. It’s just a word that meant exaggerated, too much for the occasion. Susan Sontag did so much writing about nothing, she made a big patootie about something that was a minimal thing and that really defies definition. Carmelita: Maybe it’s better to say, “This is the type of camp that I do.” James: The way you appear right now is camp. Carmelita: Exactly. James: But until you put the boobs on, it wasn’t! That’s what camp is. It’s doing something outrageous and over the top. That’s what camp was. I don’t understand what camp is anymore. Parker, does “camp” mean something different to you? Is it even a consideration you have? We’re talking about its origins, but not as much about its present. Parker: Well, being 23, I’m just now learning about camp, so camp to me is just self-expression. It can be that I dress up like a woman, or I dress up like a dog, or I dress up as a house, or something that’s just super over the top and not me. I don’t want to be like myself. Zaldy: The idea of camp is more around us now than ever, but we would never refer to it as camp. We just don’t use the word. Jack: It’s lost its resistant edge. At the point that it becomes a show at the Met sponsored by Gucci, let’s be clear that we are not in open rebellion. At that point, whoever defines themselves as camp has entered the mainstream with a flourish. I’d love to hear what you all think about that. If camp began as a kind of private language, it is now, I think, the lingua franca of pop culture — along with irony. I mean, so many things are camp. We were talking just before about the Kardashians … Charles: What’s the difference between just pop culture and camp? I’m not quite sure. Why are the Kardashians camp? James: I don’t think the Kardashians are camp at all. Zaldy: If you think of the level of artifice of what it is to be a Kardashian — like, somehow, miraculously, they all look exactly the same now. They’ve all been sculpted to look like a Kardashian and that, to me, is so camp. James: Doesn’t camp have to make you giggle at least? Camp, to me, is like a wife going to her husband’s funeral wearing a Day-Glo orange dress and a big feather boa on her head. Jack: There are certain things that we probably would agree on as camp that have now disappeared into the mainstream, far removed from any kind of subversive, queer culture. They could still be funny, but the question is, is there a sting to them the way that there is when you watch the queens in “Paris Is Burning,” for example? That kind of camp is very pointedly a critique, not just of the fashion world but of the cultural appropriation that the fashion world engages in when it basically is mocking and stealing from Latinos and black gay men, and then calling it high fashion. We could talk about cultural appropriation, I think. Parker: I don’t understand why people don’t get it yet, or why it’s taken so long with cultural appropriation. When are we going to get the proper recognition for it? Because it’s authentic to us, you know. Carmelita: I really like hybridity, that’s what I think of. Mixing everything into something. I am Cuban American, a Latina lesbian, a woman of color — all those things are brought in. I’m very happy that I came, in the ’80s, to New York to find the WOW Café. I studied theater, but this was a totally different world, and being open to what was going on at that time gave me a camp sensibility without me having read Susan Sontag. I didn’t create thinking of camp, it was just in the culture. I wasn’t thinking, “Oh yes, I’m going to do this because it fits this theory, or this is what’s going on.” I think that’s an interesting question: Do any of you now think about camp consciously when you’re making work? Is this something that just sort of occurs, or is it something that you pursue? Zaldy: Well, maybe more in my work because I create costumes — it just goes hand in hand. If I’m working with Ru, there’s a level of camp, just because RuPaul is RuPaul, and what Ru does is camp. Working with Cirque du Soleil is camp. In a way, it always comes up. I don’t really think about it, it’s just a part of how I was raised, what my outlook is, what my references are. But I would never describe myself as camp, even when I was doing drag. I’m curious about the way that camp sensibility is passed down. For all of you, is it something that you absorbed from mentors or environments you were in? Or does it have to be taught? Zaldy: Watching all those classic ’60s and ’70s variety shows, they were all so camp. Camp imagery was just part of my life. Benny Hill. “Hee Haw.” Everything was camp. Cher, Carol Burnett, that was camp. “The Brady Bunch,” “The Partridge Family,” camp, camp, camp. James: Was “Valley of the Dolls” camp? Carmelita: So much. James: I don’t think you can just do a bad movie and call it camp. That’s just a bad movie. Unless they went and said, “We’re going to do this camp,” then it’s just that nobody knew what they were doing. But I’m out of place here. I’m, like, 2,000 years old, and what camp was back in the Stone Age is totally different. ... I mean, I don’t know what anyone’s talking about! Was camp part of your understanding of what you were doing? Parker: I feel like my inspiration from it, and the way it came into my life, is through musical theater and ballet. It was like I was taught camp without really knowing what it was, because I was becoming these characters, doing “Romeo and Juliet,” “Swan Lake.” Charles: Certainly there’s a camp element to my work, and I’m part of a tradition. I was influenced by Charles Ludlam, and I guess there are people who are influenced by me. We step on each other’s shoulders in a very good way. I’ve sometimes felt that straight press, and even gay press, has sometimes limited me by trying to define anything I do as camp, but there’s certainly large camp elements to my work. Sometimes I can’t really define it myself. Parker: Yeah, and I think that is the kind of camp that I have. It’s just something I can’t define, it’s just there. We’re talking a lot about the past. Do we need distance to understand camp? Is it easier to be camp about an old movie actress, a ballet role from the repertoire? Charles: I would have thought, yet actually listening to this conversation, it’s opening my eyes a bit. I really do think that every generation has the stuff from five years before that they grew up on — whether it’s the ’80s for you, or the ’60s for you. For me, being a teenager in the ’60s, I’m referencing the things I watched —  old movies from the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s, but I’m seeing them on TV, on the 4:30 p.m. movie after school. The past for each generation is a very different place, and that’s the point. Jack: What if we had a critique of camp, how about that? I’m not somebody who thinks that camp is all that. In fact, in my work I’ve critiqued it as being this sort of canonization of a certain set of cultural expressions, often by white gay men, that then stands in for all of gay culture. I think that what we’ve seen with camp is the movement from the margins of society — being critiqued, and then using camp to answer back — to the mainstream. Like “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,” it’s now just mainstream TV. It’s just a mode of making money. When you have five gay men on a cable-TV channel telling everyone how to dress, what products to use, at that point how is it not just capitalism? I think that’s a convincing critique. What about on the other side? Are there reasons to celebrate the arrival of camp into the mainstream, or at least into the Met? Charles: I think the positive thing about the exhibit — and I haven’t seen it — but I think how wonderful to see the costumes of these great figures of the past that have real artistic merit. It’s a great aesthetic, and it’d be wonderful to give it one more viewing. Jack: I personally don’t think there’s much left of camp. I really don’t. I think the fact that it’s in a museum tells us this is pretty much a punctuation mark at the end of an interesting conversation. Carmelita: I wouldn’t say just put the nail in the coffin for camp, because I’m really excited about the young generation. I’m looking for Parker in the future of camp. Charles: Do we all get to go to the gala because we participated in this?",The New York Times
2019,‘I’m Really Opening Myself Up’: Chelsea Manning Signs Book Deal,"WASHINGTON — Ever since she was publicly identified as the source who had disclosed a huge trove of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks in 2011, Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst, has been a polarizing cultural figure — called a traitor by prosecutors, but celebrated as an icon by transparency and antiwar activists. Her life story, and her role in one of the most extraordinary leaks in American history, has been told in news articles, an Off Broadway play and even an opera. But while she spoke at her court-martial and has participated in interviews, Manning herself has not told her own story, until now. Manning is writing a memoir, which Farrar, Straus and Giroux will publish in the winter of 2020, the publisher announced Monday. Manning was convicted in 2013 and sentenced to 35 years in prison, the longest sentence ever handed down in an American leak case. After her conviction, Manning announced that she was a transgender woman and changed her name to “Chelsea,” although the military housed her in a Fort Leavenworth prison for male inmates. She had a difficult time there, attempting suicide twice in 2016, before President Barack Obama commuted most of the remainder of her sentence shortly before he left office in January 2017. In the meantime, WikiLeaks published Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers during the 2016 presidential campaign, transforming its image from what it had been back when Manning decided to send archives of secret files to it. Manning reappeared in the news this year, refusing to testify before a grand jury as federal prosecutors continue to build a case against Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder. Assange, currently in custody in Britain, is fighting extradition to the United States for a charge that he conspired with Manning to try to crack an encoded password that would have permitted her to log onto a classified computer network under a different person’s account rather than her own, which would have helped her mask her tracks better. She was jailed for two months for contempt over her refusal to answer questions about her interactions with Assange, then freed because the grand jury expired. But she has already been served with a new subpoena prosecutors obtained from a new grand jury and is expected to be jailed again soon. Below are edited excerpts from a conversation between Manning and Charlie Savage, a New York Times reporter who has written about her court-martial and her time in military prison. Tell me about your book. It’s basically my life story up until I got the commutation, from my birth to my time in school and going to the army and going to prison and the court-martial process. It’s a personal narrative of what was going on in my life surrounding that time and what led to the leaks, what led to prison, and how this whole ordeal has really shaped me and changed me. I view this book as a coming-of-age story. For instance, how my colleagues in the intelligence field really were the driving force behind my questioning of assumptions that I had come into the military with — how jaded they were, some of them having done two three four deployments previously. And then also there is a lot of stuff about how prisons are awful, and how prisoners survive and get through being in confinement. Do you have a title yet? There is no title yet. I am trying very hard to have some control over that, but none has been decided yet. Noreen Malone from New York magazine worked on it with me. She did a lot of the groundwork in terms of the research, and I did the storytelling, so it was a collaborative effort. I’m still going through and editing where she has taken independent sources to help refine my story, fact-check, verify things and provide a third-person perspective in shaping things. Is it written in first-person or third-person? It is written in first-person, but there are parts of the book that reference material that are independent of me. I’m still under obligation under the court rules and the Classified Information Procedures Act of 1980 to not disclose closed court-martial testimony or verify evidence that was put in the record. Things like that. So I can’t talk about that stuff and I’m not going to, and so I’m trying to keep this and maintain this as more of a personal story. There are parts of it that might reference reports or whatnot but I’m just going to say, “the media reported this, but I’m not confirming or denying it.” Are you going to submit the manuscript to the government for a classified information review? We’re trying our best to avoid the review process. There is a lot of stuff that is not going to be in the book that people would expect to be in there, but rules are rules and we can’t get around it. It’s more about personal experiences I had rather than anything specific. I’m not trying to relitigate the case, just tell my personal story. So if it ends with you getting out of military prison, you’re not going to address your current situation with the grand jury investigating WikiLeaks? No, we’re not planning on including that in this current stage. If there is a book that gets into the more juicy details about that stuff, then we’ll probably get around to that after going through a review process, several years down the road from now, whenever the dust settles. But I think this is more about trying to contextualize my story from my perspective rather than get into the weeds of what is in the record of trial, what is in the documents, what the investigation focused on, because we’re just not able to get into that area. It sounds like you are a lot freer to talk about your gender identity than the WikiLeaks issue. Yeah. This is less a book about the case and more a book about trials, tribunals, struggles, difficulties, and overcoming them and surviving. If people are expecting to learn a lot more about the court-martial and a lot more about the case, then they probably shouldn’t be interested in this book. But if they want to know more about what it’s like to be me and survive, then there are reams of information in here. It’s much more autobiographical than it is a narrative thriller or crime story or anything like that. I have always pitched this to being very similar to “Wild” by Cheryl Strayed. I’m really opening myself up to some really intimate things in this book, some really very personal moments and much more intimate points of my life that I’ve never disclosed before. You’re probably going to learn more about my love life than about the disclosures.",The New York Times

On a Sunday afternoon in his Brooklyn neighborhood, Greenpoint, Mr. Person — looking more Merlin than Harry Potter, with his plush robe and scraggly white beard — led about three dozen people in meditation. He encouraged them to “sample the flavors and energy of each cloud formation as if you were walking around Costco’s different free sample stations,” to float “like Michael Phelps diving into the pool” and to wear a smile “like the sun on the Raisin Bran box.” As a modern “wizard,” Mr. Person, 33, holds group sessions, like the recent meditation and Wizarding Hour in Greenpoint. He speaks to companies. He officiates weddings. He reads tarot and performs hypnosis. He hosts a podcast. He once planned an “edible enhanced” walkabout in Central Park. He will also show up if someone wants to “have fun hanging out with a wizard.” He generally charges $150 for a one-on-one meeting, or $400 to $500 to create a ritual, but sometimes offers services pro bono. “I try to think, ‘What would a wizard do in the modern era?’” he said. In recent years, new-age pursuits — crystals, sound baths, astrology — have shed their stigma and seemingly become ubiquitous among swaths of city dwellers. Even venture capitalists are putting money into what one investor called the “mystical services market.” It is in this environment that Mr. Person, the zany kind of character who makes New York distinctive, offers his services with a hefty wink. He would not disclose his “wizarding” salary, but said, “I do other work so I don’t have to distort my magic into an endless sales pitch.” “Wizards are people helpers,” he said. “They are who the hero encounters on their journey, and they’re able to give the hero a bit of advice, maybe a magical artifact, some sort of assistance that helps the hero get over their obstacle and on their journey.” Mr. Person had long been interested in the occult and spirituality when, in 2014, he decided to “hatch an egg” of something to pursue alongside his day job at the website creator Squarespace, now as an associate product manager. So, after making his way through an exhaustive list of new-age books, Mr. Person started holding “occult consulting” sessions with friends and friends of friends, eventually expanding to dozens and dozens of clients. He described his transformation as “reaching out through time and space and across the dimensional barrier to make contact with the most wizardly possibility of myself.” That meant, he said, functioning as a mentor and listener. (The word “wizard” comes from the Middle English “wys,” or “wise.”) Mr. Person posted on Facebook that he was offering coaching services. Not long after, a childhood friend from Indiana reached out. The friend, Sahil Bhatia, said he was “in a deep depression and crisis of faith.” The two men discussed strategies like “set five goals per day” that Mr. Bhatia could use to feel fulfilled. “The lower pressure and informal nature of it was much different,” Mr. Bhatia said. “That was really helpful to me.” Mr. Person stresses that he is not a therapist and that he generally offers just one session to participants, which he frames as, “This is the moment in your life where you encounter a wizard, and this has the potential to change a lot and we’re going to talk about it.” He added, “I’m weird, but I get results.” Quirk attracts quirk. Charles Philipp, a co-founder of Micro, which builds six-foot-tall museums, hired Mr. Person last year to appear at the company’s factory in Bushwick, Brooklyn. “There’s the idea and the gift of pulling people out of their daily routine,” Mr. Philipp said. “No one does that like a large bearded man in a pointed hat and a robe.” The clothing is a costume, but the facial hair is not. In 2015, a joint disease in Mr. Person’s left knee flared up. Doctors gave him medication, but there was a caveat: It would turn his dark-brown hair Santa Claus white. The perfect color locks for a wizard. “I started a tap dance in his office. I think he was surprised,” said Mr. Person, who also legally changed his last name as part of his new identity; it comes from the “Person is awake” line in New York City’s guide to helping someone who is choking. As a child, Mr. Person was “into the whimsicality of life,” his friend Mr. Bhatia recalled. “He would dress up, have his hair gelled up in some strange way, wear tacky sunglasses, clashing beach shorts, that kind of thing. Even then, I think he was dancing to the beat of his own drum.” At Squarespace, Mr. Person dresses in what he calls “wizness casual” or “urban Jedi” — kurta, kimono jackets and other flowing clothing. But during his commute, he sometimes dons his robe and hat, and offers “spells” to subway riders that range in theme from family and career to dating and health. The sign he hoists on the subway reads: “Talk to the wizard, because no one meets a wizard by accident.” Matt Levy and Jennifer MacFarlane, both native New Yorkers, spotted Mr. Person on a J train. “It was one of those magical things that doesn’t happen much in New York, especially on the train,” Ms. MacFarlane said. “Everyone is on their phone, but this opened up some other dimension. Everyone was chatting about deep, interesting things — their dreams, their wishes.” There are, of course, skeptics and those who feign indifference.

2019,"‘I’ve Battled,’ Tiger Woods Says as He Accepts Presidential Medal of Freedom","WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday awarded Tiger Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in a Rose Garden ceremony in which both men described the golfer’s athletic triumphs set against painful personal lows. “I’ve battled,” Woods, 43, said after the president fastened the medal around his neck. “I’ve tried to hang in there, and I’ve tried to come back and play the great game of golf again.” The fight Mr. Woods described was what Mr. Trump seemed to admire most. He cited the golfer’s “relentless will to win, win, win,” in a speech that traced in detail Mr. Woods’s career from his being named the PGA Tour’s rookie of the year in 1996 to his against-the-odds comeback with last month’s win at the Masters. “We can’t wait to see what’s next, Tiger,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Woods, a normally sedate figure who spent Monday’s ceremony grinning ear to ear. “There are no winners like you.” Mr. Woods’s Masters victory ended a nearly 11-year wait for his 15th major championship, during which he weathered a marital infidelity scandal that ended in divorce, a debilitating spine injury, an addiction to prescription painkillers and grave doubts about his athletic longevity. [Read more about the relationship between Tiger Woods and President Trump.] Throughout the years, as the president reminded the Rose Garden audience, Mr. Trump has cheered him on, particularly as he got to know Mr. Woods and his family through his own love of the sport. Mr. Trump and Mr. Woods have periodically played golf together, and Mr. Woods has agreed to design a course in Dubai as part of a luxury residential project managed by the Trump Organization. Mr. Woods’s business ties with Mr. Trump have invited scrutiny as ethics watchdogs point out that the president was presenting the Medal of Freedom to a business partner: “Tiger is a successful entrepreneur, to put it mildly,” Mr. Trump said. The president’s son Eric, who oversees the Trump Organization, was seated in the front row next to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. The Rose Garden ceremony also publicly rewarded a prominent athlete whose relationship with the president stands in contrast to that of African-American sports superstars like LeBron James and Stephen Curry who have staked out public stances against Mr. Trump. Some championship teams, or individual members, have declined to visit the White House for traditional title celebrations, particularly after the president called for sports teams to fire any player who joined in a growing protest of racial discrimination and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem. During Monday’s ceremony, Mr. Woods received a standing ovation and thanked the president for the honor before thanking his mother, Kultida, and his children, Sam and Charlie. Erica Herman, Mr. Woods’s girlfriend, and Joe LaCava, his longtime caddie, were also in the audience. “This has been an unbelievable experience,” Mr. Woods told the group of family, friends and supporters, which included Mr. Trump and much of his cabinet. “You’ve seen the good and the bad, the highs and the lows, and I would not be in this position without your help.” Like other presidents, Mr. Trump has awarded the medal to people sure to please his political base: Miriam Adelson, the Las Vegas physician and prominent Republican donor, has also received the award, as has the retired Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican from Utah. But unlike his predecessors, Mr. Trump has been upfront about rewarding people he feels have enthusiastically supported him. When awarding the medal to Mr. Hatch last year, Mr. Trump confirmed that reasoning: “He liked me from the very beginning, and therefore I like him,” adding, “I guess I’m not supposed to say it, but that’s the way life works, right?” In the past, Mr. Woods has offered words of mild support when approached by reporters about his relationship with Mr. Trump. “You have to respect the office,” Mr. Woods said when asked about it last August. “No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike the personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office.” When he was asked to further address the state of race relations in America, Mr. Woods declined, saying that he was “really hungry” after finishing 72 holes. Mr. Trump praised the golfer’s response, admonishing the “fake news media” for what he said was an attempt to get Mr. Woods to speak badly about him. “Tiger wouldn’t play the game,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter at the time. “He is very smart. More importantly, he is playing great golf again!” Mr. Woods was the fourth athlete to receive the Medal of Freedom from Mr. Trump. He joined the late Yankees slugger Babe Ruth; Alan C. Page, a Hall of Fame defensive tackle who became the first black judge on Minnesota’s Supreme Court; and Roger Staubach, a Hall of Fame quarterback and a Vietnam veteran. As Mr. Woods noted during his Rose Garden speech, he is the fourth golfer to have received the honor, after Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Charlie Sifford. After the ceremony, Mr. Nicklaus congratulated Mr. Woods on Twitter.",The New York Times
2019,‘Jeremy Kyle Show’ Canceled After Death of Guest,"LONDON — One of Britain’s most popular daytime television programs was canceled on Wednesday, following the death of a guest who failed a lie-detector test trying to prove that he had been faithful to his girlfriend. “Given the gravity of recent events we have decided to end production of ‘The Jeremy Kyle Show,’” Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of the show’s broadcaster, ITV, said in a statement. The incident has caused intense debate here about whether confrontational talk shows have any place on British TV, and on Wednesday the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of Parliament, Damian Collins, announced the start of an independent review of the responsibility that TV companies have to protect participants in reality shows. But some former guests have defended the show, saying it was being blamed unfairly for a tragedy and that the criticism raised issues of class. In the wake of the death, ITV on Monday had announced it was suspending “The Jeremy Kyle Show,” which had run for over 14 years and attracted about a million viewers per episode. Steve Dymond, 63, was found dead on May 9, a week after he recorded an episode of the show, which had not yet been broadcast. ITV and the British police have not released any details about the circumstances of the man’s death. But the suspension did not stop an outcry from politicians and therapists who said it was time to cancel the show. Even senior officials got involved. “Broadcasters and production companies have a responsibility for the mental health and well-being of participants and viewers,” a spokesperson for the British prime minister, Theresa May, told the BBC. Mr. Dymond’s death was far from the first controversy to engulf “The Jeremy Kyle Show,” which has often compared to “The Jerry Springer Show” in America. Lie-detector and DNA tests were a staple of the show, and in many episodes Mr. Kyle would take positions on his guest’s problems and openly — some said aggressively — criticize them. In 2007, a court fined a former guest $385 for head-butting a love rival. The judge in the case, Alan Berg, found fault as much with the show as with the attacker. “It seems to me that the purpose of this show is to effect a morbid and depressing display of dysfunctional people whose lives are in turmoil,” he wrote in his decision. The show was a “human form of bear baiting,” he added, saying its producers “should in my opinion be in the dock.” In 2008, a man pointed a loaded gun at his wife’s head a week after recording an episode of the show, according to The Observer, where he had learned he was not the father of their child. Similar incidents have been found in other talk shows worldwide. In 1995, “The Jenny Jones Show” was caught in a media storm after an episode on gay crushes in which one guest, Scott Amedure, admitted to his friend Jonathan Schmitz that he had a secret crush on him. Three days later, Mr. Schmitz murdered Mr. Amedure. The case was thought to be a turning point for tabloid TV in the United States. “The Jeremy Kyle Show” had survived its previous controversies, but the current one proved too much. “Now is the right time for the show to end,” Ms. McCall said in her statement. “I’m pleased, obviously,” Charles Walker, a conservative politician who led calls for the show’s cancellation, said in a telephone interview. “There’s been a degree of complacency among broadcasters” that “they can do pretty much what they like,” he added. “I don’t think that holds water anymore.” Honey Langcaster-James, a psychologist who has been hired to offer counseling to the participants on many reality shows, including ITV’s popular “Love Island,” said in a telephone interview that she hoped the network would not return to the format. “In this day and age of greater awareness of mental health, addiction and social and economic strain, I’d like to think they’d take that into account,” she said. Some have come to the show’s defense, including Deirdre Kelly, who came to attention in Britain after appearing on “Benefits Street,” a documentary series about people who needed government support. “A man has lost his life — that’s a tragedy in any circumstances,” Ms. Kelly said in a telephone interview. “But canceling the show permanently, I think is a bit of a mistake.” The show was not only concerned with tawdry topics, she said. It also reunited families, found help for addicts and told inspirational children’s stories. Danniella Westbrook, an actress and friend of Mr. Kyle, said in a telephone interview that the host was being made a scapegoat. She pointed out that several former contestants on “Love Island” had died by suicide. (In March, ITV issued a statement outlining the mental health services available to current and former “Love Island” contestants after one such death.) “I think a lot of it is class related — a lot of upper and middle classes banging on about ‘Broken Britain,’” Ms. Westbrook said of the criticism of “The Jeremy Kyle Show.” Ms. McCall’s statement said that ITV would continue to work with Mr. Kyle on other projects. Mr. Walker, the politician, said the calls to cancel the series were not patronizing its largely working-class audience or guests. “If people can’t look after themselves,” he said, “we have to look after them.” An earlier version of this article misstated in one instance the surname of the man who was found dead after taping an appearance on “The Jeremy Kyle Show.” He is Steve Dymond, not Dyson. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article mischaracterized the relationship between Steve Dymond and his former partner. She had been his girlfriend, not his wife.",The New York Times
2019,‘John Wick: Chapter 3’ Puts Keanu Reeves Back on Top at the Box Office,"LOS ANGELES — The third “John Wick” movie arrived to stronger-than-expected ticket sales, returning Keanu Reeves to the top of the box-office chart for the first time in 11 years and giving Lionsgate a much-needed shot in the arm. “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum,” which finds the title’s super-assassin (Reeves) on the run from other contract killers, collected about $57 million at theaters in the United States and Canada over the weekend, according to Comscore. The R-rated Lionsgate series has grown remarkably more powerful with each installment: “John Wick: Chapter 2” had $30 million in initial ticket sales in 2017, improving on the $15 million that “John Wick” collected over its first three days in 2014. That kind of audience expansion — extremely rare — is a dream result for Lionsgate, which has been struggling to turn around its movie operation, in part because Netflix has started to crank out the type of low- and mid-budget films in which Lionsgate has long specialized. Why go to theaters to see these diversions when Netflix is pumping them into your living room? [Read our review of “John Wick: Chapter 3” and check out the series’ best action scenes.] Last year, Lionsgate released 19 movies through various labels and took in a total of $379 million in North America, its worst showing since 2007. Lionsgate’s most recent releases, “Hellboy” and “Long Shot,” were both bombs. Tyler Perry delivered a hit in March with “A Madea Family Funeral,” but it was the last film that Mr. Perry intends to supply to Lionsgate, ending a 14-year run. He has a new alliance with Paramount. Lionsgate said on Sunday that “John Wick: Chapter 3” collected an additional $35 million in partial release overseas. The film received strong reviews from most critics. David Gross, who runs Franchise Entertainment Research, a movie consultancy, said the results put the series “on outstanding footing going forward” and said it was now “an elite action thriller franchise.” “John Wick: Chapter 3,” which stars Halle Berry in a supporting role, cost an estimated $75 million to make and roughly $40 million to market. The last time Reeves had a No. 1 opening was in 2008 with “The Day the Earth Stood Still.” Two other new wide-release movies sputtered in their debuts. (See: the Netflix effect.) “A Dog’s Journey,” an Amblin sequel that was released by Universal, collected $8 million in North America, or about 56 percent less than “A Dog’s Purpose” had in its first weekend in 2017. “A Dog’s Purpose” was a surprise hit, taking in a total of $205 million and spawning a boomlet in soft-edged dog movies. (Another one, “The Art of Racing in the Rain,” will arrive from Disney in August.) In a wipeout, “The Sun Is Also a Star,” a low-budget romantic drama starring Yara Shahidi and Charles Melton, was booked into more than 2,000 theaters by Warner Bros. and only managed $2 million in ticket sales.",The New York Times
2019,‘John Wick: Chapter 3’ Review: Keanu Reeves Is Back for Another Brutal Round,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum,” guns have more dialogue than its hero and more capacity than seems technically possible, the spraying of bullets interrupted mainly to showcase another lethal weapon. Even more than its predecessors, this third installment in the reluctant-assassin franchise is, like most modern action movies, perfectly attuned to the needs of the foreign markets where most of its money will be made. Bangs and grunts and body slams do not require subtitles. John himself (still embodied, to mechanistic perfection, by Keanu Reeves) is a man of so few words that he seems less the movie’s star than its wrecking ball — a human Cuisinart pulverizing an unending supply of foes. Their numbers are now legion, thanks to the multimillion-dollar bounty placed on John’s head by the global society of villains known as the High Table. Having broken its rules in the previous movie by offing someone in the criminal sanctuary known as the Continental Hotel, John has been excommunicated. Now, he’s off and running through a teeming, gleaming Manhattan night, every hot-dog seller and hobo his possible executioner. Dumb as dirt and twice as filling, “Chapter 3” is a symphony of dazzlingly sterile, cartoonish abuse. Directed once again by Chad Stahelski, the story travels to Casablanca and the Sahara as John calls in old markers and the movie racks up guest stars: Anjelica Huston as a scary trainer of ballerina-assassins; Halle Berry as a former acquaintance with very particularly skilled dogs. Yet many of its interactions, continuing the franchise’s emphasis on arcane ciphers and symbols, will mean little to those not already inducted into a war that kicked off two movies ago because of John’s murdered pooch. That first “John Wick” came along like a fluke — a shallow, sharp, shiny object with its own internal logic and idiosyncratic style. This time, the fight choreography is even more staggeringly accomplished: ridiculously sleek fandangos of destruction. A lengthy battle with a blade-happy sushi chef (the amazing Mark Dacascos) is mind-blowing; yet I’d have preferred more time among the tattooed, tight-skirted secretaries at High Table H.Q., messing with their vintage switchboard and John’s status updates. Clearly, that’s where the real work gets done. More and more, movies like this make me nostalgic for the days before franchises were virtually guaranteed, before every innovative idea had to be given a makeover, a pat on the behind and turned out to make more money. In “Chapter 3,” the violence has been supercharged, and so has the virtuosity. At a certain point, though, the carnage becomes deadening, its consequences no more than soulless tableaus of damage that encourage disengagement. Reeves, however, has finally found his home. His character might have been forced to mutilate his hand to repay a debt, but by Chapter 4 he’ll probably have mastered the harp. Or turned one into a weapon. “All of this, for what?” the ballet mistress asks a desperately wounded John. “Because of a puppy?” By the look on his face, she’d do well to believe it.

2019,"‘Joy’ Review: In Austria, a Nigerian Woman Finds a Life Without Hope","Streaming Movie Review The name of this Netflix feature is the precise opposite of its mood. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Although Netflix has a reputation as an escapist clearinghouse, the streaming service isn’t averse to the occasional tough sit. The Austrian film “Joy” — the title refers both to the main character’s name and the precise opposite of the film’s mood — follows a Nigerian woman (Joy Anwulika Alphonsus) who is trafficked illegally to Austria, where she works as a prostitute and sends money home. The film opens with a girl participating in a ceremony with a Juju priest who, we later learn, is essentially ensnaring her — making her think that disobedience in Europe will bring bad luck. In the first of several intelligently uninflected leaps in time or geography, the director, Sudabeh Mortezai, jumps from this scene in Nigeria to a title card and then to Austria. By now, Joy, who has undergone such a ritual, is an experienced streetwalker overseeing a newcomer, Precious (Precious Mariam Sanusi). The cycle is difficult to break: Joy and Precious’s madam (Angela Ekeleme Pius), who collects their debts over a period of years, pits her stable of women against one another (if Joy loses Precious while watching her, Joy assumes Precious’s financial obligations). And because testifying carries no guarantee of a visa, Joy has little incentive to blow the whistle in court. In such dire circumstances — Joy and Precious are each sexually assaulted during the film — is there room for kindness? Mortezai, who is said to have based her film on extensive research into and collaboration with women who knew this world, poses that question but, to her credit, doesn’t settle on an answer. The sisterhood among the madam’s prostitutes easily devolves into betrayal or indifference. Matching content with form, the movie is tight and merciless, even if parts play like a tract.

2019,‘Killing Eve’ Showrunner: ‘All Obsession Is Sexual’,"Emerald Fennell took over the BBC America thriller from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and brought her love of horror with her. This article contains spoilers for the BBC America show “Killing Eve.” Few pairs of shoes are as metaphorically large as those belonging to Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Between seasons of her internationally acclaimed comedy “Fleabag,” based on her breakout play, the British writer-actress-producer created one of 2018’s most celebrated shows, the cat-and-mouse thriller “Killing Eve.” Starring Sandra Oh as Eve, a bored MI5 operative, and Jodie Comer as Villanelle, a seductive assassin, the show’s first season collected Golden Globes, Baftas and a Peabody. Waller-Bridge announced last year that she was stepping down as showrunner, though she remains an executive producer. In an unusual move, each new season of “Killing Eve” will bring on a new female showrunner; the first since Waller-Bridge is Emerald Fennell, who produced the second season with the executive producer Sally Woodward Gentle. Like Waller-Bridge, Fennell, 33, is something of a polymath. She has published several novels and written for the British television comedy show “Drifters,” but she is arguably best known, at least in the United States, for playing Patsy on “Call the Midwife.” She will also play Camilla Parker-Bowles in the third season of Netflix’s “The Crown.” Under her oversight, the second season of “Killing Eve,” whose finale aired on Sunday, saw Eve surrendering to her obsession with Villanelle, while still maintaining what Fennell calls her “fanaticism” for righteousness. In a phone interview earlier this month, Fennell discussed how she was inspired by “Paradise Lost,” why the violent murder in the season finale was so necessary and how “Killing Eve” is honest about our dark desires. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How did you come to be involved in the show? Phoebe [Waller-Bridge] and I had worked together in the past, and we’ve been friends for nearly 10 years. We met on a film — “Albert Nobbs” — which we both had tiny parts in. I started in the very early days as a writer in the Season 2 writer’s room. Because it’s such an unusual show, they did a very loose writers’ room for a week just to see, and then wonderfully and luckily for me they promoted me to head writer. Having a new showrunner each season seems like a great way to give young women experience running a show. Oh my goodness, it’s unimaginable. Apart from the fact “Killing Eve” is so fascinating from a character point of view, you’re dealing with an action show in lots of ways, and so there’s lots of locations and all sorts of complicated technical production stuff. I didn’t think that I’d have the opportunity to work on something at such a big scale. It’s life-changing, really. It gives you so much confidence going forward. I think women in general, sometimes we can feel a bit hesitant to speak up and the confidence of saying “I know what I’m doing” is invaluable. One of the most remarkable things about the first season of “Killing Eve” was its tone: darkly funny and sexy, and so often surprising. How did you think about tone and sensibility in creating Season 2? Phoebe has made something so completely unique that the tone and voice is very particular, so this year we had to balance staying completely true to what Phoebe built and having it feel like its own thing. It helps enormously that I have a dark sense of humor myself. It’s different to Phoebe’s, of course, but all of the things I’ve worked on until now have been darkly horrible and darkly funny. When it comes down to it, if you love and are invested in the characters, it’s a matter of saying, O.K., where do I want to see these characters go? And so for me that is slightly more horror, which I think you get certainly in Episode 2 and it comes out a lot in Episode 8. In this season, Eve and Villanelle’s mutual obsession rages on, in ever more destructive ways, and yet the physical contact between them is so minimal, and we never see them have explicitly sexual interactions. I would go so far as to say that all obsession is sexual to some degree. There comes a point where even if you’re obsessed with a train set, there’s something going on. If you’re spending more time with your train set than your wife, what are you doing to that train? [Laughs.] There absolutely is a sexual component to the obsession, but this is also a show about Eve, who is an extraordinary woman but also an ordinary woman. Think of how difficult it would be to have an affair, how hideous that is, how people agonize over things like that. Then if the person you’re thinking about all the time is a murderer and murdered your best friend, there’s no sense to me that you would leap into bed with that person. Part of this season was about what it means to be faced with the object of your obsession, to be in their vicinity. Because the truth of it is that when they’re together, it’s very difficult for both of them. Of course there’s a huge amount of electricity, but there’s also a huge amount of complicated loathing. There’s all sorts of negative things that come too with this obsession. Eve is really not yet at a place where she’s become so cavalier and so detached from reality that she isn’t aware of how dangerous this whole thing is. For most of this second season Eve is laboring under a fantasy about what being close to Villanelle would be like, and then the murder in Episode 8 is such a wake-up call. We’re so used to seeing violence that we forget what it would feel like, but that’s why the murder in Episode 8 is so important. It is incredibly violent, and I think the audience needs to feel what it would be like to kill someone. It’s got to be unbelievably distressing and violent and horrible to kill someone if you don’t know what you’re doing. There’s an argument that it may feel too violent, but for me I think it’s actually much worse to show death in a way that just feels bloodless. It felt to me that this is how distressing it would be. This stuff is all incredibly sexy and compelling, but this is also what it is. Part of the show is about wish fulfillment, but a lot of this series for me is about saying, if you love Villanelle, which we all do because she’s heaven, can you still love her if she misunderstands a situation so much that she kills a child? We saw Eve really changing this season, moving closer and closer to Villanelle and her world. We all want Eve to go bad, but the pleasure of “Killing Eve,” for me, is showing it in a way that is far more honest and weird and distressing than what we expect. Because the truth is so much weirder and creepier, particularly for women, because we spend so much of our time hiding how we feel, particularly when it comes to sex and anger and all those kinds of dark emotions. What’s really driving Eve, beyond the obsession with Villanelle? She really, really believes in good versus evil in a very large and almost biblical way. And we talked a lot at the beginning of the creative process about “Paradise Lost” and about Eve being Eve, Carolyn [Fiona Shaw] being a cold God figure and Villanelle being the tempting snake. Eve is trying constantly to be good, and it just is unfortunate that that’s taken her full circle basically. And Niko, Eve’s husband, is such a good foil for her. He doesn’t have big designs to change the world, and yet his is definitely a quiet kind of good. And it’s so interesting that we’re like, “Niko! Stop blocking us!” He’s the character that in real life is the kindest and most decent. But none of us want to be told not to have that extra drink. None of us want to be told not to snog the person that we fancy even though it’s a terrible idea, and that’s the same for them on the show. Can you tell me about Jodie Comer’s accent work on the show? I was thinking just this morning about how amazing Jodie is. Generally speaking, I would write “Scottish accent,” for example, and then Jodie would just come in and do it perfectly. She’s an extraordinary mimic, with an unbelievable ear. She literally just learned French, she does it all by ear. She likes to keep Villanelle very far away from her own accent, which I think is wise, but there hasn’t been an accent she hasn’t been able to do, or a language. You’re playing Camilla Parker-Bowles in the next season of “The Crown.” What’s your preparation been like to play a real, living person? What’s really great about it, though, is that there’s absolutely nothing about young Camilla. There’s two pictures. She was very private, and what we’re dealing with in the new season is her relationship with Charles that predated her marriage, and predated his marriage by decades, I think. So I felt I was coming at her from who I think she is now, and Peter Morgan does so much diligent research that really it’s all on the page. You get to turn off the analytical, angsty part of your brain about playing someone real. An earlier version of this article misstated the awards “Killing Eve” Season 1 received. It was nominated for Emmys, it did not win them. A previous version of this article misstated Sally Woodward Gentle’s role on ""Killing Eve.""

2019,‘King James Goes Down!’: How the Internet Turned on LeBron,"Screenland On the internet, mockery often follows adoration. For a while, we take pride in the leaders we’ve chosen, forgiving their frailties, basking in their accomplishments, taking their victories as evidence of our own wisdom in exalting them. But do we really want our heroes to believe they’re better than us? Resentment builds quietly. When a hero’s weaknesses start to show, we circle like hyenas, smirking and sneering: He was always a bit arrogant, and she was so overpaid, and did you see his bald spot? It happens in politics and entertainment. But it happens fastest in sports, where a player’s late 20s count as middle age and every error is broadcast in high-definition slow motion. And with the N.B.A. playoffs now in swing without the involvement of LeBron James, the end of one forgettable late-in-the-season basketball game looks, in retrospect, like a pivotal moment in his story. It was a Sunday matinee against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden — James’s first game in New York in a Los Angeles Lakers uniform. The Knicks have been dismal for decades, but New York remains the mecca of basketball, the crucible where superstars prove their mettle. It was here that Michael Jordan, fresh off his baseball sabbatical, scored 55 points to declare that he was more than capable of a second act in basketball. It’s still too soon to declare James’s own, more modest reinvention — a move, after years in and out of Cleveland, to cushy Los Angeles — a failure. But we can now, at least, conclusively say that the first year did not go well. For the first time since the George W. Bush administration, James’s team did not even qualify for the playoffs, a stinging embarrassment in a season filled with them. Murals welcoming him to town were vandalized before he played a single game. Halfway through the year, the 34-year-old injured his groin. He tried, and failed, to get most of his teammates traded. (“You’re still here?” was the subtext of the second half of the season.) And to be honest, purple doesn’t really suit him. Do you blame him for trying? James’s move to Los Angeles was an attempt at the great American art of reinvention — a bet on one last adventure, all the better if it included movies, mansions and sunglasses. But the caper unlocked a strange, negative energy, a giddy viciousness that has swept across the sports landscape and, at times, felt almost feral. At the end of an otherwise meaningless contest, the Lakers were losing to the Knicks by one point with 20 seconds left, and the packed arena was raucous, the crowd on its feet. James started with the ball on the opposite end, dribbling regally down the court, fully in command. He may have been wearing a new purple jersey, but he still had No. 23 emblazoned across his chest — Michael Jordan’s number, the N.B.A. equivalent of Superman’s S. “They know they’ve got to stop King James,” Walt Frazier, the daffy Knicks announcer, said on the broadcast. This unlucky assignment fell to Mario Hezonja, a scrappy Knicks journeyman from Croatia who comes off the bench, occasionally, for the worst team in the league. With 10 seconds left, James was behind the three-point line, dribbling away from Hezonja’s halfhearted swipes at the ball, like a lion toying with a kitten. With five seconds left, he was driving past Hezonja the same way he has hundreds of times, thousands of times, in games with far higher stakes. But with three seconds left, almighty James went up awkwardly and found Hezonja still there, perfectly in position, his arm overhead to block what would have been the game-winning shot. The final toppling, the moment when it all hit the ground, arrived in that highlight clip: first the shot, slapped resoundingly down, and then the impassive look on James’s face as the arena around him took in his belly flop and erupted in cheers. There was something hypnotic about it, like witnessing the exact moment of a catastrophe. A tidal wave swallows a city skyline as you watch, stomach falling, and then watch again. The Lakers lost. “King James goes down!” Frazier bellowed. James’s face betrayed nothing as he walked off the court, wiping his face with his jersey. And Mario Hezonja, the perfect foil for the greatest athlete in a generation, exploded across the internet, a viral moment that encapsulated James’s whole Lakers experiment gone wrong. James is used to a different kind of viral. He was the first basketball superstar of the Instagram era, the one who used a phone to broadcast his shirtless workouts while rapping along to au courant rap songs. He is so meme-fluent that he once set Instagram aflame by posting a picture of Arthur the aardvark’s clenched fist. (It’s a long story.) Now, in what may or may not turn out to be the winter of his career, he finds himself on the other side of the memes. After the blocked shot, people seized on an image from far earlier in the game as an emblem of what was to come. (Whether in conspiracy theory or sports, the internet bends facts and chronology into the story it wants to tell.) It shows James kneeling on the court after a routine foul, head in hand, a “Pietá” of defeat. Behind him looms Hezonja, a wisp of a pubescent mustache just visible above his smirk, pointing a finger at the fallen James, laughing. The internet swallowed the image of Super Mario dethroning King James and regurgitated it in esoteric jokes about Harry Potter and Black Panther (“Is this your king?”) — plus, of course, memes about the memes. The N.B.A. has seen this happen before. The asterisk on Jordan’s legacy has taken the unusual shape of his own sobbing, snotty face — the Crying Jordan meme. It’s actually a photo of Jordan being moved by the applause at his Hall of Fame induction ceremony, but online it represents failure, ridiculous pathos, whatever mockery you want. The internet shrugs at Jordan’s championships; it laughs endlessly at him ugly-crying. There was a time when we could hardly have put James any higher. A billboard of him, 10 stories tall, hung in downtown Cleveland: It read, “We are all Witnesses,” as though being in James’s presence was itself a spiritual experience. But when our heroes become one step less heroic, they embarrass us — they make us feel old, they make us spiteful — and we turn them into jesters. The internet, especially, has embraced James’s failure so lustfully that you wonder if the seeds of animosity were there all along. When we look up at our idols, is there a shard of hatred buried inside our adoration? Do we quietly resent the very success we root for? Do we, like children with Lego towers, build up our heroes just to topple them? Ozymandias was once invincible, too. Just think of the memes of his trunkless legs, buried in the sand.",The New York Times
2019,‘Knitting Is Coding’ and Yarn Is Programmable in This Physics Lab,"For Elisabetta Matsumoto, knot theory is knit theory. Elisabetta Matsumoto holds a Geared Cuboctahedral Jitterbug that she designed with mathematician Henry Segerman.CreditCreditJohnathon Kelso for The New York Times BOSTON — On the eve of the American Physical Society’s annual March meeting, a Sunday “stitch ‘n bitch” session convened during happy hour at a lobby bar of the Westin Boston Waterfront hotel. Karen Daniels, a physicist at North Carolina State University, had tweeted notice of the meet-up earlier that day: “Are you a physicist into knitting, crocheting, or other fiber arts?” she asked. “I’ll be the one knitting a torus.” (A torus is a mathematized doughnut; hers was inspired by a figure in a friend’s scientific paper.) At the bar, amid tables cluttered with balls of yarn, Dr. Daniels absorbed design advice from a group of specialized knitters, among them Elisabetta Matsumoto, an applied mathematician and physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a co-host of the gathering. For Dr. Matsumoto, knitting is more than a handicraft hobby with health benefits. She is embarking on a five-year project, “What a Tangled Web We Weave,” funded by the National Science Foundation, to investigate the mathematics and mechanics of “the ancient technology known as knitting.” Some of the oldest examples date to the 11th century in Egypt. But despite generations of practical and experiential knowledge, the physical and mathematical properties of knitted fabric rarely are studied in a way that produces predictive models about how such fabrics behave. Dr. Matsumoto argues that “knitting is coding” and that yarn is a programmable material. The potential dividends of her research range from wearable electronics to tissue scaffolding. During the happy-hour meetup, she knitted a swatch illustrating a plastic surgery technique called Z-plasty. The swatch was for a talk she would deliver at 8 a.m. on Wednesday morning called “Twisted Topological Tangles.” Scores of physicists turned up, despite a competing parallel session on “The Extreme Mechanics of Balloons.” “I’ve been knitting since I was a kid,” Dr. Matsumoto told her (mostly male) audience. “That was the thing I did to get along with my mom when I was a teenager. It’s just been a dream to take all of this stuff that I learned and played with as a child and turn it into something scientifically rigorous.” As a first step, her team is enumerating all possible knittable stitches: “There’s going to be a countably infinite number. How to classify them is what we are working on now.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The investigation is informed by the mathematical tradition of knot theory. A knot is a tangled circle — a circle embedded with crossings that cannot be untangled. (A circle with no crossings is an “unknot.”) “The knitted stitch is a whole series of slipknots, one after the other,” said Dr. Matsumoto. Rows and columns of slipknots form a lattice pattern so regular that it is analogous to crystal structure and crystalline materials. By way of knot theory, Dr. Matsumoto essentially is developing a knit theory: an alphabet of unit-cell stitches, a glossary of stitch combinations, and a grammar governing the knitted geometry and topology — the fabric’s stretchiness, or its “emergent elasticity.” When discussing the emergent properties of knitting, Dr. Matsumoto sometimes makes reference to a butterfly, the vibrant blue morpho. Its color is optically emergent, the result not of chemical pigment but of structure. In effect, each wing is a metamaterial: covered in layers of nanosized scales, arranged in a pattern called a gyroid surface, the wing absorbs most wavelengths of light, but reflects blue. Knitted fabric is also a metamaterial. A length of yarn is all but inelastic, but when configured in slipknots — in patterns of knits and purls — varying degrees of elasticity emerge. “Just based on these two stitches, these two fundamental units, we can make a whole series of fabrics, and each of these fabrics has remarkably different elastic properties,” Dr. Matsumoto told the audience. She first combined her math-y and woolly mind-sets as a Ph.D. student, after admiring a friend’s crocheted interpretation of the hyperbolic plane (curly kale is a vegetable example) and wondering how to do it differently. “It irritated me that it wasn’t isotropic,” she recalled on the day before her talk. She could see where the crochet had begun, whereas a true hyperbolic plane should betray no starting point and no direction. She thought, “I can fix that.” She crocheted a network of lace-like heptagons that produced a more uniform rendering. The hyperbolic plane has been her constant companion ever since. In April, she had a hyperbolic helicoid — a fantastically swirly helix, somewhat like a seashell — tattooed to her left shoulder. During her talk, Dr. Matsumoto passed around her hand-knit swatches: stockinette (standard jersey, fairly stretchy, used for T-shirts); garter (stretchier); ribbing (stretchiest); and seed (not so stretchy, but one of her favorites). A sizable fraction of her audience also flaunted their hand-knits — sweaters, hats, a water-bottle cozy, indeterminate works in progress. Dr. Matsumoto’s most prized hand-knit creation is her “dragon of happiness” shawl (from a design by knitter Sharon Winsauer, a.k.a. the Crazy Lace Lady). Knitting away for two months, Dr. Matsumoto encountered one stitch in the dragon’s beard that she had never seen before. “In the pattern for the dragon, there are all these crazy stitches,” she said — stitches that took up not just a single cell on the pattern grid, but stretched across numerous cells, seeming to follow a horizontal array rather than the usual, vertical orientation. Her team’s knit theory will incorporate these and other stitch morphologies, as well as intentional stitch defects and constraints, such as how a yarn bends, twists and compresses; how many plies it has, how thick it is, and how “floofy.” Floofiness refers to a yarn’s “halo area, where ephemeral fuzzy fibers stick out,” Dr. Matsumoto said, and it changes the way two pieces of yarn interact with each other, their friction and energy exchange. “I’d love to write a paper using the word ‘floofy’ as a technical term.” Dr. Matsumoto’s presentation opened a three-hour session entitled “Fabrics, Knits and Knots” — the first time that the subject had been addressed at the American Physical Society’s annual meeting. “Sabetta is spectacularly creative, and she is doing really mathematically sophisticated work,” said Pedro Reis, the session organizer, who leads the Flexible Structures Laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. “She is also attracting a lot of people to the field who might not otherwise even think about science.” During his introductory remarks, Dr. Reis had a vexing encounter with an intertwined microphone cord. “This is a good example of why we really care about this topic,” he said. Dr. Reis grapples with the likes of long-overhand shoelace knotting, climbing knots, basket weaving, surgical sutures, and how to pass on the art of surgical-knot craftsmanship to robots. During the session, his lab mates described how they had used a CT scan to probe the internal structure of knot filaments and the friction that arises where filaments touch. After the meeting, Dr. Matsumoto sent him home with some of her swatches. Derek Moulton, of the University of Oxford, mentioned variants of sailor’s knots, DNA and protein knots, and worms that tie themselves into knots in order to minimize dehydration. He went on discuss “whether a knotted filament with zero points of self-contact may be realized physically.” That is, can a knot exist wherein none of its crossings touch? (It can; try it at home with a strip of paper, or a cord.) And Thomas Plumb-Reyes, an applied physicist at Harvard, presented his research on “Detangling Hair” to a standing-room-only audience. “What is going on in tangled hair?” he asked. “What is the optimal combing strategy?” Shashank Markande, a Ph.D. student working with Dr. Matsumoto, reported on their stitch classification work so far. Together, they had derived a conjecture: All knittable stitches must be ribbon knots. (A ribbon knot is a very technical tangle.) And they pondered the corollary: Are all ribbon knots knittable? Back in February, Mr. Markande (who started knitting only recently for the sake of science) thought he’d found an example of an unknittable ribbon knot, using a knots-and-links software program called SnapPy. He sent Dr. Matsumoto a text message with a sketch: “Tell me if this can be knitted?” Dr. Matsumoto was just heading out for a run, and by the time she returned, having manipulated the yarn every which way in her head, she had worked out an answer. “I think that can be knitted,” she texted back. When Mr. Markande pressed her on how, she added: “It’s knittable by our rules, but it isn’t trivial to do with needles.” Mr. Markande said later, “I was pretty surprised. With my limited knowledge, I thought it could not be knitted. But Sabetta managed to knit it.” For the Tangled Web project, most of the experimental knitting is produced by a replica of a vintage 1970s knitting machine, the Taitexma Industrial and Home-Based Knitting Machine Model TH-860, which is operated by Krishma Singal, a doctoral student. The machine can also be programmed by punched cards — as was the Jacquard loom, invented in 1804 by Joseph Marie Jacquard and sometimes called the first digital technology. Dr. Matsumoto’s team likes to contemplate how stitch patterns provide code — more complex code than the 1s and 0s of binary — that creates the program for the elasticity and geometry of knitted fabric. The buzzword is “topological programmable materials,” said postdoc Michael Dimitriyev. He is working on a computer simulation of knitted fabric, inputting yarn properties and stitch topology, and outputting the geometry and elasticity of the real-life finished object. “I’m the killjoy that brings in elasticity,” he likes to say. The team’s first paper, currently underway, will verify Dr. Dimitriyev’s simulations against Ms. Singal’s hard-copy swatches. Once the computer simulation is refined, Dr. Matsumoto and her collaborators can pull out equations and algorithms for knitted fabric behavior, which in turn could be put into physics engines for computer game graphics, or movies. Pixar’s “Brave” and “Monsters, Inc.” showcased cutting-edge animation of hair and fur, but yarn has yet to have its time in the spotlight. Fabric animation is still very trial-and-error, and it requires time-intensive supercomputers to render. “This could go in that direction,” said Dr. Matsumoto. It’s a good yarn, albeit just at the beginning, and still a bit floofy around the edges. An earlier version of this article misstated the age of some of oldest examples of knitting. They date to the 11th century, not to the 11th century B.C.E.",The New York Times
2019,‘Licht’ Unleashes a Helicopter String Quartet,"An extremely rare performance of Karlheinz Stockhausen’s sprawling spectacle — or at least 15 hours of it — is coming to Amsterdam. AMSTERDAM — There was a palpable buzz on a recent afternoon in the Gashouder, a big, round former industrial building in a park on the west side of Amsterdam. A buzz, that is, beyond the four helicopters whose steady drone was being relayed through banks of speakers set up to rehearse a crucial part of “Aus Licht,” a marathon performance of selections from Karlheinz Stockhausen’s eye-poppingly extravagant, never-fully-performed, seven-opera, 29-hour “Licht” cycle. (Divided into three hefty evenings, it runs from May 31 through June 10.) Four women walked onto a stage inside the building. A moderator explained that they were the Pelargos Quartet, and they were about to perform from inside the helicopters everyone was hearing. The women walked out a side door. Above the stage, four screens flickered to life. The audience saw worried-looking men wiping raindrops from a passing shower off the helicopters, which were idling a few hundred yards away. The quartet members took their seats inside the copters, lifted their instruments, and began to play. One by one, each transmitting to her individual screen, they lifted off, playing and chanting, while the industrial ports on the outskirts of Amsterdam flew by beneath them. If you’ve heard of Stockhausen, it may well be because of this bit of “Licht”: a Dada ballet for fume-belching helicopters and string tremolos that plays on the tension between the careful planning (not to mention financial and carbonous resources) needed to perform it and the pure, gonzo joy inherent in its conception. Fantastical enough to envision on its own, it is just a tiny part of “Licht” (“Light”), into which Stockhausen poured almost all his musical output between 1977 and 2003. (He died, at 79, in 2007.) “Aus Licht,” a production of the Holland Festival in collaboration with the Dutch National Opera, the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and the Stockhausen Foundation for Music, will present 15 hours of the work across three newly assembled programs. In an interview, Pierre Audi, the director, called it a “helicopter journey” through the piece. The seven operas of “Licht” — each of which represents a day of the week — present a series of interactions between three main characters and their interlocutors: Michael, the archangel, who represents love; Lucifer, the fallen angel, who represents light; and Eve, who represents life. Elements of Michael’s story echo Stockhausen’s troubled childhood: Michael learns from his father and mother to love music, then watches his father die in combat and his mother be committed to a mental hospital. (Stockhausen’s father died in World War II, and his mother died during the Nazi period in the mental hospital where she had been committed.) Later in the cycle, elements of traditional plot fall further away, and the piece develops a more symbolic, ritualistic aspect. Each of the three characters is associated with a melody or “formula,” much like a Wagnerian leitmotif. In Stockhausen’s unique high-late-modernist compositional style, these formulas are then expanded, inverted and built upon in an extension of serial technique, so that every pitch, timbre and volume arises organically out of them. Though this may seem like a dully rigid way of generating 29 hours of music, Stockhausen’s work in practice has wild, sensuous, almost Surrealist flair. After his bold early experiments in electronic music and the unusual physical arrangements of ensembles, his style grew more idiosyncratically spiritual, dealing with grand, obscure messages from the cosmos and performed largely by musicians (and family members) close to him, and for whom he became something of a guru. In both “Licht” and “Klang” (“Sound,” a cycle representing the hours of the day, which he worked on from 2003 until his death), he assigned colors to different sections, associating them with moods and tones. From his earliest works, he was fascinated with the voices of children. The “Licht” score includes sections scored for children’s and adult choruses, synthesizers, hundreds of brass players, orchestras, solo singers and, of course, the helicopters. These sections were mostly given individual premieres by Stockhausen’s own ensembles, and only later received staged productions. Each of the seven operas has been presented at least once, but never have all seven — or even a selection this large — been performed together. Staging elements from “Licht” is not easy. Stockhausen composed the work to, and sometimes beyond, the limits of possibility for directors, designers and musicians. In addition to the notes, each score contains extensive stage directions that are difficult to execute — to say the least. Some sections call for two separate halls, with the ability to open and close the visual and sound barrier between them. Some call for silver aircraft to crash on the stage, and for chrome-color walls to be sliced by lasers to reveal a surface of rock crystal. The 2012 premiere of “Sonntag” (“Sunday”) at the Cologne Opera contributed to a budget deficit so large that the theater’s director was forced to resign. Mr. Audi’s “Aus Licht” staging uses light, smoke and video to approximate some of these more spectacular effects, but still required extensive building in the raw warehouse space where it will be presented; the audience will move to face performers moving among multiple stages, sometimes gathering in the center and in the aisles. Producing even these selections will require hundreds of musicians, including 194 Royal Conservatory students, 14 of whom have been studying the piece in a special “Aus Licht” master’s program. Including technicians, 680 people are needed to bring the project off, and each day’s rehearsal schedule has stretched 12 hours or more. Mr. Audi, 61, predicted that this is more of the music than will be performed again in his lifetime; the financial requirements, in an era of austerity, are simply too high. Stockhausen’s work has a reputation for spiky intellectual difficulty, but Mr. Audi shrugged this off. “It’s not an intellectual drama,” he said in a break between rehearsals. “It’s believing in myth, in ritual, in spirituality. It’s the naïveté of a children’s world, from which everything springs and to which everything goes.” “It’s brilliant,” he added, discussing the gravely beautiful “Angel Processions” from the final opera, “because you think you’re seeing shamanistic priests. And then suddenly, there’s a whirling, crazy woman on the other end of the room doing something else. And that’s part of the wackiness of the thing. He saw life. He put himself on his own planet.” The next day, the helicopters were back in their hangar, and a different set of musicians, mostly brass players, were rehearsing “Invasion-Explosion with Departure,” depicting Michael’s trumpets and Lucifer’s trombones in combat. The Gashouder, decked out by the designer Urs Schönbaum with scaffolded stages and arcs of LED lights that can change color at the flick of a switch, glowed fiery red. Cameramen followed the groups of musicians as they ran, lunged and struck poses throughout the space, playing complex chords from memory and wearing metal headpieces loosely resembling radio towers. (The costumes were designed by Wojciech Dziedzic.) This section, the one originally intended to feature the crashing aircraft and laser-decimated chrome wall, still felt gripping and apocalyptic amid light, projection and smoke. “If we want to bring this up to date,” said Elisabeth Lusche, a trumpet student in the “Aus Licht” master’s program, “what is the limit that we’re pushing now? How can we keep this true to what Stockhausen wanted, while still finding way to be extreme in the present?” She said the master’s program, taught by Kathinka Pasveer, Stockhausen’s widow and the project’s musical director, along with other key Stockhausen collaborators and interpreters, had given students the opportunity to delve deeply enough into the forbidding technical demands of the music to develop interpretive agency. “When we have the rehearsals,” Ms. Lusche said, “Kathinka’s motto is always just to ‘play it perfect and beautiful.’ And at the beginning we were like, ‘Yeah, O.K., look at the score. I would love to do that!’ But now that we’re here, it’s something that’s finally clicked. And so what started as a joke, now it’s happening.” When asked about that “perfect and beautiful” comment, Ms. Pasveer smiled. “It’s true,” she said. “There is a feeling new music must be straightforward. But Stockhausen was very emotional also, and it must always sound beautiful. Never ugly.” She said teaching a new generation of performers to meet Stockhausen’s demands, which emphasize the physical, performative aspect of instrumental playing more than many other composers, brought her joy. “These pieces are our children, my children,” she said. “And if they only depend on me, they die with me. So it’s important to see that after a long period of study, others can play this music so beautifully. The piece is alive. The child is alive.” Later that night at the Gashouder, the Cappella Amsterdam and a second choir of master’s students rehearsed “Angel Processions.” The main choir, divided into small groups singing in different languages, moved slowly around and toward the center of the room, down aisles glowing blue with light and smoke. The screens were back on, showing paintings of angels and close-ups of calligraphy that faded into live video of the singers. The student chorus, arranged in a circle around the periphery, sang a steady drone, getting louder and softer, cutting across the harmonies, creating strange new chords. By the end, the small groups had united in the center of the room, lit by golden light. Ms. Pasveer, dressed entirely in white, sat, looking down at her score and then up at the performers, smiling. Everyone sang in unison, their voices echoing off the high ceiling. When they stopped, the sound hovered in the air for a moment — like a helicopter, or an angel.

2019,‘Long Shot’ Review: Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen Give Good Heart,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Long Shot” isn’t going to save the romantic comedy, but it’s an adrenaline shot of pure pleasure to the genre’s failing heart. The outline is familiar: Two people meet, retreat and then circle each other, all while talking and talking. The romantic comedy turns on people who fit together — in bed, on the dance floor — but also talk to each other, exchanging words that stop flowing and faltering only with a culminating kiss and teasing fade-out. The difference here is that unlike a lot of romances, the woman retains her power and identity, and that’s how the movie likes it. In “Long Shot,” Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron), the secretary of state of the United States, and Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen), a struggling journalist, talk a lot. They connect while attending a charity event — Boyz II Men is crooning onstage — spotting each other across a crowded room. It’s a classic meet cute, in the parlance of the romantic comedy, but with a twist. Charlotte used to babysit Fred (she’s a few years older), a fact that still looms large in his memory. They haven’t seen each other since, but when they meet again they quickly spark, lighting a long fuse that winds through the story as nostalgia turns into something sweeter and then heavier. It’s preposterous: She’s a giant, a goddess and he’s … Seth Rogen. It doesn’t bode well that the movie initially seems more interested in Fred than in Charlotte, an apparent imbalance that suggests this will be another weak chuckle-fest in which the female lead is a convenience or decoration, on hand mainly to vouch for her guy’s heterosexuality. The opener, though — with Fred undercover in a roomful of neo-Nazis — proves tactical. It sets a strangely uneasy mood for a comedy, one that’s funny ha-ha but also unsettling. More to the story’s point, it also places Fred in the most toxic of man caves imaginable: a homosocial world of booze-chugging, chest-thumping, sieg-heiling bros. Of course Fred escapes — taunting the enemy, he briefly turns into a self-proclaimed Jewish superhero — and his adventure is folded into a subplot. It’s a shrewd introduction, one that establishes Fred’s ethical principles and willingness to take risks; it also gives him an early, crucial triumph. Just as important, it offers a semi-comic glimpse at a culture that fetishizes manliness and devalues women. When Fred flees, he breaks away from baddies but also from the ultimate in masculinity cults. It’s in keeping with a character who may have a best dude on speed dial (the amusing O’Shea Jackson Jr.) yet doesn’t suffer from the usual movie male maladies, including fear of women. Charlotte soon enters, effortlessly dominating every scene and room while juggling and suffering assorted fools, including the president of the United States (Bob Odenkirk in peerless form). Theron, a natural screen presence who has developed into an undeniable one, is wonderful in “Long Shot.” She’s a fascinating performer with a watchfulness that can make her seem detached. She seems supremely and confidently alone onscreen, which in moments can create an internal tension with her physical superfluidity, her outward, inviting flow. It’s an ideal combination for this character who never breaks stride as she agilely evades obstacles, most of which are men (Andy Serkis, Alexander Skarsgard). “Long Shot” humorously skitters over these and other hurdles, including the imperative that powerful single women must have men by their side, mostly to make everyone feel comfortable with all that female power. That’s a tricky idea for any romantic comedy to take on, one that “Long Shot” doesn’t solve but instead slides over after Charlotte hires Fred as a speechwriter. Much of what happens isn’t surprising, but Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah’s script is consistently, genially funny, filled with patter and nonsense, and spiked with sincerity and a few gross-out flourishes. And while the director, Jonathan Levine, doesn’t do much visually, he pulls off the occasional, well-timed sight gags and often puts Charlotte and Fred in the same shot — they even share the frame — rather than loading up on the usual TV-friendly close-ups of single heads. Movies have long segregated men and women by genre, but at some point we seemed to enter a new age of his-or-her cinema. Straight men and women went their separate, generally unequal ways and stopped talking, really talking, to each other in movies. Men retreated into buddy pictures à la Butch and Sundance or swooned into bromances; for their part, women prepped for weddings that felt like battles or indulged in a hangover-inducing hurrah. The romantic comedies in which men and women hook up have often been excruciating (“The Ugly Truth,” “The Proposal”), fueled by sexist stereotypes and gender policing that suggested women’s lib had given Hollywood a permanent headache. Yet we just can’t quit romantic comedy, even if contemporary American movies as a whole are more comfortable making war than peace, much less love. The reasons are cultural, social and industrial, at once obvious and obscure. One problem is the current business model in which big studios pour tremendous resources into globally salable male-driven blockbusters. The other problem is the industry’s deep-seated, long-maintained fear of female power. In a business long defined by aesthetic and economic conservatism, and that has a bad habit of selling the same stories, women — including those who are sexually desirable, desiring and sovereign — remain a puzzle and a threat. It’s no wonder that after decades of putting women in rigidly circumscribed roles the industry has had a tough time figuring out what to do with them. If things have started to shift it’s partly because heroines like Katniss Everdeen and creators like Amy Schumer are helping redefine the female lead. Like Mindy Kaling and other funny women, Schumer is doing it with laughs and stumbles, but also with an earnestness that affirms something real is at stake: love, hearts and maybe, possibly, a gender-fluid happily ever after. “Long Shot” mostly just toys with some of these ideas; it’s awfully straight, in all senses. But it doesn’t just put a woman on top, it also leaves her there, blissfully.

2019,Opinion | ‘Make No Apologies for Yourself’,"disability Are we writing for other disabled people, for the nondisabled, or for everyone? The work of these poets speaks for itself. Ms. Queen and Dr. Weise are poets. The seven poems you will find here below, as well as seven others that will follow in a second post, were curated by us over the past several months, and represent only a small segment of poets with disabilities writing vital, engaged and powerful work today. To arrive here, we asked many disabled poets to offer their work, and this process raised issues that permeate debates in the disability community. We learned that some poets prefer not to claim disability as an identity, publicly or at all, and because this is a “disability” series, those poets did not wish to offer their work. We were also faced with questions raised in the recent and provocative debate between “disability poetics” and “crip poetics”: Who is the audience? Are we writing for other disabled people? For the nondisabled, or for everyone? How do we write for both while emphasizing the disabled poet’s aesthetic? Our goals here are many. In curating this group of poems, we want to show aesthetic range, thematic variety, and formal power. We don’t want to repeat the ableist claims that appear so often in the media, even sometimes in this paper, that disability is a condition to be cured; Deafness is a condition to be cochlear-ed. These claims are ignorant of disability pride, Deaf pride, and our culture. In offering this work, we reject the stereotypes and misconceptions disabled people deal with every day from nondisabled people, and even from other disabled people. We refuse to box the poems in by requiring a fidelity to subject. It is enough that the poets say: I am disabled and/or Deaf. The poems can do anything. We are grateful to Jennifer Bartlett and Peter Catapano, who edited the first poetry collection for this series in August 2018. We believe these poems express complexity, nuance, joy, tenderness, love, incisiveness and brilliance. We hope you will take them in, read them with the care with which they were written and selected, and understand that we disabled people do not just deserve or ask for the right to exist in this world with the same dignity and respect nondisabled people receive. We demand it.

2019,"‘Ma’ Review: Octavia Spencer Serves Up Liquor, Terror and a Killer Performance","A psycho-revenge thriller from the director of “The Help”? Why not! Just don’t expect a coherent story line. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Ma,” a clammy, sloppy, sometimes funny thriller about an enabler of underage drinking, could and maybe should have been advertised as “from the director of ‘The Help’ and the producer of ‘Get Out.’” The cognitive dissonance of seeing those two titles in one phrase is pretty good preparation for the crossed signals and jammed circuits that make this movie interesting. Which isn’t the same as good, exactly. The director (Tate Taylor) and the screenwriter (Scotty Landes) take a premise with all kinds of potential — a middle-aged woman first befriends and then terrorizes a bunch of teenagers — and find various ways to mess it up, while also delivering a few jolts and laughs along the way. And also leaving room for a handful of odd and engaging performances. The four best parts of the movie are Juliette Lewis, Diana Silvers, Allison Janney and, supremely, Octavia Spencer, who plays the title character, a veterinarian’s assistant also known as Sue Ann. (Janney, drawing on leftover grouchiness from “I, Tonya,” plays the veterinarian.) Lewis and Silvers are Erica and Maggie, a mother and daughter who have recently moved back to Erica’s hometown. She takes a job at the local casino, and her daughter enrolls at the local high school, which was her mother’s alma mater as well as Sue Ann’s. There she befriends a group of mildly rebellious students, developing a crush on one named Andy (Corey Fogelmanis). It turns out that Andy’s father (Luke Evans) also went to high school with Erica and Sue Ann, a fact that takes on greater significance as the present-day intrigue develops. After reluctantly agreeing to buy liquor for the kids, Sue Ann, insisting on the nickname Ma, invites them to her rambling house in the middle of the woods. She has a basement that serves as a perfect party room. Before long it’s a thriving kiddie speakeasy, with minimal rules — don’t go upstairs is the main one — and decidedly lax adult supervision. There’s a catch, of course. There are a few too many catches, to be honest. Maggie and her pals — Haley (McKaley Miller), Darrell (Dante Brown) and Chaz (Gianni Paolo), in addition to Andy — start to get a little creeped out about their new friend. For her part, Sue Ann turns out to be motivated not so much by pathetic loneliness as by a long-simmering, pathological desire for revenge. To say what exactly she wants revenge for would be an unconscionable spoiler, but “Ma” comes close to spoiling its own surprise with flashbacks that hint heavily at a traumatic youthful humiliation. Some of the parents of Maggie’s clique were involved in it, though some were not. It’s hard to tell if Sue Ann’s stalkerish, sadistic behavior is opportunistic, or if she has been carefully planning to punish the children for the sins of their mothers and fathers. It kind of doesn’t matter, and it also kind of does. Spencer’s performance embraces all possibilities. She’s warm, needy, scary, conspiratorial and witty, overriding any concerns for coherence with the sheer force of her personality. But the movie, like Ma’s young friends, lets her down. The teenagers are fickle, cruel and entitled, dropping her as quickly as they had embraced her when she starts acting weird. They are also just kids, wrapped in an aura of innocence whatever their age-appropriate transgressions. As a genre exercise, “Ma” offers some juicy, nasty kicks, but it also gestures — with maddening coyness — in the direction of the kind of socially aware allegory that made “Get Out” (and “Us”) so fascinating. Sue Ann is black, and all but one of Maggie’s friends are white, but race is mentioned only once, even though it casts a heavy shadow on the back story. There seem to be no other African-American adults in this town, and Ma, though she lives with her daughter (Tanyell Waivers), has no other family or friends. Whether Taylor and Landes are aiming for subtlety or deniability — whether “Ma” is a critique of racial thinking or an experiment in color-blindness — is a question to ponder, if you’re so inclined. Either way, the movie ties itself up in knots as it tries to be provocative without giving offense, and offering more complacency and comfort than terror. In essence, “Ma” serves up a hand-wringing, guilty case against reparations, painting an attempt to find redress for past crimes as monstrous and leaning heavily on an archetypal assumption of black scariness. “What happened to you was wrong, and we should have stopped it,” someone says to Sue Ann late in the film. Coming when it does in the action, the line is more like a punch line than an apology. The joke is still on the title character, who made the mistake of supposing that her feelings, or her life, might matter. Ma Rated R. You kiss your mother with that mouth?

2019,"Opinion | ‘Medicare for All’ Could Kill Two Million Jobs, and That’s O.K.","Reform has a cost. But the point of a health care system is to treat patients, not to buttress the economy. Dr. Rosenthal was an emergency room doctor before becoming a journalist. As calls for radical health reform grow louder, many on the right, in the center and in the health care industry are arguing that proposals like “Medicare for all” would cause economic ruin, decimating a sector that represents nearly 20 percent of our economy. While exploring a presidential run, the former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz called Medicare for all “not American,” adding, “What industry are we going to abolish next — the coffee industry?” He said that it would “wipe out the insurance industry.” A fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute wrote that it would “carpet bomb the industry.” David Wichmann, the chief executive of UnitedHealth Group, warned that it “would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs.” It’s true: Any significant reform would require major realignment of the health care sector, which is now the biggest employer in at least a dozen states. Most hospitals and specialists would probably lose money. Some, like the middlemen who negotiate drug prices, could be eliminated. That would mean job losses in the millions. Though it will be economically painful, the point is to streamline for patients a Kafka-esque health care system that makes money for industry through irrational practices. After all, shouldn’t the primary goal of a health care system be delivering efficient care at a reasonable price, not rewarding shareholders or buttressing the economy? In 2012, the Harvard economists Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra warned against “treating the health care system like a (wildly inefficient) jobs program.” They were rightly worried that the health care system was the primary engine of recovery from the Great Recession. And yet the revelation that the health care sector added more jobs last year than any other in the economy was greeted by many as good news. It’s not surprising that those involved in the business of medicine have joined forces in a lobbying and media campaign, the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, to ward off transformational reform, particularly Medicare for all. But fed-up voters seem ready to upend an industry that saps their finances, wastes their time and doesn’t deliver particularly good care. Few people would mourn the end of $35 million annual compensation packages for insurance executives or the downsizing of companies that have raised insulin prices to 10 times what they are in Canada — though they might miss hospitals’ valet parking and private rooms. Well over half of Americans already say they have a favorable view of Medicare for all. Though approval falls off when confronted with details such as higher taxes, it is clear that the electorate is searching for something big. Change could come in many guises: for example, some form of Medicare expansion, government negotiations on drug prices or enhancing the power of the Affordable Care Act. The more fundamental the reform, the more severe the economic effect. The first casualties of a Medicare for all plan, said Dr. Kevin Schulman, a physician-economist at Stanford, would be the “intermediaries that add to cost, not quality.” For example, the armies of administrators, coders, billers and claims negotiators who make good middle-class salaries and have often spent years in school learning these skills. There would be far less need for drug and device sales representatives who ply their trade office to office and hospital to hospital in a single-payer system, or one in which prices are set at a national level. Some geographic areas would be hit particularly hard. A single hospital system is by far the biggest employer in many post-manufacturing cities like Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Hospitals and hospital corporations make up the top six employers in Boston and two of the top three in Nashville. Hartford is known as the insurance capital of the world. Where would New Jersey be if drug makers took a big hit, or Minnesota if device makers vastly shrank their work force? (That may be why some Democratic representatives and senators from these left-leaning states have been quiet or inconsistent on Medicare expansion.) Stanford researchers estimate that 5,000 community hospitals would lose more than $151 billion under a Medicare for all plan; that would translate into the loss of 860,000 to 1.5 million jobs. A Navigant study found that a typical midsize, nonprofit hospital system would have a net revenue loss of 22 percent. Robert Pollin, an economist at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, is frustrated not just by the doomsday predictions but also by how proponents of Medicare for all tend to gloss over the jobs issue. “Every proponent of Medicare for all — including myself — has to recognize that the biggest source of cost saving is layoffs,” he said. He has calculated that Medicare for all would result in job losses (mostly among administrators) “somewhere in the range of two million” — about half on the insurers’ side and half employed in hospitals and doctors’ offices to argue with the former. Supporters of Medicare for all, he said, have to think about a “just transition” and “what it might look like.” Of course, if more people get health insurance under an expanded Medicare, there will be a greater need for some workers — like nurse practitioners and physician assistants. And there is a large unmet labor need in caring for an aging population. The latter are mostly low-wage jobs, however, and neither compensates for the losses. Dr. Pollin suggests that a transition to Medicare for all should be accompanied by a plan to give those made redundant up to three years of salary and help retraining for another profession. Despite the short-term suffering caused by any fundamental shift in our health care delivery system, reform would ultimately redirect resources in ways that are good for the economy, many experts say. “I’m sympathetic to the impact that changes will have on specific markets and employment — we can measure that,” Dr. Schulman said. “What we can’t quantify is the effect that high health care costs have had on non-health care industries.” The expense of paying for employees’ health care has depressed wages and entrepreneurship, he said. He described a textile manufacturer that moved more than 1,000 jobs out of the country because it couldn’t afford to pay for insurance for its workers. Such decisions have become common in recent years. “Yes, these are painful transitions,” said Dr. Baicker, who is now the dean of the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. “But the answer is not to freeze the sectors where we are for all time. When agriculture improved and became more productive, no one said everyone had to stay farmers.” Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former New York Times correspondent, is the editor in chief of Kaiser Health News and the author of “An American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘Medicare for All’ Gets Much-Awaited Report. Both Sides Can Claim Victory.,"The Congressional Budget Office usually offers detailed estimates, but not in this case. The Congressional Budget Office published a much-awaited paper about the possible design of a single-payer or “Medicare for all” system in the United States. The budget office most often provides detailed estimates about the cost of legislation. But anyone looking for many numbers in Wednesday’s long report would be disappointed. Instead, the nonpartisan office noted the many ways that legislators could devise such a system, outlining the cost and policy effects of a wide range of difficult choices. It also noted that such a system would be so different from the country’s current situation that any hard estimates would be difficult, even with all the specifics laid out. As such, the report has convenient snippets likely to be deployed by both single-payer devotees and detractors. Within minutes of its release, congressional news releases began pouring out, noting how the report had confirmed this or that position. A change to single-payer, which a substantial number of Democratic presidential candidates and members of Congress have called for, would amount to the largest domestic policy change in decades. It would have broad implications not only for health care and the federal budget, but also for the broader economy. “The magnitude of such responses is difficult to predict because the existing evidence is based on previous changes that were much smaller in scale,” the paper said. [We asked some economists and think tanks to estimate the possible cost of Medicare for all.] Democrats in Congress have been writing bills that would bring the country closer to a single-payer system. And on Tuesday a House committee held the first hearing in more than a decade on the merits of a single-payer approach. Bills sponsored by Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, and Pramila Jayapal, a House Democrat from Washington, would create a so-called Medicare for all. In that system, Americans would be covered by the same government insurer for a wide range of medical benefits, without the need to make any payments to doctors or hospitals when they receive health care. Democrats have also introduced other bills recently, including two this week, proposing more modest changes in how health care is delivered. One, called the Choose Medicare Act, would allow more Americans to opt into the existing Medicare system. Another, called Medicare for America, would automatically enroll more Americans in the government system, and give others a choice between government and private insurance. The single-payer proposals have broad — though not majority — support among Democratic lawmakers so far, meaning they are unlikely to become law in the immediate future. That’s in part why John Yarmuth, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, who supports single-payer health care, asked for a report of this type. Medicare for all is likely to have a high price, and many Democrats would prefer to postpone contending with the politics of such a number until there is a plausible path forward. But as the C.B.O. report highlighted, the expansive approach Mr. Sanders and Ms. Jayapal have embraced is not the only way to devise a single-payer system. Congress could opt to provide all Americans with coverage more similar to what people 65 and older currently receive under Medicare, with more limited benefits and a requirement that they pay some deductibles and co-payments. A single-payer system could preserve some role for private insurance, either to cover certain benefits or to pay for private care outside the standard system. Such decisions could have a big effect on the overall cost. When it came to particulars of those costs, however, the budget office said little. “Government spending on health care would increase substantially,” the paper noted at one point. But it never said by how much. The amount matters because it will influence how much tax revenue will be needed to pay for the program. Supporters of a single-payer plan note that, even though government spending would increase, there could be substantial reductions in the other ways individuals and employers pay for health care now through premiums, out-of-pocket spending and state taxes. The budget office may still provide firm estimates for a proposal if one gets closer to a floor vote in the House or the Senate. The office is charged with developing estimates for legislation, and it produces them even when doing so involves a fair bit of speculation. In past years, for example, the budget office was asked to provide cost estimates for a federal terrorism reinsurance program, which required it to gauge the likelihood of terrorist attacks and the possible expense of their damages. The cost of a single-payer system is not as unpredictable as that of terrorism insurance, but the report’s many caveats and questions highlight how the effects of Medicare for all will depend on a multitude of legislative decisions — and then a larger set of management decisions by the government that runs the system. Would government insurance cause shortages of doctors or waits for care? It depends on how well the system pays clinicians, how individuals respond to more generous health coverage, and how the Medicare system adapts over time. “If the number of providers was not sufficient to meet demand, patients might face increase wait times,” the report noted. But it said such problems were not inevitable under a government-run system: “In the longer run, the government could implement policies to increase the supply of providers.” Would the government eliminate the denials and other red tape that annoy Americans about the private health insurance system? Maybe, or maybe not. The paper notes that requiring patients to see a primary care doctor before a specialist; denying a treatment that is unusual; or requiring patients to try less expensive drugs before more expensive alternatives would all be possible under single-payer, and are limitations with such systems in other countries. Would patients see new and expensive treatments and drugs? That would depend on the government’s approach to approving new therapies. The existing bills provide little detail on how the government would make such decisions. The many questions and nuances are all reminders that single-payer is more complicated than the campaign talking points on either side might suggest. It might not cause rationing. It might not create seamless care. For now, legislators can take their pick of a set of third-party estimates of the cost of the Sanders plan. They range widely, underlining the budget office’s point that precision will be a challenge.",The New York Times

2019,‘Meeting Gorbachev’ Review: Sitting Down With the Last Soviet Leader,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Geopolitics has never been high on Werner Herzog’s list of concerns, at least in his documentaries. Even when he glances toward current events (“Lessons of Darkness,” “Into the Abyss”), the thrust tends to be philosophical — his interests run more to quixotic quests and humanity’s insignificance in the vastness of nature. That makes him an odd fit to interview Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose leadership of the Soviet Union helped bring the Cold War to an end. Then again, if the moral of “Meeting Gorbachev,” directed by Herzog and André Singer, is that contemporary politicians have ignored the lessons of Gorbachev’s leadership, then perhaps the former Soviet president’s push for peace makes him right at home in Herzog’s gallery of underheralded visionaries. Herzog suggests to Gorbachev that the international mood is returning to a Cold War atmosphere. He replies, “I just wanted to say that Cold War cannot be a form of international relations. People who don’t understand the importance of cooperation and disarmament should quit politics.” (Subsequent to the film’s premiere last year, he criticized President Trump’s announcement of a withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.) The meat of the documentary consists of three sit-down interviews Herzog held with Gorbachev over half a year. Herzog begins by noting the cultural tension between them, given their home countries’ adversarial relationship in World War II. “The first German that you probably met wanted to kill you,” the filmmaker says, though Gorbachev denies it. The two men appear to like each other immensely — in narration, Herzog calls Gorbachev “one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century” — but Gorbachev can be a cool customer. He sometimes seems guarded in his assessment of what he might have done differently. He says he believes the Soviet Union should have given its republics more rights instead of dissolving entirely. As for Boris Yeltsin, who became the first president of a post-Soviet Russia, he says, “I should have sent him off somewhere.” But if “Meeting Gorbachev” finds its subject mostly staying on a pro-peace, antinuclear message — and it’s a script that’s hard to argue with — Herzog shapes the film into a study in how world events often come down to quirks of character and circumstance. To another leader, glasnost or perestroika would not have seemed like obvious policies. A thaw might never have happened. In a rundown of Soviet history before Gorbachev’s ascent, Herzog turns the successive funerals of the much older Soviet heads of state who preceded him into a grimly humorous recurring joke. (Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko all died within a three-year period.) Herzog suggests that even before his rise, Gorbachev was different in style from other Soviet leaders. Miklos Nemeth, who was prime minister of Hungary starting in 1988, says that when Gorbachev came to study Hungary’s agriculture, he was all business, with no interest in favors. Now 88, Gorbachev is still pithy, clear and direct in his answers. Herzog seems less in his element as an interviewer than he is when parsing historical footage, including musing on a brief handshake between Gorbachev and Reagan at their 1986 summit in Reykjavik. Herzog is particularly interested in Gorbachev’s legacy in Germany, where — according to the director — he is revered for allowing the country’s reunification to happen peacefully. Gorbachev pushes back at the notion that the Soviet Union’s end was somehow a triumph for the other side. “Americans thought they’d won the Cold War, and this went to their heads,” he says. “What victory? It was our joint victory. We all won.” Well, maybe not entirely — Vladimir V. Putin, pointedly absent from most of the film, is glimpsed in footage of Raisa Gorbachev’s funeral — but you come away from the movie agreeing with Herzog’s assessment, and yearning for Gorbachev’s brand of diplomacy.

Our residents overwhelmingly support such policies, both in word and in deed. In March 200,000 people marched in People First, a demonstration against all discrimination, and last month 70,000 people participated in a yearly parade that celebrates the heroes who liberated our city from Nazi Fascism.

2019,‘More Than Pretty Dances’: Alexei Ratmansky’s Alliance With Ballet Theater,"On a recent afternoon, the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky stood at the front of a large studio at American Ballet Theater, preparing to run through, “The Seasons,” his latest ballet for the company. He said a few final words to the dancers: “Remember, there is a mystery about the seasons, a divine energy. It’s more than pretty dances. There is an inescapable force that makes these things happen.” The dancers found their places, and the room went quiet. Then the rehearsal pianist, Jacek Mysinski, began to play the first glistening notes of the Glazunov score. The dances unspooled one after another with a kind of inexorable momentum: a small ensemble driven by the winter wind, a solo full of footwork as sharp as shards of ice. Each section embodied a quality drawn from nature; solos and duets highlighted the attributes of the individual dancers — boldness, sensuality, attack, lyricism. “The Seasons,” which is to have its premiere at Ballet Theater’s spring gala on May 20, is Mr. Ratmansky’s 16th ballet for the company, where he has been the artist in residence since 2009. In those 10 years, the dancers have grown conversant with his style, which combines a pliant use of legs with a mobile and free upper body; crisp, rhythmic attack coupled with melodic sweep. By now, some Ballet Theater dancers have spent their entire careers performing his dances; the famously difficult choreography has shaped their technique and stage personas. “The other day,” Kevin McKenzie, the company’s artistic director, said in his office near Union Square, “they were rehearsing ‘On the Dnieper’” — Ratmansky’s first ballet for the company, out of repertory for almost a decade — “and I asked myself, ‘Why does it look so different now?’” He said he realized that no one in that original cast had ever worked with Mr. Ratmansky — they were strangers to each other. But now “the ballet can come to to life in a way it never could have before,” Mr. McKenzie added. “Through working with him, the dancers have come to know themselves and what they’re capable of.” Mr. Ratmansky’s decade-long tenure at Ballet Theater is also the longest period he has spent in one place since leaving his home city of Kiev, Ukraine, for ballet school in Moscow. His career has zigzagged across continents and straddled the end of the Soviet Union: He went from Moscow back to Kiev; then Winnipeg, Canada; Copenhagen; and back to Moscow, where he directed the Bolshoi Ballet for five years beginning in 2004. After it was announced that he would be leaving the Bolshoi, he was in talks to join New York City Ballet, for whom he had already made a successful work, “Russian Seasons,” in 2006. (He has returned to the company several times since.) But when those negotiations fell through, Mr. McKenzie snapped into action, inviting him to come to Ballet Theater. His contract, renewed in 2011, runs through 2023. “I hope to have him here till 2053!” Mr. McKenzie said. A few days ago, Mr. Ratmansky, 50, reflected on his relationship to the company and to New York, and on his own evolution as a choreographer over the past decade. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. When you first came to Ballet Theater, did you think you would stay as long as you have? It’s surprising even to me! Before I came to New York there was a pattern in my life. Every six or seven years, or even less, I felt like I need to start anew. First, as a dancer, I was looking for interesting repertory, then I was looking for a place to choreograph. And then I was invited to direct the company in Moscow. But here, I can do what I love the most, serve the company and its needs, which is very important, but also pursue projects that are interesting and inspiring in other places. It feels like the right balance. How has your relationship with the dancers evolved over that time? The first experience with “On the Dnieper” [2009] we were trying to impress each other. The next one, “Seven Sonatas,” was probably the most difficult. It was like we didn’t understand each other. I think it was about breaking old habits. What changed? Before my eyes, the company switched its focus, from a company of international stars to a real company with its own dancers. I think it was a healthy transition. It took time to give fruit and I think it’s beginning to pay off. There are dancers in the company now, like Catherine Hurlin and Tyler Maloney, who I’ve worked with since they were kids in the company school. They understand my style really well. What aspects of New York have fed your imagination? Exhibitions. The Metropolitan Museum. Sometimes I go every week. Lately I’ve mostly been visiting the Roman and Greek antiquities. And the Asian collection. You can keep going back for years and always discover new things. What about dance — what do you like to see? I’ve developed an interest in Indian classical dance. It’s about the way they tell stories. There are parallels with classical ballet — the way they subdivide dance into pure dance, expressive dance, like ballet d’action in ballet, and pure mime. They have it all. In New York I’ve really had the chance to see amazing classical Indian dancers. Do you feel like an American now? I do. But in my life I’ve been from somewhere so many times. At the Bolshoi school I was from Kiev. In Kiev, I was from the Bolshoi School. Then in Canada, my wife, Tatiana, and I were from Ukraine; in Denmark we were Russian. In Moscow we were from Denmark. My roots are Russian Jewish, and my native language and schooling is Russian. But I vote in New York. So that’s the mixed salad. In your time here, you’ve worked with both Ballet Theater, your home, and City Ballet. Do you choreograph differently for the two companies? I think that you come into the studio and see the dancers and you play to their strengths. City Ballet is a unique company, because of the Balanchine technique. They have that speed and musicality. Ballet Theater is a bit more like a traditional European opera house with different ballets, different styles and a more traditional ballet hierarchy with principal dancers at the center of a big work. Is there something you’ve created over this past decade that feels particularly significant to you? I think I would say the “Shostakovich Trilogy” [2013]. It sums up my very old love for Shostakovich’s music and, in some way, my connection to my Soviet upbringing. It’s a very personal work. But it’s also symphonic in scale. I love the fact that it’s a full ballet but that each section can be performed independently. How do you think you have evolved as a choreographer over these 10 years? At the moment I’m under the influence of classicism. There was a time when I tried to develop my own language, but it felt limiting. Now I think it’s all right to use the classical vocabulary. Because it works. Hundreds of thousands of dancers every day do these exercises, which are full of beautiful, effective steps, refined by generations and generations. Since arriving in New York, you’ve made ballets to Shostakovich, Leonid Desyatnikov, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and other Russians. What keeps bringing you back to this music? I know it better, and maybe it’s in the blood, I don’t know. Maybe it’s my upbringing. It’s not a nationalistic thing, it’s just that the pool is so rich. I have a list of music that I want to use, but I’m nearing the end of it. I’d like to choreograph more to Leonard Bernstein; I think he is remarkable. And I love baroque music, and French music. You’ve recently begun restaging works by the 19th-century choreographer Marius Petipa, using archival materials. What spurred this new interest? Partly because I think it’s not right to overwhelm the repertory of the company with my own work. This encouraged my interest in staging classics, which is completely different from my own work. Even though my taste as a choreographer is of course reflected in the reconstructions that I do. They’re my productions, but the choreography is Petipa. It’s more Petipa than other productions of Petipa! These productions also inspire my original work. “The Seasons” definitely feels inspired by Petipa; do you think of it as an extension of your exploration of his style? Yes! The music, by Alexander Glazunov, was composed for Petipa. I took Petipa’s plan for the ballet and thought, it works perfectly. It’s all very clearly laid out. The number of soloists and groups, the kids. Also, when Petipa made it he was working as a ballet master in chief, showing off the company. And that’s what I wanted to do. I wanted to celebrate the company and use as many soloists as I could. The other thing I wanted to celebrate with this ballet is the classical vocabulary. That’s my little secret celebration. In 2009, when you became artist in residence at Ballet Theater, you barely knew the company. What made you take the job? It was something like destiny, from my point of view. When the negotiations with N.Y.C.B. fell apart, the next morning I got a call from Kevin inviting me. It was something I didn’t expect at all. He took a leap of faith. Another moment was when I first visited A.B.T. studios and I was introduced to the company. They didn’t know me. They had never worked with me. But they trusted me. And that’s really important. When you feel that, you want to serve.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Mostly Dead Things,’ a Story of Taxidermy, Love and Grief, With Echoes of Past Literary Heroines","Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Eden of dangerous things,” the novelist Lauren Groff once described Florida. Zora Neale Hurston famously wrote of the “ground so rich that everything went wild” — not least the writers themselves. What other state so reliably produces such rowdy, uninhibited imaginations? Hurston, Kelly Link, Karen Russell, Alissa Nutting, Laura van den Berg, Jennine Capó Crucet. They have created a literature full of mirages and (actual) sinkholes, poised on the hazy borders between man and nature, ripeness and rot, tragedy and gag. And life and death, in the case of Kristen Arnett’s “Mostly Dead Things,” an irresistible first novel set in the hard sunshine and “juicy green” of Central Florida, featuring a family of taxidermists, suicides and ruthless intimacies. A clan after Diane Arbus’s very heart. “I must go home periodically to renew my sense of horror,” Carson McCullers once wrote. Jessa-Lynn Morton, Arnett’s narrator, never left. She never had that option. She was too much in love — never mind that it was with her brother’s wife; Jessa-Lynn was loved fiercely in return. Pretty, predatory Brynn was used to getting what she wanted, and what she wanted was both Morton siblings — together, they made the perfect spouse — until she wanted neither of them, and packed up for good. That was the first defection. The second was gory. Jessa-Lynn’s father killed himself in his workshop, leaving his daughter to discover his body and inherit his failing taxidermy business. It’s here that the novel opens, in the months after the suicide. We meet Jessa-Lynn, shattered and up late, anesthetized on cheap beer, hands moving on autopilot as she restores the dignity to tattered pieces of roadkill. Drunken taxidermy turns out to be a respectful route. Jessa-Lynn’s formerly mild mother, Libby, has forged her own inventive way to process her pain. She takes her husband’s meticulously preserved animals and forces them to strike some very curious poses in the front window of the shop. Badgers grope rabbits. A raccoon sports a satin negligee and demure bridal veil. Libby plans an exhibition of them that “highlights similarities between sex acts in the animal kingdom and those in modern suburbia,” she calmly explains to her horrified children. “Specifically correlations to myself and my late husband, Prentice.” These are parched, grieving people, whose need is so enormous they cannot begin to discern what they might actually want; they make outlandish gestures or freeze into passivity. Jessa-Lynn is only really conscious for the first dread-filled seconds of each day, as she braces herself to register the impact of the oncoming hangover. But Arnett possesses all the bravery her characters dream of. There’s none of the shyness and self-consciousness of so much American fiction that masks itself as austerity. She writes comic set pieces to make you laugh, sex scenes to turn you on. The action flips from the past to the present, swimming through first love and first grief on a slick of red Kool-Aid and vodka, suntan oil and fruity lip gloss, easy and unforced. This book is my song of the summer. Corner me, though, and I’ll admit that it suffers slightly from some first-novel blues. The setup is expert, but the pace occasionally stutters. The climax feels rushed and muted, the resolution a little pat. Not that it matters much; in fiction as much as taxidermy, it is the feeling of vigor and spirit that matters, that is proof of success. And the pulse in this book emanates not only from its sun-drunk, word-drunk wit, but from what it knows about life. Arnett’s characters suffer because they remember. Memories of happiness can be a kind of torture, and memory itself can feel seditious in a place so committed to forgetting. “It was what Central Floridians did: pave over everything so they could forget what had been there before,” Arnett writes. The land of the Seminoles was turned to carnival lots, supermarkets, strip malls. “No one ever seemed to remember what came before,” Jessa-Lynn marvels. “A kind of local amnesia.” This is a novel that remembers in other ways, too — there are literary bloodlines to be traced. Young Jessa-Lynn standing rapt at her father’s side as he teaches her to skin a buck, her bonds with the men in her family, recalls Scout in “To Kill a Mockingbird.” In her youthful loneliness and self-sufficiency, she is a ghost of Bone from Dorothy Allison’s “Bastard Out of Carolina.” In her love for her brother and his wife, there is a feeling of Frankie from McCullers’s “The Member of the Wedding.” Later, when Jessa-Lynn develops a crush on an older, elegant woman, I sensed strains of Patricia Highsmith’s “The Price of Salt.” Subtly, unmistakably a beautiful lineage is suggested in these echoes of the great heroines of American literature — so many tomboys, so many queer women. Their shadows flicker, trailing between the alligator jaws and deer hooves and peacock feathers in this book of inheritances, this cabinet of wonders.",The New York Times
2019,‘My Fair Lady’ to Close on Broadway in July,"Nominated for 10 Tony Awards, the Lerner and Loewe musical will begin a national tour and may play London. A Broadway revival of “My Fair Lady” will close on July 7, about 16 months after it began performances. The widely praised revival, produced by the nonprofit Lincoln Center Theater, was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, but won only for its costume design. At a moment when the gender politics of classic musicals came under new scrutiny, it managed to reframe the relationship between the flower seller Eliza Doolittle and her mentor, Henry Higgins. The show was grossing more than $1 million a week for much of its run, but recently has softened at the box office, last week pulling in $773,979. Lincoln Center’s production is the fifth Broadway edition of the beloved musical, which first opened in 1956. The show, based on George Bernard Shaw’s “Pygmalion,” features music by Frederick Loewe, with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner. Bartlett Sher is the director. At the time of its closing, it will have played 548 performances. A national tour is scheduled to begin in Syracuse and then at the Kennedy Center in Washington; Lincoln Center Theater said it also expected to present the revival in London’s West End. The revival opened with Lauren Ambrose as Eliza; the role is now played by Laura Benanti.",The New York Times
2019,‘My Life is Connected to the Most Miserable Things That Can Happen to Others’,"at war [At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Friday.] On Easter Sunday, as I was getting ready to go on an egg hunt with my wife and two boys, suicide bombers struck at half a dozen churches and hotels across Sri Lanka. The first reports indicated many people had been killed. I live in New Delhi, India, and I’m the bureau chief of this region. Within an hour or so, it was clear that I needed to go. You might think this would happen more often in our business, that we foreign correspondents have a bag hanging from a hook in our office and a wad of cash and passport all lined up and we are accustomed to some huge news event upending our lives. But I’ve been doing this for 20 years and I’ve never gotten used to it. These moments always fill me with dread, this cold, spreading, uncomfortable realization that my life is connected to the most miserable things that can happen to others, and I’ve never felt excited about leaving my family to jump off into the bottomless void of some huge story. No matter how important it is, I always wish it never happened and that I could just stay home. I spent the next hours in a low level panic, the acid rising in my throat, trying to write different versions of a news story though my fingers weren’t cooperating and felt thick. My mind was so divided that when I yanked open the sock drawer I stood paralyzed for a few moments, unable to decide which ones to take. Like any of this matters, I said to myself. But still, I couldn’t decide. It was in this completely stressed out state that I arrived several hours later in Colombo, Sri Lanka’s capital. My disquiet and stress were nothing compared to what people here were suffering. In the first days after these attacks, there was some doubt about who did this. The Sri Lankan authorities initially believed the attacks were the work of an obscure homegrown Islamist group with possible foreign connections. Walking up to that church erased any doubts I had. The high cathedral ceiling had been blown off and red roofing tiles lay scattered everywhere. All around me, the walls had been drilled by shrapnel, and blood was splattered 20 feet high. Standing there, I had a flashback: The headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Erbil, Iraq, 2004. That was the first suicide bombing I covered and I’ll never be able to forget it. Al Qaeda agents had planned the attack to happen during a busy Muslim holiday. The carnage was devastating. Never before did I appreciate how fragile we are as human beings, no match for the forces of physics. People are not supposed to be smeared across walls like flies. I stepped into that room as one person. I came out as another. Whoever built the bomb that tore through St. Sebastian’s Church had a similar expertise to the bombmakers in Iraq. The initial reports said one man, with a backpack, had walked into the Easter Mass. I knew that only an experienced bombmaker — an experienced mass murderer — could have packed so much explosive into a relatively small device. In recent days, more evidence has emerged linking the Sri Lanka attacks to the Islamic State. That organization might seem so far away and abstract. But the point that the Islamic State clearly wanted to make, not so much in Sri Lanka but through Sri Lanka, was that no matter where you are or what you’re doing, you are never safe. For U.S. Commandos in the Philippines, a Water Pump Is a New Weapon Against ISIS: A water pump is linked to the defeat of the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq and Syria and the Pentagon’s race to stop the group’s resurgence in other parts of the globe. Pentagon Survey Finds a Surge in Sexual Assaults in the Ranks: Troops in all branches of the military, and especially women, are suffering more unwanted sexual contacts and are less likely to report them, the survey found. U.S. Military Stops Counting How Much of Afghanistan Is Controlled by Taliban: “It’s like turning off the scoreboard,” one American official said of the decision, which eliminates an important public measure of progress in the war. ISIS’ Mysterious Leader Is Not Dead, New Video Shows: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared on video for the first time in five years, reasserting authority in the wake of lost territory and a major attack in Sri Lanka. Gaslighting an Entire Nation: The U.S. usually underreports civilian deaths caused by its airstrikes. Proving it in Somalia is uniquely difficult. Things ‘Stopped Changing’: Why Conflict Still Flares in Northern Ireland: The killing of a young journalist has brought renewed focus on the region’s paramilitary groups. But economic stagnation is as much a driver of violence as politics.

2019,Opinion | ‘My Mother Called This Male Pattern of Behavior “Creative Incompetence”’,"How do you feel about the division of labor in your home? Readers share their views. Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. “The optimistic tale of the modern, involved dad has been greatly exaggerated,” writes Darcy Lockman in her essay “What ‘Good’ Dads Get Away With.” Dr. Lockman laments that while men in contemporary society are now viewed as participating equitably in child care and household duties, research shows that women still do significantly more work at home. This can cost them leisure time, professional gains and a sense of satisfaction in their partnerships. “My mother called this male pattern of behavior ‘creative incompetence,’” wrote beeceenj, a reader in New Jersey. Dr. Lockman’s essay stirred a hornet’s nest of commentary among readers. Some men denied culpability, while others admitted to naïveté about how much work their wives or partners managed daily. For women, reactions ranged from the resignation of an overtired working mom to feelings of vindication for some whose struggles with the issue led to divorce. More responses from readers are below. They have been edited for length and clarity. My wife of 56 years and I figured we had a good system. But then she developed severe dementia and I took over taking care of the house, shopping, dinner, etc., while also taking care of her. It was this that opened my eyes and haunts me with guilt — the realization of how much she did for years and held a job to boot. — GTUZ, Algonac, Mich. My husband and I would have told you we were splitting the work equally after we had our kids, but we were both fooling ourselves. When they were toddlers, I got a time-consuming promotion and his employer went out of business. He took a year off to stay home with them and that’s when we found out I was doing a ton more than he was. He didn’t even realize that I was doing this stuff, and I didn’t realize how tired, frustrated and unhappy I had become. He stepped up in a big way, got out of his comfort zone, made mistakes, learned. To those who think this article is fluff — it ain’t. It’s real, insidious and a big deal. And men — if you think it’s not having an impact on your marriage, you’re wrong. — July, Massachusetts [The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Visit NYT Parenting for everything you need to raise thriving babies and kids.] I am a lesbian and a feminist. While I agree that women are suffering and men must do more, to some degree, women are their own worst enemies. I work in a department that is 90 percent women. So often they demand more of themselves than is necessary, to the point of actually becoming less efficient. Is this the same issue in heterosexual households, especially those with children? I often hear women complain about how their husbands or male partners don’t do enough to help, and if they do help, the work wasn’t done right. I would be annoyed if my wife told me repeatedly that my efforts hadn’t lived up to her expectations. In my opinion, this is nothing more than internalized misogyny. — Elizabeth Salzer, New York, N.Y. Women have to become more selfish. Don’t volunteer for unrewarding projects at work; don’t ‘mother’ the men in your life; don’t pick up the slack when they fail. Men are neither stupid nor incompetent. They’re just pushing the envelope to see what they can get away with. You’ll be surprised how well things turn out for you. — Sophie K, New York Most men I know don’t even know what a fair share looks like. It’s not about doing; it’s about entering into a world of care. Men have long been taught that they don’t need to bother with those things because someone else will. We men are so happy to live up to this idea of male incompetence — and then get angry and defensive when called on it. — Mike, Milwaukee My wife was a stay-at-home mom. But in the evenings, I bathed our young kids because I wanted to. I also helped clean the kitchen and did house maintenance. Thirty years later, with my wife fighting cancer, I continue to do that stuff, plus cook and go to the grocery store. I go to every appointment with her and work remotely from her bedside when she’s getting chemotherapy. I pay the bills, putting in 50- to 60-hour weeks. I’m not asking for sympathy. I’m asking to end this stereotyping of men as lazy avoiders of family work. It’s a popular sitcom theme that is played far too much in syndication. — Once From Rome, Pittsburgh This is about control. Men will share the responsibilities but women won’t relinquish when and how it is done. Wanting help is one thing and fair to expect, but micromanaging how it is received is quite another. This is quite often about men being made to feel incompetent for not meeting niggling details. — TD, Indy When I went back to work after having our second kid, I was dismayed and furious at how my super-aware, unsexist husband just simply didn’t do his share. It didn’t matter that we worked similar jobs with similar hours and pay. Worse, he wouldn’t acknowledge he wasn’t doing his share, even though he really did know it. I spent four years angry every day because I loved him, had no interest in divorce, and it simply didn’t matter what I said or did. Four years later, we share duties 60/40, with him doing 60 percent. What changed? I stopped cooking and grocery shopping and he slowly took them on. Most men don’t find cooking demeaning, and giving him an area where I never second-guessed him and was always supportive helped enormously. — A, U.S.A. My friends and I are the breadwinners in our families and often work more hours than our husbands, but we also manage the majority of the household tasks. An important and overlooked contributor to this imbalance is the way that maternity and paternity leave are structured. My friends and I had time off, while our husbands did not. Most of us took care of feeding the baby, doing the baby’s laundry, arranging doctor appointments. When we went back to work, those tasks did not suddenly get divided in half. — KEB, Denver The Pew research the author cites also highlights that fathers, including myself, feel that despite increasing their participation in household work over the last decade, they are still either not spending enough time with their kids or are less confident about their ability to care for them. Rather than asking fathers to “stop resisting,” I would ask the author to consider why this gap exists between a father’s desired outcomes and actual outcomes. — Huanlei, Vienna, Va. Getting a divorce worked like a charm in evening the division of labor. My ex-husband and I split the kids’ time equally between our households, meaning that now he actually has to do half the child care and all his own housework. He never took seriously how being stuck with the lion’s share of housework ate away at my mental health. Realizing what a toll it took on my happiness makes me extremely reluctant to ever engage in another romantic relationship. — OCPA, California When the baby came along, he decided that it was only fair that I should shoulder the greater child care burden since he was earning a larger share of our income. My paycheck would never be equal to his. I fell further and further behind him in my earnings, and his participation in child care dropped from little to nothing. While it was an obviously untenable situation for me, my husband was taken completely by surprise when I filed for divorce. — Kathleen L., Los Angeles I gave up on trying to get my husband to do more. Recently, he’s started earning more money than me. I’m letting that be his contribution and am relaxing on my monetary contribution. I just can’t fight a war on all fronts anymore. So we’re in a more “traditional” marriage than I thought we’d be. I’m too tired to make it anything else. — Kay gee, San Francisco The 5:40 a.m. train into New York is always 85 to 100 percent men. It is a dark, depressing, exhausting experience for everyone, but it’s treated as an assumed obligation that we are expected to make for our families. When the gender disparity balances out on the early train, I will be a lot more open to discussing gender imbalances in tasks that women get disproportionately tagged with. — JSD, New York In my LGBTQ home, men have done the work over the last 30 years, or it did not get done. But we have similar discussions, using many of the same words, about a fair distribution of responsibility. It would be interesting to read about families from different cultures, especially those that appear to be closer to equity. — David, Portland, Ore. I’m a gay dad but this article mirrors my experience with my husband. He is a Type A personality at work, but at home he will do a chore only if it is explicitly assigned to him. He rarely looks around and thinks, “Oh, it’s 10 p.m. and the kids are still awake” — despite being an affectionate, involved parent. We worked it out. We’ve assigned him some chores and we have biweekly check-ins where he asks me what I’m stressed about and how he can help. Overall, I view our difference as a yin-yang balance that we both maintain. — John, Austin, Texas Honestly I feel that my husband and I split things evenly. One thing that helps is we are both extremely comfortable ignoring our children and expecting them to just play. The entertaining of preschoolers is a job no parent actually has to do. — KMD, Denver My husband and I both work full time. From my own experience, men have the capacity to be completely oblivious to the existence of their children. Mothers have what I think of as a “kid antenna” — always tuned into recognizing any need a child may have. I imagine that some dads have this antenna; mine doesn’t. Having realized this has been most helpful in reining in my expectations. — M.B., St. Louis Maybe men are slobs, but I honestly think one reason women do more housework is because they choose to. I never let the kids go hungry or sent them to school in rags, and we were in absolutely no danger of being reported for child endangerment. But my wife did not think I was doing well enough. Over the years, I have raised my standards a bit and my wife has relaxed hers a bit. We manage. — J, QC My wife, generally with good intent, promises me she’ll wash those dishes but then leaves them in the sink until I get frustrated and do them myself. And then I read an article that is saying, statistically, I am the problem. — Jason, Midwest My wife and I have a Google spreadsheet of every task for each day of the week. We split that spreadsheet between the two of us and ensure a 50-50 split. Ultimately, each party in a relationship believes they are doing more than what is reality and that the other is doing less than what is reality. The only way to ensure a fair division of labor is to document it, agree to it and stick to it. — RA, Austin, Texas We, as a society, undervalue the importance of housework to our overall happiness and ability to function. Domestic labor is boring and thankless, but when done well, it contributes to a sense of stability and well-being for everyone in the household. I think every family would be well served to agree on what kind of home they want to create together. — Rani Batra, Oakland, Calif.

2019,"‘My Son’ Review: When His Boy Goes Missing, a Father Unravels","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. An endorsement of milquetoast vigilantism that’s not nearly as knotty as it presumes to be, the French thriller “My Son” is so reserved in its storytelling and vague in its details that all it elicits is a yawn. Directed by Christian Carion, the movie begins with a disappearance. Mathys, the 7-year-old son of a separated couple, Julien (Guillaume Canet) and Marie (Mélanie Laurent), has gone missing from a campsite. Julien, whose frequent travel strained his marriage, is impatient with the police. He begins to suspect that something is amiss with Grégoire (Olivier de Benoist), Marie’s new boyfriend, who appears unusually upbeat about his and Marie’s plans for the future, despite the tenseness of the moment. Very little in “My Son” — whether it’s the logistics of the kidnapping or the way Julien scours home videos for convenient clues — makes a great deal of sense, perhaps as a consequence of the shooting process. (Supposedly the movie was filmed in six days, with Canet uninformed about particulars so that he could uncover evidence in the same state of ignorance as Julien.) But the efforts to transform “My Son” into a character study — the ambitious Julien is suddenly shunned by his police-averse employer — largely fall flat. What could inspire an ordinary man to pick up a golf club or a blowtorch and start saying things like “You won’t talk? Then I’ll fry your face”? Somehow, “My Son” makes even that scene dull.

2019,"‘No One Would Listen’: Cleared of Murder, After 33 Years in Prison","Keith Bush was arrested at 17 for a crime he always insisted he had not committed. On Wednesday, a judge threw out the murder conviction. He’s 62. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] For four decades, Keith Bush insisted he had been convicted as a teenager of a murder he did not commit: strangling a 14-year-old girl in Bellport, N.Y. The police, he said, had beaten him and forced him to sign a confession that he had never read. While imprisoned, he had enlisted the help of a lawyer at Pace Law School, who sued to obtain records and unearthed evidence showing Mr. Bush had not gotten a fair trial. Even after he was released from state prison on parole, Mr. Bush continued to fight to clear his name. On Wednesday morning, 44 years after his arrest, Mr. Bush was exonerated in Suffolk County District Court in Riverhead, Long Island. The Suffolk County district attorney, Timothy D. Sini, asked a judge to throw out the conviction, saying prosecutors never told the defense the police had interviewed another possible culprit. “I cannot give you that which was taken from you in the 1970s, but what I can restore to you today is your presumption of innocence,” Judge Anthony Senft Jr. told Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush, now 62, wore just a hint of a smile. “I am truly humbled by this decision,” he said. He told the judge he had lived a long time in pain. “No one would listen,” he said. “No one would at least hear me out.” Mr. Bush was only 17 years old in 1975 when he was charged with the murder of Sherese Watson, a teenager who never returned home from a house party in Bellport, N.Y. She was found in a vacant lot, strangled and sexually abused. Mr. Bush was arrested four days later and signed a confession to the crime. At trial, the jury believed the confession, though he insisted from the outset it had been coerced. Another partygoer who had testified she saw Mr. Bush leave with the victim that night recanted her testimony at a hearing five years later, saying she had never even been to the party. But it did not lead to a new trial. In 2006, Mr. Bush wrote to Adele Bernhard, then a lawyer running a clinic at Pace Law School, from the Green Haven Correctional Facility in upstate New York. He was innocent, he said, and he hoped she would help him prove it. He had written similar letters to other lawyers. Ms. Bernhard was interested in his case immediately, she said, after reading the statement he had signed. “It was internally inconsistent,” she said. “The facts that they put in it, the words that they use, none of it rang true.” His statement did not match forensic evidence about how the girl had died, she said. Ms. Bernhard discovered that the DNA underneath the victim’s fingernails did not match a sample Mr. Bush had given in prison. She also re-interviewed the witness who had recanted her testimony about seeing Mr. Bush with Ms. Watson at the party. But a judge denied her 2008 motion to vacate the conviction, and turned down her request for additional testing on clothes and other crime-scene evidence. Ms. Bernhard persevered. Over the next decade, she went back to key witnesses, analyzed fiber evidence, pored over the confession and did more research on the detectives involved. She also filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to obtain records of the case. Those records contained evidence that the police had another possible suspect for Ms. Watson’s murder — another young man at the party named John W. Jones Jr. In a statement, Mr. Jones, who has since died, told the police he had stumbled over Ms. Watson’s body in the empty lot after leaving the party drunk, Mr. Sini said. He also said a comb found next to her body looked like one he had dropped. Mr. Bush’s defense lawyer at the 1976 trial had never been told about Mr. Jones’s statements, a clear violation of evidence rules. In 2018, Ms. Bernhard took the records to Mr. Sini, who had just been elected on a reform platform and had established a Conviction Integrity Bureau to review such cases. Mr. Sini, who personally appeared in court to ask the judge to vacate Mr. Bush’s conviction, said the existence of an alternative suspect should have been disclosed before trial. He said the prosecutors had engaged in a deliberate cover up. “Mistakes happen in all aspects of our lives,” he said at a news conference. “But there was intentional misconduct here.” Mr. Sini said his office’s nine-month review of the case confirmed several other problems with the case. The key witness who recanted her testimony was never seen at the party. And Mr. Bush’s description in his confession — that he had stabbed Ms. Watson with a Afro-pick comb before she died — did not fit the forensic evidence, because very little blood was found on her white sweater. One of the former detectives who obtained the confession had alluded to using coercive tactics, and another had been repeatedly cited for misconduct in other cases, Mr. Sini said in a news release. “At the end of the day, we came to some very simple conclusions,” Mr. Sini said. “We don’t believe Mr. Bush committed this murder. We believe Mr. Bush was denied a fair trial. And we believe that John Jones is a more probable suspect in this crime.” Mr. Bush was released from prison on parole in 2007, about a month before his 50th birthday, and had to register as a sex offender, he said. He served another year in 2013 on a parole violation, for using a computer with internet access. He got a job in Connecticut as a forklift operator and is now engaged to be married. When asked how he contains his anger, Mr. Bush said he does not. “You don’t hold it back, you create outlets to release it,” he said. “And one of the greatest outlets is love.” He added, “When you have the love of people that care about you, it enables you to release the pain.” When asked whether he had ever considered giving up trying to clear his name, he answered with a straight face. “I don’t know what that means,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Non-Fiction’ Review: Sex Comedy Disguised as Tech Treatise, or Vice Versa?","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. During my first viewing of Olivier Assayas’s “Non-Fiction” — sometime last year, it must have been — I was a little puzzled about exactly when the story was supposed to be taking place. Was it right now, or now-ish or at some point in the recent past? The main topic of conversation among the film’s culturally sophisticated, economically privileged characters is the impact of digital technology on media and the arts, literature in particular. The movie follows two Parisian couples in which the husbands are connected to the world of publishing. Alain (Guillaume Canet) is an editor, and Léonard (Vincent Macaigne) is a novelist. They meet for lunch and the topic of blogging comes up, as it does later at a dinner party, which made me think it must be 2005 or so. That’s when blogs were a thing, right? But maybe it’s different in France. Other conversations touch on the rise of e-books, which maybe happened a little later. But everyone in the movie seems to have at least one smartphone, and Twitter and other social media platforms are mentioned from time to time. So are “le streaming,” “post-truth” and “fake news” (using the English words). Also “autofiction,” “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and “The White Ribbon,” a movie that won at Cannes in 2009. No political or other news events that might provide some kind of chronological orientation are cited. I’ve come to believe that this confusion, this feeling of scrambling through an indeterminate, unstable present, is part of the film’s point. Alain, Léonard and others in their circle are preoccupied with — and have varying professional stakes in — the enormous changes that have already happened or are just about to happen. Alain is married to Selena (Juliette Binoche), an actress on a popular television series. Léonard’s wife, Valérie (Nora Hamzawi), works for a socialist politician. Their jobs, like their husbands, are in flux. Whether with grim resignation, shrugging amusement or evangelical zeal, everyone declares that everything is different, everything is new. Now and then, someone will demur: “But some things don’t change.” The second time I saw this witty, intelligent, sometimes cryptic movie — all synonyms for “un film d’Olivier Assayas” — those were the things I noticed. It’s easy to get so caught up in what these highly articulate people are saying (especially when you’re reading subtitles) that you don’t always notice what they’re doing. In the vast majority of scenes, Assayas stages his arguments about the digital future in bars, restaurants and cafes, over informal dinners or hasty breakfasts. Or else, a bit less often, in stretches of pre- or postcoital discourse. People almost always meet at table or in bed, and in one case both at once, thanks to hotel room service. (The frites look delicious.) There are maybe 10 minutes out of 108 that don’t involve the immediate prospect of eating, drinking or sex. That’s what doesn’t change. This is a French movie. The original French title of “Non-Fiction” means “Double Lives,” and it captures the existential split that afflicts Valérie, Selena, Léonard and Alain. They dwell in a virtual world of data, social networks and endless quantification, a world that feeds their appetites for abstraction and disputation. But of course they also have other appetites. Either this is a comedy of adultery disguised as a meditation on the future of civilization, or the reverse. It’s pretty good fun either way, though it’s also very much a symptom of the condition it diagnoses, namely the profound complacency of the cultural elite (in France, but of course not only in France). Léonard exercises the novelist’s prerogatives of narcissism and self-pity. He publishes barely disguised accounts of his own erotic adventures, including with Selena, who wonders if her cop-show gig is somehow beneath her. Alain, who can argue three sides of any question, drifts into an affair with Laure (Christa Théret), a young digital disrupter hired by his company to shake it up. The fact that Valérie, who works in politics, is the least cynical, most ethical player in this game counts as a sly joke. Her job, which takes her away from Paris, gestures toward a dimension of reality that lies beyond the hermetic concerns of the others. Not that “Non-Fiction” really goes there. That hermeticism is both its subject and its method. There’s no way for Assayas to establish any satirical distance from his characters. His intimate, streamlined shooting style and the unaffected precision of the performances places us squarely in their midst. This may be insufferable or delightful or — this was my experience — both. These people are exasperating! Half of what they say is utter nonsense! But to react this way is to recognize them, and therefore to be implicated their vanity, their duplicity and their self-delusion. It’s not always a comfortable position to be in. It’s a little too real. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘Not Just a Maid’: The Ultra-Running Domestic Workers of Hong Kong,"HONG KONG — Six days a week, Jaybie Pagarigan cooks, cleans and shops for her employers, a family in Hong Kong. Then on Sundays — her one day off — she hits the trails. Traversing the city’s lush and vast country parks, the 39-year-old domestic worker from the Philippines clocks in miles of running and thousands of feet in elevation as she conquers one peak after another. Ms. Pagarigan is part of a growing community of maids in Hong Kong who have taken up trail running for the challenge of the sport and the opportunity to be treated as equals in a society that often discriminates against them. In addition to long work days, one-day weekends and an exhaustive list of responsibilities, these domestic workers somehow find the time and energy to compete in mountain ultramarathons. They squeeze in training runs before the crack of dawn or late at night, and find creative ways to turn their household duties into training opportunities. On a recent spring Sunday, Ms. Pagarigan stood under overcast skies at the starting line of the King of the Hills Hong Kong Island race, part of one of the city’s oldest trail-running series. She was there to race the sprint distance, 11.5 miles. At 4 feet 11 inches, Ms. Pagarigan was head and shoulders shorter than some of the men around her. But she had a look of steely resolve as she gazed into the distance, hopping on her toes to keep warm as the race director waited for a thunderstorm warning to be lifted so the race could start. Ms. Pagarigan was not familiar with the course and did not quite know what to expect. But she did know that there would be stairs, lots of stairs, and that her legs would burn more than her lungs would. She also knew that she had hours of training behind her, and that “it’s better to not know what’s in front of you,” she said. She ended up finishing the race in just under three hours, a result that disappointed her. The morning’s rainstorms had made the trails slick with mud and she had fallen twice. Her friend, Fredelyn Alberto, 30, a fellow Filipino domestic worker, came third in the full race of 21.5 miles. Ms. Alberto has established herself as one of the city’s rising female trail runners after a string of podium finishes, including winning a 27.9-mile ultramarathon in January. Ms. Pagarigan ran her first ultramarathon in February, a grueling race covering 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, and she is training for several more. When they are not on the trails, Ms. Pagarigan and Ms. Alberto are among Hong Kong’s 380,000 foreign maids, who make up 5 percent of the population but play an outsize role in the city’s economy. Foreign maids first arrived in the city in the 1970s, when there was a shortage of local full-time housekeepers as the economy began to take off in line with China’s opening up. The steady flow of migrant workers has allowed large numbers of local women to stay in the work force and has paved the way for Hong Kong’s transformation into a thriving service economy. Last year alone, foreign maids added $12.6 billion to the city’s gross domestic product, according to a recent report by Enrich, a nonprofit that works on the welfare of migrant workers in Hong Kong, and by Experian, a credit reporting bureau. And yet the workers often face discriminatory treatment. The authorities have denied foreign maids the right to apply for permanent residency and have mandated that they must live in their employers’ homes — an arrangement critics argue increases the risk of abuse. It is not uncommon for domestic workers to be made to sleep in bathrooms, storage rooms or closets. Trail running has emerged as something of an unlikely equalizer for domestic workers. For at least a few hours, the sweat and camaraderie of the trails blur the lines between employers and maids, and among locals, migrants and expatriates. “On weekdays, people say, ‘Oh, you’re a domestic helper,’” Ms. Alberto said. “On weekends, on the trails, they say, ‘Oh, you’re a good runner.’” “It’s amazing,” she added. The sport is one of several ways that foreign domestic workers are reclaiming their voices and a sense of agency in a city where they are often expected to be subservient and virtually invisible. For Ms. Pagarigan, the King of the Hills race was just the start of her day. Afterward, she dashed to a graduation ceremony for a course on money management offered by Uplifters, a nonprofit group that offers online education to migrant workers. Later that afternoon, she led a hike as a volunteer for a local trekking group. In all, in her one day off from work, she covered 15 miles and 4,500 feet. Ms. Pagarigan said that trail running sends an important message: “We’re not just a maid. We’re not just poor people.” A typical day for her begins at 4:30 a.m., when she slips out of her employer’s apartment for a “sunrise jog,” a five-mile round-trip run to the summit of nearby Mount Butler, a 1,430-foot peak. One perk of Hong Kong’s hyperdensity is that its verdant jungles are nearby, making the city’s vast network of trails accessible to almost anyone. By 6 a.m., Ms. Pagarigan is back at the apartment, putting breakfast together and getting her employer’s two toddlers, ages 3 and 4, ready for school. Then she cleans the house, does the laundry, prepares lunch and picks the children up from school at half past noon. Twice a week, she heads to the market just down the hill to buy fresh produce. But it is no ordinary errand. To get to the market, a quarter-mile away, she runs a large loop around the neighborhood with her market trolley in tow to add on mileage. At the market, she fills the trolley with vegetables, meat and fish. Then she runs back, carrying a load that she estimates can be up to 22 pounds. Finally, she runs up the stairs to the apartment on the 18th floor. Ms. Pagarigan’s workday ends when her employer returns home from work, around dinner time. This is when she heads out for her second run of the day, a six mile jog along the harbor front. Sometimes, if her employers notice that she has stayed in her bedroom and not gone out for her night run, they message her to ask if everything is O.K. “They’re very flexible, supportive, helpful,” Ms. Pagarigan said of her employers. She said she felt lucky because it was rare for a domestic worker in Hong Kong to have her own bedroom and employers who actively encourage her athletic pursuits. Many domestic workers endure poor living conditions, and restrictive visa rules make them particularly vulnerable to exploitation by employers and job agencies. Some venues, like private clubs, bar domestic workers from certain areas or even entire premises. “This is sad but this is reality — that when you say you’re a domestic helper, you’re a small thing,” said Dolly Vargas Salles, 40, a fellow trail runner and maid from the Philippines. “But for me, no. I can live as who I am,” she said. “This is what trail running has done for me.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Nothing Has Been Done’: Khashoggi’s Fiancée Urges Action Against Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON — Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of the slain columnist Jamal Khashoggi, implored lawmakers in wrenching testimony on Thursday to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for his death. Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident who lived in Virginia and wrote for The Washington Post, disappeared in October after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents needed for his impending marriage to Ms. Cengiz. Turkish intelligence later concluded that Saudi agents quickly strangled Mr. Khashoggi and dismembered his body with a bone saw. “In the early days, President Trump said it would be solved. Ms. Pelosi said how unacceptable it was,” Ms. Cengiz, 37, an Istanbul-based graduate student, said through a translator. “Seven or eight months later, we see that nothing has been done.” Ms. Cengiz’s testimony before a House Foreign Affairs Committee subcommittee was part of a broader hearing to explore the dangers of reporting on human rights. It underscored the continuing outrage of lawmakers, not only at the killing but also at the White House’s unflagging support of Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Speaking sometimes breathlessly and with tightly clasped hands, Ms. Cengiz testified that she had nightmares every night “thinking of Jamal’s suffering,” and she chronicled how their dream of building a life together was cut short. “This was my destiny,” she said, “to stand beside him in his life and his work, and for him to stand behind me in mine.” “If Jamal’s murder passes with impunity, then me speaking here today puts me in danger,” Ms. Cengiz said. “It places everyone who shares these universal values in danger.” Mr. Khashoggi’s killing unleashed a bipartisan furor on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers calling for action. “I fully realize we have to deal with bad actors and imperfect situations on the international stage,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a longtime proponent of the United States’ alliance with the kingdom. “However, when we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset.” But the White House remained cool to the killing. While the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis accused of being involved, President Trump issued an equivocal statement about Mr. Khashoggi’s death, ignoring the C.I.A.’s conclusion that the crown prince was directly responsible. “We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,” the president said in an extraordinary official statement in November. “In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” Lawmakers were further enraged when the White House defied a legal deadline to provide Congress with a report determining whether the crown prince was personally responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s death. In a rare invocation of the War Powers Act, Congress passed a bipartisan resolution that would have forced an end to American military involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, sending Mr. Trump a pointed rebuke over his continued defense of the kingdom. But the president vetoed the resolution in April, and supporters could not muster the votes to override it. This year, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, introduced legislation that would impose sanctions on those responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s death and prohibit some arms sales to Saudi Arabia. That legislation has yet to be taken up by the committee’s chairman, Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, a Trump loyalist. At Thursday’s hearing, however, lawmakers again vowed to hold the kingdom accountable. “There is a time now to draw a bright line in the sand,” said Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, upbraiding the kingdom’s “arrogance” as Ms. Cengiz nodded in agreement. Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Thursday that until those responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s death are brought to justice, “journalists around the world, particularly those covering human rights, will continue to work in an environment of uncertainty and vulnerability.” But he cautioned that Mr. Khashoggi’s death was part of a larger trend of threats facing reporters around the world, with at least 54 journalists killed last year — an 88 percent jump from 2017. “Murder,” Mr. Simon said, “is the ultimate form of censorship.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Old Town Road’: See How Memes and Controversy Took Lil Nas X to No. 1,"Lil Nas X was an unknown, unemployed 19-year-old college dropout when he bought a slightly twangy rap beat from a Dutch stranger on the internet. “Old Town Road,” the one-minute and 53-second song that he uploaded to SoundCloud and YouTube not long after, has since become an almost unprecedented cultural phenomenon, bringing together a cross-section of unlikely characters including Nine Inch Nails (whose instrumental track was sampled for the beat), Billy Ray Cyrus (who recorded a chart-topping remix) and the Texas Tech college basketball team (who wouldn’t stop dancing to it). Along its path to ubiquity, “Old Town Road” also earned Lil Nas X a major deal with Columbia Records and sparked a controversy over race and the sanctity of country music when the song was removed from the genre’s Billboard chart. Nashville bona fides aside — Lil Nas X calls the track a hybrid: “country-trap” — in July, it became the longest-running No. 1 single in the 61-year history of Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. Though the song came out of nowhere, it wasn’t quite a fluke. Lil Nas X, now 20, had been a student of online virality and a prolific amateur meme-maker, skills he put to use while marketing the song himself in its early stages. With a combination of imagery from the popular video game “Red Dead Redemption 2” and the wave of buzz around the black cowboy aesthetic known as the “yeehaw agenda,” “Old Town Road” became the soundtrack to a dance challenge on the social network TikTok and countless Instagram clips, priming it for a mainstream breakthrough. In the latest “Diary of a Song” episode, Lil Nas X is joined by the producer YoungKio — who didn’t even know he was a part of “Old Town Road” until he heard it in a video meme — and Billy Ray Cyrus, who lent the song another layer of novelty and outlaw credibility. The video also features cameos by the influencers @nicemichael and @elitelife_kd, who were crucial to the track’s early rise. Alexandra Eaton contributed reporting. “Diary of a Song” provides an up-close, behind-the-scenes look at how pop music is made today, using archival material — voice memos, demo versions, text messages, emails, interviews and more — to tell the story behind the track.

2019,‘On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous’ Captures a Young Immigrant’s Troubles and Ecstasies,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Ocean Vuong is a young Vietnamese-American writer — born in Saigon, he was raised in Hartford, Conn. — who made his debut in 2016 with “Night Sky With Exit Wounds,” a strong and much-praised book of poems. Vuong returns now with his second book and first novel, “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous.” (It’s the kind of title about which Dorothy Parker might have commented, “Speak for yourself.”) Like his first book, this one is semi-autobiographical and speaks solemnly to his experiences as an immigrant and a gay man. The narrator of “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous” is known to nearly everyone as Little Dog. He’s a writer in his late 20s, but this story is told largely in retrospect. We learn about his troubled family and youth, and about some occasional ecstasies, sexual and otherwise. Little Dog’s abusive father is absent. His mother works at a nail salon, smokes Marlboro Reds and has PTSD from the napalm and mortars that fell in Vietnam when she was a child. Her English is poor. She hits Little Dog too often, once smiting him with a box of Legos. This novel takes the form of a letter to her. Lan, Little Dog’s elderly grandmother, also lives in Hartford. She has schizophrenia and is dying of cancer. Back home, during the Vietnam War, she worked as a prostitute, a bar girl, and was deemed a traitor for her dalliances with the enemy. [Read our profile of Ocean Vuong.] Little Dog’s ostensible grandfather, a former American Navy man named Paul, met Lan in Saigon. Paul and Lan are now estranged. Thanks to Agent Orange, he has cancer as well. This is not Wallace Stevens’s decorous, button-down Hartford. Vuong pins the details of these marginalized immigrant lives, the food stamps and Goodwill stores and Thomas Kinkade images and expensive nighttime E.S.L. classes and trips to the corner store for “cigarettes and Hot Cheetos.” Vuong is a mightily gifted observer. Gunshots in downtown Hartford sound “like Little League home runs cracked one after another out of the night’s park.” After a day of work in nearby tobacco fields, Little Dog’s hands are “so thick and black with sap, dirt, pebbles and splinters, they resembled the bottom of a pan of burned rice.” Some lines have the almost hallucinatory exactness of his best poems: “The black wren this morning on my windowsill: a charred pear.” He can also dispatch Lenny Bruce-like wisecracks: “The one good thing about national anthems is that we’re already on our feet, and therefore ready to run.” Vuong’s writing about nail salons, and the way mothers raised their children in them, is moving and rarely less than excellent. “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous” is, at the same time, filled with showy, affected writing, with forced catharses and swollen quasi-profundities. There are enough of these that this novel’s keel can lodge in the mud. “A page, turning, is a wing lifted with no twin, and therefore no flight. And yet we are moved.” “There’s Mozzicato’s on Franklin, where I had my first cannoli. Where nothing I knew ever died.” “The rain keeps on because nourishment, too, is a force.” “They say everything happens for a reason — but I can’t tell you why the dead always outnumber the living.” “You once told me that the human eye is god’s loneliest creation.” “Do you ever wonder if sadness and happiness can be combined, to make a deep purple feeling, not good, not bad, but remarkable simply because you didn’t have to live on one side or the other?” “Deep Purple Feeling” could be an alternative title for certain swaths of this novel. Each of these lines, and this is only a small selection, is a pebble in the reader’s shoe. The strongest parts of “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous,” where this novel picks up genuine force and has some of the mournful resonance of the Bruce Springsteen song “The River,” arrive in its second half. This is where the narrator details his doomed love affair with Trevor, a boy he meets while both work in the tobacco fields. Trevor is, in Little Dog’s words, a “redneck” — a slightly older kid who wears a John Deere cap, drives a pickup truck and shoots and skins raccoons. Trevor makes Little Dog, one of society’s invisibles, feel seen. Looking back at Trevor, he thinks: “I studied him like a new word.” The writing comes in a rush, bliss on the topic of bliss: “I wanted more, the scent, the atmosphere of him, the taste of French fries and peanut butter underneath the salve of his tongue, the salt around his neck from the two-hour drives to nowhere and a Burger King at the edge of the county, a day of tense talk with his old man, the rust from the electric razor he shared with that old man, how I would always find it on his sink in its sad plastic case, the tobacco, weed and cocaine on his fingers mixed with motor oil, all of it accumulating into the afterscent of wood smoke caught and soaked in his hair.” Speaking of pleasures: About Trevor’s old man, we read: “He looked like Elvis on his last day alive.” This novel contains some pungent lines in which the narrator, fully grown and a successful writer, seems to push back against those who would admire or blurb his work. “They will want you to succeed, but never more than them. They will write their names on your leash and call you necessary, call you urgent.” Vuong’s novel is a mixed success, a book of highs and lows. At its best, it’s unleashed in every regard.",The New York Times
2019,‘One of the Rarest Things in Baseball’: Noah Syndergaard Does It All,"Mets 1, Reds 0 Noah Syndergaard believed he had already reached rock bottom. The imposing Mets pitcher’s E.R.A. was a bloated 6.35 after the season’s first month, and his record was 1-3. He no longer trusted his breaking pitches, and when he stood on the mound, he could not grip the baseball. The ball, he said, felt “slick as can be.” “Like holding an ice cube,” he said. But on Thursday at Citi Field, Syndergaard caught fire with a historic all-around performance. In a matinee outing, he offered the 21,445 fans in attendance a one-man show that lasted just over two hours and put him in rarefied territory for major league pitchers. In addition to striking out 10 batters in a complete-game shutout, Syndergaard rerouted a fastball 407 feet to left field for a solo home run in a 1-0 win over the Cincinnati Reds. It was only the seventh time in major league history that a pitcher homered and threw a 1-0 shutout, and the first time it had been done by a Met. The last pitcher to accomplish the feat was Bob Welch of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1983. “One of the rarest things in baseball,” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said after the game. For his final act, with the tying run at second and the go-ahead run at the plate, Syndergaard struck out Reds right fielder Yasiel Puig with a fastball that registered 99.5 miles per hour on the radar gun. Puig did not swing. “He said enough is enough,” Callaway said of Syndergaard. “He knows that he had to be better than what he was.” After Thursday’s victory, a Mets team that had seesawed its way through the first month to a 16-15 record felt like it was finally warming up. As the Mets departed for a trip that will take them to Milwaukee and then to San Diego, they were buoyed by strong back-to-back starts from Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom, the team’s ace. “We’re not satisfied at all with where we are at,” Callaway said. “We’ve got to feed off of what we’ve been doing as a pitching staff the last five days and get things rolling.” For Syndergaard, who shaved his beard and wore his long hair down for the first time this season, the turn of the calendar from April to May doubled as a clean slate. He welcomed the game’s noon start and the 66-degree temperature beneath a bright sun at first pitch. “It was a beautiful day,” said Syndergaard, who allowed four hits. “Summer’s starting to come around, or spring.” Either way, Syndergaard looked to be a man for all seasons. While he has struggled on the mound, he continued to hit the ball hard. With one homer to his name already this season, Syndergaard led off the bottom of the third inning in the left-handed batter’s box. Reds starter Tyler Mahle, a righty, threw a 92-m.p.h. fastball, and Syndergaard drove it to the opposite field. It was the sixth home run of Syndergaard’s career — putting him one short of Dwight Gooden’s franchise record for a pitcher of seven — and it was the Mets’ first run in 12 innings against Cincinnati and the Mets pitching staff’s fourth homer this year. “You just don’t see it very often,” Callaway said. “Unless our pitchers are hitting.” Syndergaard’s power display allowed the Mets’ beleaguered bullpen to rest, as well. In the Mets’ win on Tuesday, reliever Jeurys Familia blew a 3-1 lead when he was asked to record a six-out save and then reported that his shoulder was sore the next morning. The team put him on the injured list after giving him a cortisone injection, but General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen maintained that he had “no real long-term concern.” Closer Edwin Diaz came up short the next night. Although deGrom and reliever Seth Lugo combined for eight scoreless innings, Diaz entered the game in the ninth, recorded two outs and then gave up the game’s only run, a homer by Jose Iglesias. With Diaz and Familia unavailable, Callaway was counting on Syndergaard to chew up innings. “The lack of relief was a relief today,” Callaway said. “We don’t know how we get through the rest of the game if he doesn’t complete it.” The crowd gave its roar of approval for Syndergaard’s efforts both when he batted for himself in the bottom of the eighth and when he returned to the mound for the ninth. He collected two strikes on Reds left fielder Jesse Winker before Winker took exception to a called strike and began arguing with the home-plate umpire Marty Foster. Reds Manager David Bell sprinted from the dugout to intercede between Winker and Foster, but both Bell and Winker were ejected. Syndergaard finished off the pinch-hitter Kyle Farmer on a called third strike before getting Eugenio Suarez to fly out. The Reds managed to push Syndergaard past the 100-pitch mark in the ninth inning: With two out, first baseman Derek Dietrich singled to right field, and pinch-runner Michael Lorenzen came on to steal second before Syndergaard struck out Puig on three pitches — bringing his total for the afternoon to 104, 74 of which were strikes. “It feels like a huge weight has been taken off my shoulder,” Syndergaard said. Afterward, Syndergaard could not pinpoint one correction that had allowed him to pitch better. He did vow never to grow a beard again as he pulled on his black suede boots and fixed the straps. Across the clubhouse, Pete Alonso, who had just learned that he had won rookie of the month honors for the National League, looked over at the veteran. “He was a one-man wrecking crew out there today,” he said. “Really awesome outing for him. He absolutely demolished that ball out there.”",The New York Times
2019,‘POMS’ Review: Shake It Till You Make It,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The combined ages of the cheerleaders in “POMS” is well over 500 years, but the movie’s jokes feel even older. An uncomfortable blend of sickness and silliness, this dancing-past-the-graveyard comedy suggests that the many travails of aging can be endured if you only gather enough friends and surrender enough dignity. It might be right; yet there must be better ways to prove it than throwing together some fine actors, then humiliating the heck out of them. By all means, have the terminally ill Martha (Diane Keaton) and her retirement-community pals form an unlikely cheerleading squad. (There’s a real one in Sun City, Ariz., and it’s even called Poms.) But do they have to perform, cringingly under-rehearsed, at a crowing high-school pep rally? And do they need a climactic finale — complete with one member in a bedazzled wheelchair — featuring moves that make the Funky Chicken look refined? Apparently, they do, as “POMS” is uninterested in the credibility or depth that could have made the story worthwhile. Martha has come to Sun Springs to die, yet we learn nothing about her that might contextualize her rejection of medical treatment. Jacki Weaver’s natural earthiness is shallowly repurposed as Sheryl, a randy-oldster cliché (“My only talents are poker and poking”), while veteran performers like Pam Grier and Rhea Perlman gyrate in the background, their characters little more than outlines with creaky joints. Within these lazy sketches, though, genuinely compelling sub-strands — controlling husbands; infantilizing adult children — lie frustratingly fallow. More than anything, this egregiously stale movie needs a talented comedy writer, yet the British documentary filmmaker Zara Hayes directs as if Shane Atkinson’s screenplay cracks her up. Whether it will do the same for audiences remains to be seen. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,Cannes 2019 Winners: South Korean Movie ‘Parasite’ Wins the Palme d’Or,"The Palme d’Or, the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, was awarded Saturday to “Parasite,” a ferocious satire and critical favorite from the South Korean director Bong Joon-ho. “I never imagined this,” Mr. Bong said, accepting the award. This is the first time that a South Korean movie has won the Palme d’Or. Sylvester Stallone, who was honored at the festival, presented the Grand Prix, or second prize, to the French-Senegalese filmmaker Mati Diop for her feature debut “Atlantics.” Ms. Diop is the first black woman to have a movie in the main competition. The streamlined awards ceremony was quick and almost painless. The main competition jury was led by the Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who said from the stage that while “democracy is disappearing” the jury was still very democratic. Its prizes included a “special mention” for “It Must Be Heaven,” an existential comedy from the Palestinian director Elia Suleiman. The French director Céline Sciamma won the best screenplay prize for “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” Another critical favorite, this love story set in the 18th century centers on a female painter and her subject, a young woman whose portrait she is painting. The best actress was presented to Emily Beecham, the star of “Little Joe,” a mordant, amusing movie from the Austrian director Jessica Hausner. The best actor was won by Antonio Banderas, the star of Pedro Almodóvar’s widely-loved “Pain and Glory.” “This is my night of glory,” Banderas said, as the audience burst into applause. One of the biggest surprises was best director, which was given to the Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne for “Young Ahmed.” Press members in the theater opposite of the one in which the awards took place erupted in vigorous boos at the announcement. The Dardennes have won the Palme d’Or twice and their influence on contemporary cinema is profound, as was evident throughout the festival. But their new movie was seen by many critics as a disappointment. The documentary filmmaker Michael Moore presented the Jury Prize (third prize), though only after taking a swipe at President Trump: “Trump is the lie that enables more lying,” he said. This award was shared by two radically different movies about marginalized communities under siege: the French genre movie “Les Misérables” from Ladj Ly, and the Brazilian movie “Bacurau,” from Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles. “We are ambassadors of culture in Brazil,” Mr. Mendonça said, and “we need support and respect.” The most hotly anticipated film in the festival, Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,” left without any prizes. Saturday’s ceremony capped what was widely seen as one of the strongest festivals in years, and which found Mr. Tarantino, Mr. Almodóvar and Terrence Malick receiving some of their best reviews in a long time.",The New York Times
2019,‘Pasolini’ Review: One Rebellious Filmmaker’s Tribute to Another,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In the autumn of 1975, at the Rome apartment he shares with his mother and a cousin, Pier Paolo Pasolini is giving what will turn out to be his last interview. A week after his body is found on a beach outside the city, the conversation will be published in La Stampa under the headline “We Are All in Danger.” Parts of it are reproduced verbatim (in English), in Abel Ferrara’s new film. During the interview, Pasolini, played with melancholy poise by Willem Dafoe, is in a pessimistic, ruminative mood, contemplating a society so mired in corruption, violence and dishonesty that the only hope for the future may lie in its destruction. He also reflects on his own activity as a poet, essayist, filmmaker and novelist. “How do you define yourself?” he is asked. “As a writer,” Pasolini replies with a shrug. His Olivetti typewriter serves as a talisman in this movie (first shown at the Venice Film Festival in 2014), which is more of an essay than a biopic. Pasolini, who was born in 1922, led an eventful and complicated life — Barth David Schwartz’s English-language biography runs to nearly 800 pages — and died a senseless and sensationally violent death at 53. “Pasolini” takes place mainly in the days leading up to his murder, but, if anything, Ferrara, a notorious provocateur in his own right, tries to dispel some of the feverish speculation and conspiracy-mongering that has surrounded that crime. His reverence for his subject as a fellow artist and kindred rebel spirit is evident in every frame, but he also works to strip away the layers of martyrdom and mythmaking that obscure the man and his art. Somewhat surprisingly, given the penchant for extremity that Ferrara and Pasolini share, what emerges is mostly a sober portrait of the writer at work, with especially imaginative attention to the work itself. Dafoe, handsome and hollow-cheeked, not only bears a notable physical resemblance to his character, but he also seems almost mystically in touch with the man’s mind and sensibility. He accomplished a similar alchemy with Vincent van Gogh in Julian Schnabel’s “At Eternity’s Gate,” which channeled the ecstasy and torment of the painter’s inner life. Pasolini’s temperament is quieter — for all his eloquence, his deepest gifts are for listening and observation — and more finely grained with contradiction. In a late poem, he declares his “endless capacity for obedience” and his “endless capacity for rebellion,” and Ferrara organizes his film around that contrast, exploring how conservative and radical impulses can coexist within a single personality. We see Pasolini doing postproduction on his last completed movie, “Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom,” a scandal then and now for its graphic displays of sexual cruelty. He is quiet and disciplined; the images he makes are violent and chaotic. At home during the day, he obeys the routines of a settled bourgeois man of letters. His cousin, Graziella (Giada Colagrande), brings him coffee while he reads the morning papers. He goes over corrections on manuscripts, takes phone calls, sits down to lunch with his mother, Susanna (Adriana Asti), and some visiting friends. At night, he drives his Alfa Romeo through Rome’s poor neighborhoods, looking for sex and companionship among the young men who loiter on street corners and in bars. One of them, the 17-year-old Pino Pelosi, would confess to beating Pasolini and running him over with the Alfa, a confession he later recanted. Over the years, rival accounts of the crime have proliferated, involving the right, the left, the mafia and other forces that might have wanted to rid Italy of one of its most prominent and uncompromising social critics. Several movies have already been made about the killing, including Marco Tullio Giordana’s briskly forensic “Who Killed Pasolini?” Ferrara treats the murder matter-of-factly, as a tragic act of homophobic violence that is neither inevitable nor the summation of the victim’s life. “Pasolini” is a reminder of that life and some of its meanings, rather than an attempt to render its fullness. When asked if he thinks sex is political, Dafoe’s Pasolini answers that “everything is political.” But the film isn’t really, at least not in the sense of engaging the ideological battles that commanded so much of his energy and attention. A maverick Marxist and a heterodox Catholic, Pasolini was a scourge of the long-governing Christian Democratic Party and an irritant to the Communists as well. He was hugely popular and widely hated. After his funeral, 10,000 people gathered in Rome’s Campo de’ Fiori to mourn. None of that figures in Ferrara’s movie, an omission that has the effect — and, I think, the intention — of liberating Pasolini from his time. As exquisitely detailed and historically accurate as many of its scenes are, “Pasolini” is less concerned with the realistic reconstruction of the past than with communicating a mood in the present. The actors speak various languages in sometimes awkward accents. Important characters arrive without introduction. Not much is explained. That’s what Wikipedia is for. The most audacious and rewarding sequences take leave of biography altogether and imagine moments from projects — a novel and a film — that Pasolini left unfinished or barely started. The blend of pornography and humor, obnoxiousness and elegance, sweetness and cruelty reminds you that this is, above all, an Abel Ferrara movie. And the splendor of “Pasolini” lies in its essentially collaborative nature. The mischievous visionary responsible for “King of New York,” “Bad Lieutenant” and “The Addiction” didn’t just make a movie about the polymath responsible for “Accattone,” “Teorema” and “The Gospel According to Saint Matthew.” They made it together.

2019,‘Perfect’ Review: Beyond Skin Deep,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Ambition strains ability in Eddie Alcazar’s “Perfect,” a woozily incoherent sci-fi nightmare that appears destined to entertain mainly the thoroughly stoned — or make you feel as if you are. A Cronenbergian look at genetic engineering and body modification, the movie introduces Vessel 13 (Garrett Wareing), an impossibly beautiful young man who has woken up next to the bloodied corpse of his girlfriend. “Am I bad?,” he asks Mother (Abbie Cornish), who promptly packs him off to a secluded woodland clinic decorated with dazed, android-esque beauties swimming and lounging and downward dog-ing. Are they drugged-out models? Brainwashed members of a plastic-surgery cult? Perhaps both, as they drift through this chilly, unsettling space while disembodied voices intone enigmatic affirmations (“The way out is really the way in”) and directions for personal transformation. These require the young man to slice into himself and remove gory cubes of flesh, then — echoes of “Videodrome” — replace them with apparent reprogramming modules. Hoping to ease the torture of his sick dreams and visions, he willingly complies. Sticking with “Perfect” means trusting that, eventually, its many weird and gruesome sights will be revealed as meaningful. As its troubled hero regresses to a subhuman state — a Caliban on an island of flawless zombies — Matthias Koenigswieser’s sometimes astounding visuals feel increasingly frenzied and psychedelic. Washing the screen in carmine and ink, he paints a brittle, self-consciously arty veneer that, matched with Flying Lotus’s dreamily insistent score, creates disorienting sensory overload. The upshot is an oppressive, inscrutable puzzle that made me more curious about the inside of Alcazar’s head than that of his tortured subject — the kind of movie that, in some circles, might inspire fetishistic rewatching.

2019,‘Photograph’ Review: A Rom-Com Walks the Streets of Mumbai,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A man and woman from different walks of life share a brief, awkward encounter. They meet again sometime later, thanks in part to happenstance (and also, the man’s persistence). For reasons both cultural and narratively convenient, the two pretend to be a couple in order to appease his overbearing grandmother. Of course, the deceptive act gives way to genuine affection. If such plotting sounds like a tale (or several) you’ve heard before, it’s because in his sentimental drama “Photograph,” the writer and director Ritesh Batra intends for it to — as one character matter-of-factly states to another, “movies are all the same.” That’s probably an overstatement, but there is enough here to discover amid the obvious. Rafi (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is a street photographer, struggling to pay off a family debt. He sets up shop in front of the tourist-packed Gateway of India in Mumbai, where he meets Miloni (Sanya Malhotra), a younger woman who lives comfortably with her parents while studying to become an accountant. Neither are very happy before they meet. All any of Rafi’s friends and family can talk about is the fact that he’s unmarried, with no children — word has reached him that his grandmother, or dadi in Hindi, has supposedly stopped taking her medication in protest. Rafi, worn down, sends her a photo of Miloni with a letter falsely identifying her as his love interest. The shy and quiet Miloni is uninterested in her parents’ plan for her to get a good job and a husband, dreaming of leaving the city for a quiet life in a village. When she agrees to pose as Rafi’s love interest for his dadi (Farrukh Jaffar), who is eager to visit Mumbai to meet Miloni, it’s a welcome break from the monotony of her own life. If the story is familiar, the storytelling can be immersive — Batra shades in the leads and their worlds with a human specificity that makes “Photograph” compelling in a slice-of-life way, particularly regarding class in India. A cabdriver becomes testy with Rafi and is quick to pronounce that he has a degree in English despite his current professional status. Miloni shares a close bond with her family’s live-in housekeeper, and their conversations before bedtime succinctly reveal another way in which hierarchy casually plays out in the everyday. And Rafi and Miloni’s relationship isn’t just improbable to their family and friends because of the difference in their means, but because of, in part, India’s deeply ingrained color-caste system: Several characters make disparaging comments about Rafi’s darker skin, compared with Miloni’s fair complexion. (His grandmother laments that her grandson works in the sun all day, and is now a “black raisin.”) Such societal details aren’t hammered in; they’re embedded as seamlessly as they tend to be in real life. As in Batra’s feature debut, “The Lunchbox,” which also saw an unlikely pair fall for each other under rom-com-like circumstances, the desire for human connection is never far from mind. Sometimes, as it does here, the search for that connection makes the journey a pleasure, no matter how conventional.

2019,‘Pokémon Detective Pikachu’ Review: A Cat and (Electric) Mouse Game,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Pokémon Detective Pikachu” is the first feature to pivot on a pairing of animated characters from the Japanese merchandising juggernaut and real live actors. But why even bother? The human stars barely look like they have pulses. The plotting proceeds with the one-mission-then-the-next logic of a video game, and even the notion of film noir feels bogus. When we see a clip from a gangster picture on screen, it’s the fake movie from “Home Alone.” A video game is, in fact, what “Detective Pikachu,” directed by Rob Letterman, is based on, but its sense of cinematic history extends at least to the long-long-ago of 1988 and “Who Framed Roger Rabbit,” to which it owes what might be called a debt. Tim (Justice Smith) has a deep-seated dislike for Pokémon creatures, just as Bob Hoskins’s private eye did for ’toons in “Roger Rabbit.” That aversion is tested when he teams up with Pikachu (voiced by Ryan Reynolds), his father’s detecting partner, after the father appears to have been killed in an accident. (Pikachu became a gumshoe for Nintendo, but the character, as seen in other Pokémon adventures, is the cute little critter with rosy cheeks who causes storms of electricity.) [When Pokemon go 3-D.] Detective Pikachu has amnesia, though. As if inviting the viewer to pick up a controller, he laments aloud that he can’t solve his own mystery. He can, however, talk to Tim — everyone else simply hears “pika, pika” — in dialogue that sounds like Raymond Chandler filtered through the children’s game of telephone. Their stomping ground, Ryme City, incorporates elements of London, Tokyo and New York but makes them all look like their theme-park equivalents. The town is half paradise and half dystopia: Humans and Pokémon live side by side, even while gamblers egg on vicious Pokémon battles in the city’s underworld and an unpaid journalism intern (Kathryn Newton), sick of listicles, snoops around for a story. (O.K., maybe that last part feels real.) The narrative seems designed to be followed by even those with the shortest attention spans; plot points get repeated in case you’ve decided to look down to send a text message. (“That must have been how Mewtwo escaped,” Tim says of the movie’s menacing catlike villain — right after a hologram has shown us that very escape.) “Pokémon Detective Pikachu” has been shot on film, a nostalgic touch that’s now unusual for a movie that combines live action and cartoons. But the imagery lacks weight and texture. (Anyone who dismissed the technical mastery Steven Spielberg brought to “Ready Player One,” a similar combination of real and virtual worlds, ought to feel pretty sorry now.)

2019,‘Q Ball’ Review: Shooting Hoops While Doing Time,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In San Quentin State Prison, just north of San Francisco, the basketball team offers inmates both purpose and distraction, a chance to win in lives not characterized by victories. Those benefits, and many others, are the main focus of Michael Tolajian’s capable documentary “Q Ball,” which observes team members on and off the court, at worship services and in boisterous weekly matchups with visiting civilian teams. Supported by the Golden State Warriors N.B.A. franchise (whose representatives arrive annually for a highly anticipated game), the players’ expertise is impressive. Interviews reveal personal struggles and criminal pasts, but most of the screen time is devoted to two personalities: the thoughtful head coach, Rafael Cuevas, whose nontraditional methods are not universally supported, and the team’s star player, Harry Smith, a onetime N.B.A. prospect who still harbors hopes of a professional career. Despite small digressions outside the prison walls (including one to speak with a murder victim’s mother), “Q Ball” feels superficial, its positivity somewhat forced. Emphasizing the rehabilitative rewards of the program — though its effect on recidivism, if any, is not quantified — the movie offers minimal access to nonplayers or prison staff beyond the soft-voiced cheerleading of the public information officer, Lt. Samuel Robinson. Issues pertinent to mass incarceration are skirted (the majority of faces on screen, for instance, are nonwhite), the players’ relationships with other inmates unclear. A violent dustup off the court, which the movie shows twice but doesn’t address, could make you wonder if the team’s privileges breed envy as well as pride. As a sales pitch for an undeniably popular program, “Q Ball” (filmed in 2018) builds a crescendo of hope and good will. Anyone seeking a more substantive conversation on life beyond the basket, however, will have to look elsewhere.

2019,Opinion | ‘Queer People of Faith’,"letter A reader discusses an Op-Ed by an Episcopal priest that hailed Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s candidacy as a milestone. To the Editor: Re “Mayor Pete and the Queering of the American Soul,” by the Rev. Steven Paulikas (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, April 17): Mr. Paulikas was clearly moved to hear his Episcopal parishioners laud the “strength of character” they see in Mayor Pete Buttigieg. So few words have been spent to celebrate the spiritual virtues of queer people, and I agree, it is a balm to hear some. Yet I am troubled by Mr. Paulikas’s emphasis on “society’s widening affirmation,” which insidiously shifts the focus back to straight society. We must lift up the voices and stories of queer people of faith ourselves. We are here: Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish and beyond. For me the powerful part of Mayor Pete’s comments to Vice President Mike Pence was hearing him make a decisive statement in religious terms: “If you’ve got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my Creator.” Queer people think our own religious thoughts; we are not just the subjects of others’ judgment.

2019,"‘Rocketman’ Review: The Fantastical Tale of Elton John, Survivor, Rock God, Camp Icon","CRITIC’s PICK Taron Egerton brings understated flamboyance and flamboyant understatement to his portrayal of the former Reginald Dwight. The first album I ever bought with my own allowance was “Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy,” one of two studio LPs Elton John released in 1975. Nestled inside the sleeve was a graphic-novel-style booklet about the singer’s life, a source of great fascination to me at the time. I spent many hours that summer on the beanbag chair in the green-carpeted den, listening to “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” and poring over the tale of how a shy, bespectacled piano prodigy named Reginald Dwight blossomed into the internationally renowned song stylist dominating my turntable and millions of others. “Rocketman,” directed by Dexter Fletcher from a screenplay by Lee Hall, recounts a slightly updated, substantially more candid version of the same story. Back in the ’70s, the fact that John was gay counted as an official secret, as did the extent of his devotion to alcohol, cocaine and other substances. But like that booklet, the movie — a testament to self-realization and a chronicle of recovery — is very much an authorized life. John, now 72, married and many years sober, serves as an executive producer and the author (with his lyricist Bernie Taupin, of course) of most of the soundtrack. (The instrumental score, threaded with echoes and allusions to his hits, with special attention to “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” is by Matthew Margeson.) But the point of “Rocketman” isn’t self-aggrandizement. It’s fan service of an especially and characteristically generous kind. It’s certain that Elton John has nothing left to prove, but it’s also possible that he’s underappreciated. He has been part of the pop-music mainstream for so long — more than 50 years! — that the scope of his genius and the scale of his accomplishments risk being taken for granted. Nearly all the dozen or so songs you hear in this movie were originally recorded within the span of about seven years, and they represent the tip of a musical iceberg with few rivals. Still, I doubt I’m the only listener of my generation who has at times succumbed to the lure of rock-snob dogmatism and worshiped false idols of authenticity, as if Sir Elton’s splendid artifice were something to be outgrown or outsmarted. And I’m sure I’m not the only one who will be grateful to be reminded of how much I loved him, and why. As “Rocketman” tells it, that affection — mine and everyone else’s — stands in painful contrast to the absence of love in Reg Dwight’s childhood. (He’s played as a boy by Matthew Illesley and in adolescence by Kit Connor; the adult Elton is Taron Egerton). Dad (Steven Mackintosh) withholds all affection and approval from his firstborn son, in spite of a shared interest in music. Mum (Bryce Dallas Howard) runs hot and cold, her warmth always contingent on her own needs. After they split up, there’s a harmless, useless stepfather (Tom Bennett). Luckily, there is also a grandmother around — the wonderful Gemma Jones — to notice the lad’s talents and to make sure he cultivates them, with lessons at the Royal Academy of Music. It’s also lucky that Fletcher and Hall, rather than making a standard biopic, infuse this one with anti-literalist elements of jukebox-musical spectacle. Grown-up Elton sings duets with his younger self. Young Reg dances his way to adulthood to the sounds of “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting.” As a result, the chronology is almost as baroque as the melodies. Sometimes the songs are embedded in the plot, as when Elton, early in his partnership with Taupin (Jamie Bell), unfurls “Your Song,” apparently off the top of his head, on the piano in his mother’s parlor. Or, a bit later, when he takes the stage at the Troubadour in Los Angeles and levitates the crowd with “Crocodile Rock.” Other songs — “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” and the title track, among others — function more as musical numbers, giving theatrical vividness and metaphorical voice to Elton’s emotions. Those are heard when they suit the mood, rather than the historical record. The film shrewdly resists the biographical cliché of supposing that the songs originate in or refer to specific moments of feeling. That isn’t really how art works, especially an art as collaborative as Elton and Bernie’s. Their creative alliance is the film’s core, the quiet, non-dysfunctional love story woven through the glitter, excess and heartbreak. “Your Song” becomes the emblem of this relationship. Bernie writes it for Elton, who sings it for Bernie, and thanks to the flexible magic of the second-person pronoun, it becomes a message that each one is sending to the other, and then to everyone else in the world. It’s hard to think of a portrayal of artists at work less invested in the myth of creative struggle. Bernie produces lyrics by the bushel, Elton has tunes by the bucketful, and the resulting hits make both men insanely rich before either turns 30. The trouble, for Elton, is what follows from that success, as his fame exacerbates the unhealed wounds of childhood. The main plot of “Rocketman” follows a familiar therapeutic loop. We start in rehab, where Elton has arrived in full stage regalia, a bright orange jumpsuit adorned with angel wings and devil horns. (Most of the clothes Egerton is shown wearing are replicas of costumes Elton John actually wore, a feat of costume design by Julian Day that is ostentatious and humble at the same time.) We cycle through early striving and midcareer misery. Some of that is brought about by John Reid (Richard Madden), a sharp-dressed music-industry sharpie who notices Elton’s talent, appraises his sexual insecurity and finds a way to take advantage of both. His ruthlessness and Elton’s appetites combine to push the singer to the brink of self-destruction, a precondition for the redemption that follows. Egerton, with what can only be called flamboyant understatement — and also, I suppose, understated flamboyance — in effect plays both the Lady Gaga and the Bradley Cooper parts in a fresh iteration of “A Star Is Born.” His Elton is the hard-living road warrior and the preternaturally gifted ingénue, the sacrificial hero and the plucky survivor, the rock god and the camp icon. The actor delivers a tour de force of self-effacement, a bravura demonstration of borrowed charisma. Fletcher sometimes overreaches, with respect to both spectacle and storytelling — the choreography can be as confusing as the timeline — but when it’s working “Rocketman” has the earnest, extravagant energy of a Baz Luhrmann movie. That description is, in this context, very much a compliment, since Luhrmann-esque showmanship is just what you want in a movie about Elton John. The other thing you want is Elton John’s music, a desire that “Rocketman” by turns satisfies, sharpens and frustrates. The songs aren’t quite the way you remember them, and in most cases the new versions are put to effective dramatic use. But they don’t quite stand alone, and they’re unlikely to displace the originals on anyone’s streaming playlist. That’s just fine of course: The point is to spark renewed fondness for those old records, and for the incandescent meteor of a man who made them. Rocketman Rated R. Sex, drugs, you know the drill.

2019,"‘S.N.L.,’ Hosted by Paul Rudd, Takes On Trump and the Abortion Bans","A “Saturday Night Live” season finale is traditionally an occasion for the show to pull out all the stops, leave everything on the stage, tear it all down and figure out how to put it back together in the fall. In this weekend’s conclusion to “S.N.L.” Season 44 (which was hosted by Paul Rudd), the musical guest DJ Khaled certainly brought it, performing with a pantheon of surprise performers including Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Meek Mill, SZA and John Legend, while also paying tribute to the rapper Nipsey Hussle, who was fatally shot in March. And, well, Alec Baldwin and the “S.N.L.” cast tried their hand at a musical number of their own. The show’s opening sketch began with Baldwin (who has been a more infrequent presence this past season) as President Trump in the Oval Office. He explained that he was excited for the summer and said that the “American economy is on fire — I’m not going to tell you if it’s a fire that keeps you warm or burns your house to the ground, but it’s some kind of fire.” Baldwin added, “I’m on cruise control to a second term and there’s nothing the Democrats in Congress can do about it. So sit back and enjoy the ride, America, because tonight, well — ” This kicked off a music parody of Queen’s glam-rock classic “Don’t Stop Me Now” that also featured Beck Bennett as Vice President Mike Pence, Cecily Strong as Melania Trump and Aidy Bryant as Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Rather than try to sing it ourselves, we’ll just share some of the most memorable lyrics: Bryant: He’s a loose cannon ripping up the laws of society You can’t subpoena him, he’s gonna obstruct Strong: He’s a billionaire, unless you take a look at his tax returnsHe’s gonna hide, hide, hide Oh, there’s no showing you Baldwin: I’m burning every bridge, picking every fight Strong: That’s why they call him Mr. Bad Advice ‘Cause he listens to the Fox News guys There were further cameos from Chris Redd as Kanye West, Kenan Thompson as Justice Clarence Thomas, Kate McKinnon as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Mikey Day as Donald Trump Jr. and Alex Moffat as Eric Trump. (When he was told that he was allowed to sing as well, Moffat performed a verse of the “Muppet Show” theme song.) Revisiting his role as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Robert De Niro attempted to halt the performance, declaring that he had “something very important to say to the American people — something they need to hear.” But Baldwin simply talked over him — “No collusion, no obstruction,” he said — and resumed the number. At the conclusion of the sketch, Baldwin told the audience, “I don’t know what’s next for me, but I wouldn’t be Donald Trump if I didn’t say tune in next season to see who lives and who dies.” McKinnon added, “Spoiler: I live. I live for another 150 years. And the Iron Throne will be mine.” [Looking for TV and movie recommendations?

NelsonFrankie dated Ernie HudsonThey’re both like 80-somethingRiding hot air balloons like it’s nothingThink I’m bluffing let me tell you boyIt sure is something For a “Weekend Update” commentary on the numerous states that have recently passed sweeping prohibitions on abortion, Leslie Jones took to the stage wearing a costume from “The Handmaid’s Tale.” She said to Colin Jost, “My name is actually Ofjost. But I don’t know how good of a baby maker I’m going to be because my eggs is dusty as hell, but I’ll give it a shot.” Describing these abortion restrictions as “a war on woman,” Jones said, “This is how it starts. I’m out living my life. Then I see on the news, a bunch of states are trying to ban abortion. And they tell me what I can and can’t do with my body. Next thing you know, I’m in Starbucks and they won’t take my credit card because I’m a woman. Instead of the regular reason, which is, I don’t have no money on it.” Jones also offered her support to other women who may feel “scared or confused,” telling them, “You’re not alone.” “You can’t tell me what to do with my body,” Jones said. “You can’t make me small or put me in a box. I’m six feet tall and 233 pounds. Ain’t no box big enough to hold me. And I know, ‘cause one time I tried to mail myself to a dude.” Speaking from the “Weekend Update” desk, Cecily Strong reprised her role as Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News personality who was suspended by the network earlier this year for anti-Muslim remarks. After expressing her gratitude to “the brave sponsors who stuck with me despite the accusations by the radical loony left,” Strong took intermittent sips from a martini glass and emptied its contents on the “Weekend Update” anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che. When Jost asked her if she could speak more softly, Strong answered, “Oh, no can do, bud. Twenty years ago, I yelled at a waiter because my Cobb salad had a cranberry in it. And now I’m locked at this volume every day for the rest of my life.” You had to wait until late in the show to get to it, but this week “S.N.L.” did once again return to the comfortable terrain of “The View,” the ABC daytime talk show that Leslie Jones (playing co-host Whoopi Goldberg) described as “the most high-stakes brunch on television.” Aidy Bryant was back as Meghan McCain (“I’m getting attacked and as the person most upset right now, I am right,” she said), and Paul Rudd had his first crack at playing Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. “I may only be 37 years old, but I do feel like I represent everyday Americans,” Rudd said. “I’m just a Harvard-educated, multilingual war veteran Rhodes scholar. I’m just like you.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘S.N.L.’ Celebrates Mother’s Day With Emma Thompson, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler","It’s become something of a recent tradition at “Saturday Night Live” for the annual pre-Mother’s Day broadcast to feature a tribute of sorts from current cast members to their real-life moms. That custom was upheld in this weekend’s episode, hosted by Emma Thompson and featuring the Jonas Brothers as musical guests. But for her opening monologue, Thompson (who said her daughter, Gaia Wise, was in the audience) was joined by two other moms with long histories at “S.N.L.” — former cast members Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who offered “a little language lesson” to help children decode what their mothers might be saying to them. For example, Thompson said, “When you ask your mother what she wants to do for Mother’s Day and she says — ” Fey: “Just to relax in the backyard, maybe a massage.” Thompson: What she’s actually asking is — Poehler: “How does one buy weed?” Or, Thompson said, “When your mother sees what you’re wearing and says — ” Poehler: “Oh, I like that shirt.” Thompson: What she’s trying to say is — Fey: “Oh, I think I bought you that shirt.” In other examples, “You look tired” means “You look bad”; “Can we just not talk about politics?” means “Please don’t ruin Joe Biden for me — he’s what I picture”; and “Son, you know I love you just the way you are” means “I am bored of waiting for you to tell me you’re gay — just do it so I can buy rainbow stuff.” Fey and Poehler offered examples of regional mom-isms from Philadelphia and Boston, and Thompson said that, to a British mother, “splendid” translates as, “I’m sad. I’m happy. How are you? You embarrass me. I’m crazy. You’re drunk.” Thompson added, “‘Splendid’ is sort of our ‘aloha.’” The bipartisan, politics-free tone that buoyed last week’s Adam Sandler-hosted episode of “S.N.L.” lasted exactly zero seconds into this week, which began with a “Meet the Press” parody featuring Senators Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett), Susan Collins (Cecily Strong) and Lindsey Graham (Kate McKinnon) fielding questions from the moderator, Chuck Todd (Kyle Mooney), asking what it would take at this point for President Trump to lose their support. Posing a hypothetical example, Mooney said, “Robert Mueller testifies before Congress and says he believes Trump committed obstruction of justice.” McKinnon answered, “The best way to uphold the law is to be above it.” Another hypothetical from Mooney: “He said Trump colluded with the Russians.” Strong replied, “I’d have to write a strong worded email and send it straight to my drafts folder.” And what if the president were to adopt an even more rigid stance against abortion? Strong answered, “That’d be the most outrageous, ridiculous thing that I’d ever end up definitely voting for.” A scene from a fictional 1953 movie was really just an excuse for Thompson and McKinnon to chew up the scenery in the guises of two Golden Age movie stars who each had it written into their contracts that they had to receive the last word in all of their scenes. The absurd scenario led to comically awkward exchanges like this one: Thompson: “I’d better call my lawyer.” McKinnon: “And your lawyer better call his lawyer.” Thompson: “Too many lawyers, that makes lawyer soup.” McKinnon: “Lawyer, lawyer, pants on foyer.” A special shout-out to the enduring “Saturday Night Live” M.V.P. Kenan Thompson, who made the most of his role as an oblivious PBS host named Reese De’What. At the “Weekend Update” desk, anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che riffed on a recent investigation in The New York Times that showed the staggering financial losses of President Trump’s businesses in the 1980s and ’90s. Jost said, Well, guys, it turns out that Donald Trump may not be the financial genius that no one ever really thought he was. According to tax documents from 1985 to 1994, Trump appears to have lost “more money than any other American taxpayer.” And I love that during that period, when he was losing $1 billion, he had the audacity to write a book about how great he was at business. It’s like if right now if R. Kelly wrote a book on babysitting. But somehow there are still Trump supporters who are trying to spin this as a good thing. Look at this clip from “Fox & Friends.” [plays a clip of the “Fox & Friends” co-host Ainsley Earhardt saying, “It’s pretty impressive, all the things that he’s done in his life. It’s beyond what most of us could ever achieve.”] Come on, blonde lady, even you don’t believe that. You said the last part into your hand. It would be like if I said, “Oh, Donald Trump, he’s just such a [into hand] hardworking president.” Che: President Trump’s tax documents also showed that his airline — which I didn’t know anything about — launched in 1989 and lost $7 million a month, until it shut down in 1992. And just to give you an idea of how bad his airline was, it lasted 33 years less than Spirit. Speaking from the “Weekend Update” desk, Pete Davidson expressed gratitude to his mother, saying, “This year, she’s not just my mom. She’s also my roommate.” Davidson explained that he and his mother live together, adding, “I know what people think: They see you on TV and magazines and stuff and they think, ‘Wow. That guy must have his own place.’ Nope. But, it’s not like I moved into her house. I just bought a house with my mom. Like a winner.” Davidson said his 21-year-old sister, Casey, also lives with them, making for awkward situations. “I’ll see a strange dude in the house,” he said, “and I don’t know if he’s some dirt bag preying on my sister or the saint who’s going to take my mom off my hands.” Davidson then brought out his mother, Amy (who wore a pink sweatshirt with caricatures of herself and Pete). When Jost asked if they had plans for Mother’s Day, Davidson replied, “What do you mean? I put her on TV. This is it. You don’t know. Jon Hamm could be single and watching.” Amy Davidson said, “I’d also settle for James Spader.” Pete Davidson responded, “You’d settle for a Ninja Turtle. I just need a dad.” (Sorry, Ninja Turtles: After the show, it turned out, Amy Davidson got her first choice.) Like just about everyone with a Twitter account, “Saturday Night Live” sought to spin comedy from a recent “Game of Thrones” episode in which a modern-day coffee cup made an accidental appearance on the HBO fantasy series. The result on “S.N.L.” was a fictional Turner Classic Movies program called “Wait a Second, That Shouldn’t Be There!”, in which the host (Kyle Mooney) led us through other would-be anachronisms in TV shows and movies: a scene from the 2016 remake of “Roots” performed by Kenan Thompson (standing near a case of White Castle hamburgers) and Ego Nwodim (drinking a 7-Eleven Big Gulp); or a clip from “Shakespeare in Love” in which McKinnon disrobes to reveal a Tasmanian Devil “Thug Life” tattoo on her back.",The New York Times
2019,‘S.N.L.’ Welcomes Adam Sandler Back and (Mostly) Avoids Politics,"Was Opera Man there? Of course Opera Man was there. It was Adam Sandler’s first time hosting “Saturday Night Live” since he unceremoniously departed the show nearly a quarter-century ago, so naturally he brought back some of his best-loved characters from the mid-90s era when he shared the “S.N.L.” stage with David Spade, Mike Myers, Molly Shannon and others. Sandler also drew out some other celebrated “S.N.L.” alums to pop up throughout this weekend’s broadcast, which also featured the musical guest Shawn Mendes. But more crucially, Sandler’s presence seemed to inspire the current cast and creative team to dig deeply for material that matched their host’s stature and impish spirit — if nothing else, “S.N.L.” largely set aside its divisive political pantomimes in favor of more absurdist sketches, and ended on a surprisingly touching note. But first, Sandler had to account for how his “S.N.L.” tenure had ended in 1995. As he said in his monologue, he was 23 years old when he joined the show, his cast mates David Spade and Rob Schneider were 25 and “Norm Macdonald was maybe 60.” He said that he lost his virginity “to a woman in this very studio — I don’t kiss and tell but it was the Church Lady,” adding, “She said I was special.” Then, explaining his exit from the program, Sandler began to sing: I was fired, I was fired, I was fired, so sad to tellWell I never saw it comingI got fired from “S.N.L.” In another verse, he explained: I got fired, not rehiredWell it made me sad and blueI told my boy Chris Farley I got firedAnd he said, “Sandman, they fired my [expletive], too” Chris Rock, a friend of Sandler’s and former “S.N.L.” cast member, turned up to contribute a verse of his own. He sang: I got fired, I was fired, I was fired by NBC. Then I went on “In Living Color”Three weeks later, they took it off TV Pete Davidson, a current “S.N.L.” performer, also started to sing about being fired from the show, but Sandler told him he hadn’t been let go. “I wasn’t?” Davidson asked. “How is that even possible?” Sandler replied, “I don’t know, but be patient because it’s coming soon.” Then Sandler sang his closing verse: I was fired, I was firedNBC said that I was doneThen I made over $4 billion at the box officeSo I guess you could say I won As has often been the case this season, the opening sketch seemed at first to promise a comedic re-enactment of a recent political event. But no — as an exhausted narrator explained, Attorney General William P. Barr pulled out of a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee and then, the voice-over continued, “the Democrats chose to do some light prop comedy with a bucket of chicken. The whole thing was so depressing that we’d rather focus on the two things all Americans can get behind: ‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘Avengers.’” That set up a “Family Feud” parody featuring the “S.N.L.” cast as characters from “Game of Thrones” (including Kate McKinnon as Brienne of Tarth; Melissa Villaseñor as Arya Stark) and “Avengers: Endgame” (Beck Bennett as Thanos; Leslie Jones as a comically miscast Groot). But of course the best lines went to Kenan Thompson as the host Steve Harvey, who repeatedly mocked both teams and their media franchises: “Let’s start with the Avengers,” he said at the outset, “because this show is just like their movies. We’re going to open with 45 minutes of introductions.” Sandler turned in a memorably deadpan performance as Joe Romano, the proprietor of Romano Tours, a company offering vacations in Italy to customers who come from all over “but mostly Long Island and Jersey.” Yet as the commercial went on, Sandler made clear he was addressing a certain kind of clientele: “People love us,” he said, “but every so often a customer leaves a review that they were disappointed or didn’t have as much fun as they thought. So here at Romano Tours, we always remind our customers: If you’re sad now, you might still feel sad there, O.K.?” As he went on to painstakingly explain, with onscreen graphics and client testimonials, Sandler said, “Remember you’re still going to be you, on vacation. If you are sad where you are, and then you get on a plane to Italy, you, in Italy, will be the same sad you from before. Just in a new place. Does that make sense?” The celebrity family reunion sketch is a format that “S.N.L.” has used before, with hosts like Christopher Walken and Jim Carrey, but it seemed especially suited for Sandler, allowing the host to play straight man while the current cast served his characters and mannerisms back to him. That roster included Melissa Villaseñor paying homage to Sandler’s title character from “The Waterboy” and Pete Davidson as “Little Nicky,” as well as guest appearances from Jimmy Fallon and Kristen Wiig. Kate McKinnon reprised her recurring role as Elizabeth Warren, appearing at the “Weekend Update” desk to ask why her policy proposals aren’t getting more traction as the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination heats up. “I’m over here, working ’round the clock to give you free college,” McKinnon said. “But oh, look-ee there — Beto O’Dork did parkour in a Starbucks. Wow. Whoops, I just figured out universal pre-K but what’s that over there — Mayor Pete Bu-Judge Judy-Jute’s playing piano and speaking fluent Klingon.” Yes, Sandler did previously put on the wig and cape of Opera Man, his grandiose “Weekend Update” vocalist, for the “S.N.L.” 40th anniversary special that aired in 2015. But we’ll regard this segment as his true return to the character, when he finally got to croon about President Trump, “Game of Thrones” and the prospects for the 2020 election. As he sang to the tune of “La donna è mobile”: Kamala, GillibrandKlobuchar, Warren They have slim chance-oThey wear no pants-o Cory, Pete and BetoWill have to wait-oHere we go again70-year-old men With a tenderness and sincerity that he doesn’t often reveal in his comedy performances, Sandler closed out the show standing on the stage of Studio 8H with a guitar, singing a moving tribute to his “S.N.L.” co-star Chris Farley. Farley died from a drug overdose in 1997, at the age of 33, and a screen behind Sandler showed candid photos and videos of Farley from throughout his life, as well as some of his memorable “S.N.L.” performances, while the host sang about him in a balladeering, Springsteen mode: The first time I saw him he was sweeter than honeyPlaid jacket and belt too tight, and he wasn’t even being funnyThen he cartwheeled ’round the room and slow-danced with the cleaning ladyHe was a one-man partyYou know I’m talking about — I’m talking about my friend Chris Farley",The New York Times
2019,‘Safeword’ Review: The Bondage Play (Hold the Pleasure),"The plays of S. Asher Gelman try to fill the void in popular culture once occupied on TV by the likes of “Queer as Folk” and “The L Word” — shows that promised titillation about L.G.B.T. life but also educated audiences. In his first professional play, “Afterglow,” two men in an open marriage invite a young massage therapist into their bed and lives. The frank depiction of sex and the chiseled actors’ nudity turned the play into a sleeper hit. It ran Off Broadway for more than a year and even once hosted a nude audience night, during which patrons were invited to disrobe emotionally and physically. Mr. Gelman’s second play, “Safeword,” is hoping to do for bondage what “Afterglow” did for open marriage. But here, the characters are unfinished, and overall the play promises more than it can deliver. When the curtain rises at American Theater of Actors, we see Micah (Joe Chisholm) down on his knees as the muscular Xavier (Jimmy Brooks) stands behind him in full leather gear, holding a whip. “Tell me you like it,” Xavier says, as he strikes Micah’s back over and over. Not much is made of the fact that Micah is white and Xavier is black (all the characters have their race specified in the script) although that dynamic could’ve warranted a play all its own. (Thank you for “Slave Play,” Jeremy O. Harris!) Instead, we’re asked to focus on their progressive, colorblind existence. Micah is married to Lauren (Traci Elaine Lee) and the two own a restaurant. Though Lauren is just as creative a chef as Micah, she has quit so he can run the place by himself. She also has no idea about his secret life as a submissive. Xavier runs his pro dom business from an apartment next to his partner Chris’s place. Chris (Maybe Burke) is white, gender queer and doesn’t believe in marriage, although the couple has been together for seven years. Lauren and Micah live in the same building as Xavier and Chris. Convenient for dramatic purposes, but laughably improbable (the white, black and red set design is courtesy of Ann Beyersdorfer). In a city where finding the right coffee and barber takes endless trial and error, what are the chances of a sub finding a pro dom living above him? Mr. Gelman isn’t one for verisimilitude though. Lauren assumes the marks and burns on her husband’s back are the consequence of CrossFit. Instead, what interests Mr. Gelman is getting all his characters together to unleash forced drama. And once Lauren and Chris find out about Micah and Xavier, drama is what we get. Leaving “Safeword,” audiences should be quizzed. Can straight people be involved in bondage? Yes, we learn. Are all sub men gay? No, we find out. If you’re into bondage when do you need to respect your partner’s safeword? Always. Would it be too much to ask that we knew the characters as well as we know the rules of bondage? Mr. Gelman, who also directs, seems more concerned with disproving myths and setting up perfect tableaus (the scene transitions feel endless) than he does in creating characters we want to spend time with. We’re never privy to what makes these people tick; they’re all painted in broad, generic strokes, like the mock dating profiles you see on the subway. And we wouldn’t want to go home with any of them. This information was last updated on April 4, 2019",The New York Times
2019,‘Screen Time’ Is Over,"Mind The phrase can’t remotely capture our ever-shifting digital experience, social scientists say. Say hello to the “screenome.” The debate over screen time is typically accompanied by a good deal of finger-wagging: The digital experience is a ruinous habit, akin to binge-eating curly fries, gambling on cock fights or drinking whiskey with breakfast. Meanwhile, social scientists who are trying to study the actual psychological effects of screen time are left in a bind. For one thing, good luck finding a “control group” of people living the nondigital life or anything close to it. Children pick up devices early, and by their teens are spending six hours a day and more on screens — with phones, laptops and iPads, guzzling from the spigot of Netflix, Hulu and YouTube. Moreover, standard measures such as “average daily Facebook usage” are now practically meaningless. Consider what a person can do in just the time it takes to wait for a bus: text, watch a comedy skit, play a video game, buy concert tickets, take five selfies, each with a different set of cartoon ears. Learning how that behavior shapes an individual’s life experience requires an entirely new approach, one that recognizes that screen time is no mere habit but now a way of life. So argued a consortium of social and data scientists recently in the journal Human-Computer Interaction. The phrase “screen time,” they noted, is too broad to be scientifically helpful; it cannot remotely capture the fragmented, ever-shifting torrent of images that constitutes digital experience. “It’s very counterintuitive to say at this stage, but the fact is, no one really knows what the heck people are seeing on their screens,” said Byron Reeves, a professor of communications at Stanford and an author on the paper. “To understand what’s happening, we need to know what exactly that is.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Researchers have linked daily time spent on specific platforms, like Facebook, to measures of well-being and mental health. But to build a more compelling understanding of the effects of digital experience, they’ll need far more, the new paper argues. Scientists need to look over people’s shoulders, digitally speaking, and record everything, on every device, that an individual sees, does and types. The researchers call this ultra-fine-grained record a “screenome,” adapting the concept from “genome,” the full blueprint of one’s genetic inheritance. Each person’s daily screenome is similarly unique, a sequential, disjointed series of screens. “The point is, your thread is yours, mine is mine, and we use it to regulate our emotions, to balance facts with fun, in our own idiosyncratic way,” said Dr. Reeves, whose colleagues on the paper included researchers from Penn State University, Boston University, Apple Inc. and Toyota Research Institute. “We are not beholden to media companies to organize or direct what we do.” In arguing to develop such an approach, the researchers presented the digital threads of several dozen people, recorded with consent: screenshots taken every few minutes for periods ranging from a day to several days. Those records showed that people switched from one screen activity to another continually, every 20 seconds on average, and rarely spent more than 20 minutes uninterrupted on any one activity, even a full-length movie. One participant’s digital thread revealed when during the day her screen use was most- and least-concentrated, and where she was during those periods. Another subject’s record made clear why he stopped reading a news story about a couple being dragged off a United Airlines flight and switched to another site: in order to confirm his own reservations on United for an upcoming trip. [Your kids think you’re too addicted to your phone.] Perhaps most intriguing, the paper presented color-coded graphs of the digital threads of 30 college students, monitored over four days. The graphs revealed wide differences in what people used their screens for, as well as in their patterns of switching from one kind of activity, like email, to another, such as entertainment or news. Some people sprinkle brief periods of work between huge chunks of streaming movies and YouTube, for instance; others appear to be bouncing between email, work and news sites compulsively. These patterns can vary day to day, of course, for any of us. The deeper question for researchers, and one that they have not had an easy way to study, is how these shifting patterns shape daily experience. The most commonly cited downside of excessive screen time is low mood, or depression. In a recent study, researchers led by Johannes Eichstaedt of the University of Pennsylvania examined (with permission) the Facebook activity of 114 people diagnosed with depression. Using machine-learning algorithms, the team analyzed the content of the users’ posts from the months and years before receiving the diagnosis, and compared these to the posts of similar people who did not go on to develop depression. The analysis found differences in how frequently certain kinds of words appeared. For instance, people who later received a depression diagnosis talked about themselves on Facebook measurably more often than people who did not develop the mood problem. The analysis, while small by big-data standards, was the first to link to diagnoses in medical records, and it solidified previous correlations between online language content and low moods. “This is a well-documented process, that suffering generally contracts focus on the self, whereas mental well-being extends focus beyond the self,” Dr. Eichstaedt said. The researchers found that, by analyzing Facebook language in this way, they could predict whether a person was on their way to being diagnosed with depression about 70 percent of the time. “That’s about the rate you get with clinical questionnaires, and we haven’t been able to do better so far,” he said. Incorporating screenomes from even a sample of people who became depressed would put the Facebook data in a far richer context, and possibly clarify whether online experience indeed lowered people’s moods — and why. It might also reveal shared patterns of use in those who recovered from depression. The link between screen time and personality is another area of intense interest for researchers. In a 2015 study, Dar Meshi, a cognitive neuroscientist at Freie University in Berlin, led a group of researchers who described the brain circuits that support the impulse to share, and which are likely linked to levels of social media use. Here, too, gathering the full screenomes of at least some heavy users of social media might clarify how brain biology relates to screen use. “There are so, so many different variables that devices can record, not just content but speed of use, keyboard habits, frequency of switching sites,” said Dr. Meshi, who is now at Michigan State University. “We would be foolish to ignore these” as data sources. For now, screenome analysis may appeal primarily to people drawn to biotechnological self-discovery — those who send their saliva to DNA-testing companies or wear devices that track their footsteps and heart rate. But if the idea takes hold in social science, it could prompt a fundamental shift in the kinds of questions researchers pose. “How much screen time is too much” is a puzzle for a past era. Asking which patterns of screenome activity are problematic, and for whom, is the better inquiry for today.",The New York Times

What would happen if “Back to the Future” starred black people? That’s what the filmmaker Stefon Bristol imagines in “See You Yesterday” (there’s even a winking cameo by Michael J. Fox), now on Netflix, which centers on C. J. (Eden Duncan-Smith), a high school science prodigy who builds a time-traveling backpack. But instead of going back to the past to save her parents’ marriage, as Marty McFly did, she rewinds the previous 24 hours in hopes of preventing the murder of her brother by the police. As in “Back to the Future,” C.J. must be careful not to change a single aspect of the past lest she provoke a different but equally fateful event. For C.J., though, doom seems unavoidable either way, turning what could have been a fun time-travel tale into an ominous, sorrowful story that underscores the expendability of black lives. That’s a necessary message, reminding audiences that even in a world in which time travel is possible, the stakes are graver for black characters than for their white peers. In that sense, “See You Yesterday,” which was produced by Spike Lee, robs audience members — particularly young ones — of any sense of joy in fantasy and of the chance to celebrate a rare black female time traveler. But maybe that’s the point. Black kids often don’t have the luxury of living in a reverie. At its core, “See You Yesterday” is a story about grief and the inevitable question so many mourners have asked themselves: Could I have done anything to forestall my loved one’s death? Although the film doesn’t sugarcoat the horrors of police brutality, it does empower C.J. to think she has invented a loophole around it. That is the dream worth cherishing.

2019,‘Shadow’ Review: A Bleak World Splashed With Red,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. After the limp 2017 film “The Great Wall,” the director Zhang Yimou was clearly looking to enact a return to form. With “Shadow,” Zhang has done more than that: He’s created a martial-arts movie landmark, as strong in its performances as it is spectacularly novel in its violence. From the opening shots, the film announces itself as something special. A text preamble situates the story line during a peaceful era in the “Three Kingdoms” era of Chinese history. But the world of “Shadow” is neither placid nor realistic in appearance. Zhang, the cinematographer Zhao Xiaoding and the production designer Ma Kwong Wing have drained it of color. The characters have pale flesh tones, yes, but their surroundings are black and white and countless gradations of gray. Pei’s vainglorious king (Zheng Kai) seems to have achieved an admirable goal: His policies have kept his territory out of war. But he is a cruel leader. The king’s commander, suffering from a lingering disease, has made a slave of his peasant double and trained him to agitate against the king’s craven pacifism. The commander and his “shadow,” both played by Deng Chao, are locked in morbid codependency, and both are passionately in love with the same woman, the Commander’s wife (Sun Li). The deceptions are unending. The convolutions of court intrigue are head-spinning enough. Once the action scenes begin, though, they bring with them a new level of exhilaration. Just when you believe the movie can’t get any crazier, it does, interrupting the gray world with shocks of dark red.

2019,‘Shaft’? We’re Talking About Gordon Parks … and We Can Dig It,"race stories A look at how the photographer translated his humanistic view of urban crime to the silver screen. If there is a pantheon of black action heroes, John Shaft is a shoo-in. The suave private eye with a heart — and a mission — has endured for almost half a century. Now as Richard Roundtree reprises his iconic role for the film franchise’s fifth installment, Samuel L. Jackson and Jessie T. Usher Jr. join him as family members fighting injustice (and looking cool, all the while). The early films in the series exemplified the blaxploitation genre, the first generation of action films aimed at urban black audiences. Unbelievably, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer originally envisioned the 1971 film with an all-white cast. Luckily, the studio realized there was an untapped — and potentially lucrative — demographic yearning to see heroes that looked like and lived among them. While critics faulted blaxploitation movies for perpetuating stereotypes and sexism and glorifying violence, others hailed “Shaft” for its social consciousness, as the film helped change how mainstream Hollywood viewed African-Americans and good guys on film The upcoming movie is a wry, satirical follow up to its earlier and more serious predecessors and invites a look back at the original, which was directed not by a Hollywood stalwart but by one of the greatest photographers of the twentieth century: Gordon Parks. He saw “Shaft” as a “fun” film that could also inspire viewers of color. In the context of a movie industry that largely ignored them or trafficked in stereotypes, the film offered “a hero they hadn’t had before,” as he later observed. A critical and financial success, it led the way for other black directors in Hollywood. What is less understood, but equally important, is the relationship between “Shaft” and Mr. Parks’s earlier work, particularly his groundbreaking photographs. The film would not be the first time he portrayed the urban underworld through his measured lens. In his first photo essay for Life magazine, “Harlem Gang Leader,” published in 1948, Mr. Parks attempted to challenge how mainstream media portrayed African-Americans and crime. He documented the daily life of 17-year-old Leonard “Red” Jackson, leader of the Midtowners, a Harlem gang. Mr. Parks gained his trust, becoming a “welcome companion in all of [his] activities, including diplomatic sessions with other gangs, fights, quiet moments at home, even a visit to a funeral chapel to examine the wounds of a deceased member of a friendly gang.” Mr. Parks hoped the story would encourage support for social programs to help at-risk youth. But the range of images he took for the story, in contrast to those that editors selected, suggest that his concept differed considerably from his editors. In its published version — where photos were selected for dramatic effect and some aggressively cropped — the photo-essay failed to portray the teenager’s studiousness and stable family life. Harlem’s vitality and cultural richness were also missing, being represented instead as foreboding and desolate. In contrast to Life’s brooding edit, Mr. Parks documented Mr. Jackson and his family and friends in a way that underscored their humanity and complexity. In this way, he had hoped to challenge stereotypes and engender understanding, highlighting both similarities and differences between his black urban subjects and Life’s largely white, middle class readership. Another photo-essay he did for Life, “The Atmosphere of Crime,” was similarly nuanced and multifaceted. For six weeks in 1957, Mr. Parks documented inner-city crime in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. His images offered a glimpse into the largely hidden world of delinquency, policing and incarceration. Finally, after nearly a decade of well-received photo essays, his editors were more comfortable with his singular vision. Mr. Parks’s photographs departed from popular media’s typically romanticized, melodramatic or judgmental view of crime. Sometimes working closely with police, other times photographing alone with his collaborator, Henry Suydam, a journalist, he treated his controversial subjects of all races with compassion and care. They included a prisoner in Chicago, cigarette in one hand, the other anxiously grasping the jail cell bars, belying his stoicism; police frisking a suspect, his “hands high and trembling in the eerie light;” and young men playing poker on a New York sidewalk, minutes before police break up their game. With “Shaft,” Mr. Parks translated his humanistic view of urban crime to the screen, inverting racial stereotypes: The film’s hero is black, while some of its villains are white. Ed Guerrero, a film historian, noted that the film’s “thematic emphasis on black confrontation with, or victory over, white oppression,” departed significantly from stereotypes that emphasized white benevolence and black weakness or pathology, if not outright invisibility. But in contrast to Hollywood’s emerging awareness of African-Americans — and the need to engage them to boost box office sales — “Shaft” was the culmination of Mr. Parks’s longstanding and multidimensional exploration of race, poverty and crime, providing yet another rich and empathetic view of a fraught and complicated nation.

2019,"‘She Asked Where I Was Headed. Just Wandering, I Said.’","METROPOLITAN DIARY Outside an East Village thrift shop, spotting the perfect bag on the No. 6 and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I had been wanting to visit a certain secondhand shop in the East Village for some time. When I finally went, there was a sign taped to the door: “Out to lunch — Back in 10!” I decided to wait. An older woman approached the store, tried the door, muttered something under her breath and tried the door again. I thought I understood bits of what she said. “Do you speak Chinese?” I asked in Mandarin. “Yes,"" she responded in Cantonese. Mandarin and Cantonese are distinct enough that those who only speak one or the other can struggle to communicate. The woman and I cobbled together a lingua franca through hand-waving and the bits of Mandarin and Cantonese we both could understand. She said she was looking for a bowl. I said I wasn’t looking for anything in particular. Ten minutes passed with no sign of the storekeeper. The woman indicated that she wasn’t going to wait. She asked where I was headed. Just wandering, I said. She took me by the shoulders and pivoted me so that I was facing down the street. I couldn’t understand where she wanted me to go, but she was so insistent that I started walking. We exchanged shouted goodbyes. By the time I looked back, she had disappeared around the corner. — Madelyne Xiao Dear Diary: Some years ago, I was on a crowded E train going from Penn Station to my job when I heard a clunk. At my feet was an iPod touch with the earbuds attached and an iridescent green cover. I bent down, picked it up and asked the people around me if any of them had dropped it. No takers. When I got to work, I called Apple to see whether they could connect me with the owner. No luck. The next day, I waited on the Penn Station platform near where I had gotten on the train the day before. An E train arrived, and people started to get off. I held up the iPod touch. “Did you drop this yesterday?” I said into the crowd. “Yes,” a man said, stepping toward me. I said that if he could enter the correct passcode, he could have it. He did. I asked him for a hug, and then I took the next train to work. — Lynne Bunnell Dear Diary: It was a hot Saturday night, and construction at the Queens-Midtown Tunnel had snarled things so badly that nothing was moving. Several bored police officers with flashlights were trying to keep things under control. One of them, a woman, was dancing with her flashlight. She looked to be having a great time. Suddenly, a large man got out of a big white Lincoln and approached her. I was worried that he was ready to pick a fight. Instead, he started dancing with her for a minute or two until traffic began to move again. Then he got back in his car and drove away. — Jean Speiser Dear Diary: One day in 1977 after leaving Lehman College in the Bronx, I was walking to the Kingsbridge Road subway station when a car approached. A guy sitting on the passenger side flashed a watch out the window. I waved my hand dismissively. A few days later, I left my house in Woodside, Queens. As I walked down the block, I saw a car slow down. It was the same guy showing me a watch. “I told you no on Goulden Avenue in the Bronx the other day and I’m telling you no again,” I said without missing a beat. “Stop following me.” — John Doherty Dear Diary: I was on a downtown No. 6 train. There was a woman standing across from where I was sitting who was holding onto the pole with one hand and holding her cellphone in the other. Her shoulder bag caught my eye. Mine had been falling apart for a long time, and hers was the one I had dreamed about but never found: the perfect size and shape, with pockets in the right places. I couldn’t tell the brand from where I was sitting. I would have to ask her. But her demeanor seemed to say, “Stay away!” When she wasn’t staring at her cellphone, she was staring into space, preoccupied. If I didn’t grab the moment, she would get off and I would regret not having asked. I stood up and approached her. “Excuse me,” I said. She glanced up toward me, expressionless, and removed her earbuds. I took a deep breath. “I really like your bag and am wondering where you got it.” My knees were shaking slightly. “Seriously?” she said. “I’ve been admiring your pants and wondering where you got them, but wasn’t sure if I should ask you.” — Meryl Danziger Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘Ship of Horror’: Discovery of the Last Slave Ship to America Brings New Hope to an Old Community,"MOBILE, Ala. — Like nearly everyone who grew up in Africatown, Felice Harris had heard the origin story of her little Alabama neighborhood, passed around from relative to relative and house to house. It was the story of a group of West Africans carried to Alabama on the last slave ship to reach the United States. After the Civil War, they established and governed a thriving community of their own. Ms. Harris, a retired kindergarten teacher, knew that the story of the ship and its human cargo was well documented by historians, and she told it to her students each year. But she occasionally wondered how much myth had seeped into the history — because the ship, which was said to have been burned and sunk in the waters nearby, had never been found. Last week, all such doubts evaporated. A team of researchers confirmed that a submerged wooden wreck lodged in the mud a few miles up the Mobile River from the Africatown settlement was almost certainly the Clotilda, the schooner that had carried the 110 kidnapped Africans to Alabama from what is now the nation of Benin in 1860. Historians lauded the discovery as a crucial missing piece of the broader American story. In Africatown, a semi-isolated clutch of cottages three miles north of downtown Mobile, the news carried a particular kind of heft. Something physical, something measurable, was now attached to the tale they had heard all their lives. “Now it’s like letting us know that it’s really real,” said Ms. Harris, 58. “It’s real.” While it is too soon to say whether the Clotilda will be raised or restored — and if it is, where exactly it will go — the people of Africatown are already dreaming that the ship’s bones will reside with them, serving as a key not only to the past but to the future, attracting tourists and sparking a much-needed renaissance. “We think it could be something like Jamestown,” said Joe Womack, 68, referring to the early colonial settlement and tourist draw in Virginia. “Jamestown and Africatown.” The story of the Clotilda’s final voyage began with an Alabama plantation and steamboat owner, Timothy Meaher. As tensions between North and South approached a breaking point before the Civil War, Mr. Meaher made a wager that he could bring enslaved Africans to the heart of American cotton country despite a federal ban on importation that had been in effect since 1808. The bet grew out of an argument among passengers on one of Mr. Meaher’s steamships over whether transporting enslaved people from Africa to the United States was still possible. The stakes were high: Such smuggling was punishable by hanging. To avoid detection, the captain of the schooner, William Foster, set the vessel ablaze and sank it after its human cargo was unloaded. The captives were men, women and children from multiple cultures who spoke multiple languages. They had endured a trans-Atlantic voyage of 45 days, during which they had been stripped of clothing and given only meager daily sips of water, according to “Dreams of Africa in Alabama,” a book on the subject by the historian Sylviane Anna Diouf. Some of the captives were sold upriver. Mr. Meaher and his family kept 60 of them. They were in a country that was already home to 3.9 million slaves, according to 1860 census figures. In Alabama alone, there were more than 435,000 slaves. The free labor they provided made the state one of the most prodigious cotton producers in the South, where many politicians viewed slavery as a matter to be left up to individual states. In recent decades, the community they eventually founded has suffered steep economic decline. Several nearby mills and industrial plants have died off, including a paper plant that employed hundreds of local people. A self-contained commercial network died with them. Grocery stores, beauty shops, a fish market, service station and fruit stand — all are gone. “We’re a food desert,” said Cleon Jones, 76, the former New York Mets outfielder who grew up in Africatown and returned in the 1970s after helping lead the team to its storied 1969 World Series victory. He now serves as a kind of unofficial mayor. Mr. Jones said the population has diminished to less than 2,000 from a peak of 12,000 a few decades ago. Lovingly tended little homes abut others that are boarded up, their lots gone to weeds. A welcome center was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Around the corner, a mural painted by a local artist, Labarron Lewis, depicts the Clotilda gliding on the water under a serene blue sky. The management and guardianship of what remains of the Clotilda now falls to the state of Alabama. The ship is still fully submerged upriver, near a place called Twelvemile Island. On Thursday, the day after state officials announced that the ship had been identified, Ben Raines, the documentarian and former journalist who found it, headed toward the island in his motorboat, following the Clotilda’s final path. Mr. Raines, 49 and the son of Howell Raines, a former executive editor of The New York Times, announced in January 2018 that he may have discovered the Clotilda. He turned out to be wrong that time, and the story became a source of embarrassment for him. But some of the friends he had made in Africatown during his expeditions urged him to not to quit the search. Thelma Maiben-Owens, 66, the director of a community garden in Africatown, put the words of old an church song in his ear: “There’s a bright side somewhere. Don’t you stop until you find it.” On the water, Mr. Raines headed north, passing the towering cranes at the Port of Mobile, and then Africatown, until the river banks teemed with cypress and saw palmetto, as wild as they must have seemed in 1860. An orange buoy was floating near the place where Mr. Raines found a second ship. the one that experts now agree is the Clotilda. An Alabama Marine Resources Enforcement boat was anchored there, and a man was affixing a camera to a tree. Mr. Raines said the wreck was perhaps five feet below the surface, largely intact, and “cockeyed in the mud.” Many of the men and women left on the shore by Mr. Foster had hoped to return to Africa at the end of the Civil War, but their plans proved unworkable and they found themselves stuck. So they established Africatown, their own American settlement, in either 1866 or 1868. Some families bought land from former slave masters — Mr. Meaher, according to Ms. Diouf’s book, refused to give any land away. They chose as a leader an African man of noble birth, who eventually changed his name to Peter Lee. By the mid-20th century, Africatown was in full flourish. Mr. Jones and others of his generation described a place where workers walked to their factory jobs and neighbors shared the bounty of redfish and speckled trout caught out on the river. But the pride back then was complicated, Mr. Jones said, noting that many Americans had distorted views of what it meant to be called “African.” “Africa had a stigma,” he said. “I remember going to Prichard Park as a young teenager — the white boys would say, ‘Go back to Africa.’ “My reaction always was, ‘Take me back! You brought me over here.’” Joycelyn Davis, 42, is a sixth-generation direct descendant of a Clotilda survivor named Charlie Lewis. For years, she said, she did not feel like celebrating her family story. “Who wants to know you were brought over on a bet?” she said. But as she grew older, she read up on her past, and on the achievements of the Clotilda survivors. “Thriving and striving and settling and starting their own homes with less,” she said. “That builds my sense of pride. That shame has dwindled down to nothing.” These days, the neighborhood is a jumble of pride and hardship and hope, of celebrating the past and wrestling with it. Mr. Womack is a co-founder of an environmental group, and one of numerous Africatown plaintiffs in a lawsuit that accuses International Paper, the operator of the shuttered paper plant, of releasing harmful chemicals into the community. (The company has denied wrongdoing). On Thursday afternoon, Ms. Maiben-Owens, the community garden director, showed the empty lots where the stores used to be, but also the garden, lush in the late spring heat with peas, corn, okra and sugar cane. She showed a crooked brick chimney, the revered remains of Peter Lee’s house. She showed the old cemetery, with its big marker commemorating Cudjoe Kazoola Lewis, who was on the Clotilda and died in 1935, one of the last of the survivors of the Middle Passage. And she showed the messy lot where the welcome center used to be. There are plans for a replacement, to be financed by settlement money from BP after an immense oil spill from an offshore rig in 2010. The new community center, Ms. Maiben-Owens said, is where the Clotilda belongs. “Nobody talked about that ship until they found it,” she said. “Now they probably want to put it in Montgomery or something, where it has no place being.” Dr. Diouf said in an interview on Saturday that the next chapter for the Clotilda might not be settled for years. “But hopefully this infamous ship would bring something good to the community,” she said. “That’s the only hope. Because the ship itself is a ship of horror.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Shéhérazade’ Review: Love in the Mean Streets of Marseille,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It’s rare that a director’s first feature film, accomplished with an ensemble of nonprofessional actors, proves to be as quietly powerful as Jean-Bernard Marlin’s simple but lyrical “Shéhérazade.” Set in a poor quarter of grimy Marseille, the film, now on Netflix, bears little resemblance to the storytelling temptress of “The Arabian Nights.” But Marlin’s Shéhérazade (Kenza Fortas), dewy and gutsy, is temptress enough for Zachary (Dylan Robert), who is just out of juvenile detention. He sneaks away from the transitional living center where his social worker deposited him, ready to pick up life where he left off. Shunned by the leader of his old gang because of the taint of his incarceration, he finds he is also unwelcome at home, where his mother has a new boyfriend with no intention of letting a violent, nearly grown man move in. Zach hits the streets, broke and homeless, and is taken in by Shéhérazade, a prostitute who is no older than he is. In her single bed, they look like children. At first, it’s all about money to Zach, who sets his sights on becoming a pimp and incurs some debts along the way, not admitting to himself his love for her. Strikingly, the film paints Marseille in the smeary red, yellow and green light of a traffic signal. Throbbing colors obscure the action as if the movie were filmed through a dirty windshield, cranking up the tension. Most of the shots are tight, emphasizing the sense of suffocation and the lack of choices Zach and Shéhérazade have. The only times they escape the confines of their environment — and the only times we see the sea, or the horizon — are when the two are speeding down the road on a motorcycle. The neighborhood’s claws won’t release them for long, as Zach learns when his friends make it clear they consider Shéhérazade to be no more than a piece of property for their use. When Zach is faced with an ugly choice, even his negligent mother shows up to remind him that doing the right thing means keeping his mouth shut.

2019,‘Slave’ Details Her Daily Life in Testimony at Sex Cult Founder’s Trial,"The woman testified she was forced into sexual relations by the group’s founder. “Everything was just lies and deceit and darkness,” she said. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] A former member of the so-called sex cult Nxivm on Wednesday gave the first detailed description of the day-to-day life of a “slave” within the group, saying that “everything was just lies and deceit and darkness.” The witness, who was identified in court only as Sylvie and who testified for several hours, described being recruited by a “master,” feeling compelled to allow the leader of the group, Keith Raniere, to perform oral sex on her and narrowly avoiding being branded with his initials. Mr. Raniere, 58, who has been indicted on several charges, including racketeering conspiracy, extortion, forced labor and sex trafficking, co-founded Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um) as a self-help organization in the 1990s. Prosecutors, however, have said that he used the organization to exert control over the lives of his followers, including women who joined a clandestine sorority — known as D.O.S. — within the group. [Update: Former Nxivm cult official describes inner workings of “evil” group.] Women who joined that group were referred to as “slaves” and were obliged to turn over to other members, known as “masters,” compromising or embarrassing material. This “collateral” would ensure their unquestioning compliance, prosecutors have said. Sylvie said that soon after joining D.O.S. she was directed by her “master,” Monica Duran, to ask Mr. Raniere to photograph her and “go along with whatever else happened.” Sylvie said that she met Mr. Raniere, who was known within Nxivm as “Vanguard,” inside a house where he told her to undress. He then performed oral sex on her. Even though she did not want any sexual contact with him, she testified that she felt powerless to object, adding, “That was a command from my master and that was my role as a slave.” After the oral sex, Sylvie said that Mr. Raniere told her, “Now you’re part of the inner circle.” He then photographed her vagina. “All around that time I felt so much shame about this cult thing,” she testified, her voice breaking. “Everything was just lies and deceit and darkness.” Later, while being questioned by a defense lawyer, Sylvie acknowledged that she told Mr. Raniere after the encounter that she loved him. Sylvie, who grew up in Britain, came to the United States when she was 18 and lived on a farm where she took care of horses belonging to Clare Bronfman, the Seagram’s liquor heiress who was a high-ranking member of Nxivm. Over the next decade the group exerted a pull on her, according to her testimony. At one point, she said, Mr. Raniere suggested she leave a job she had obtained with Goldman Sachs. Ms. Bronfman also told her she would have to quit a running club she was part of. Sylvie testified that she joined a Nxivm-related group called Jness that she said espoused, among other things, that women were victimizers who liked to pose as victims. “I started to hate the fact that I was a woman,” she said. By the time Sylvie was invited to join D.O.S. — the initials are an acronym for a Latin phrase that roughly translates to “Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions” — she was eager to join, she testified. She thought it might help her improve as a person, she said, even though she had no idea what being part of the group would entail. She said she provided collateral in the form of a letter where she claimed to her parents that she was a prostitute. In her roughly two years with D.O.S., Sylvie said, she followed any directive given to her by Ms. Duran, including the order to recruit “slaves” of her own and obtain collateral from them. She was also compelled by Ms. Duran, she said, to provide additional collateral of her own, including a letter that gave Ms. Duran the power to say whether or not Sylvie could have children. Ms. Duran directed Sylvie to walk her dog, pick up her prescriptions and do her grocery shopping, she testified. She said Ms. Duran also gave her a necklace called a “dog collar” that was meant to symbolize their relationship and came with what was supposed to be an unbreakable clasp. At a certain point, Sylvie said, she was told that other D.O.S. members were being branded with Mr. Raniere’s initials and she heard that some were being struck with paddles. Newspaper stories and blog posts about the group began to appear and D.O.S.’s activities seemed to slow down as a result. Sylvie’s branding, which she said was in the process of being scheduled, never took place. Mr. Raniere began Nxivm in the 1990s in an Albany suburb, offering workshops and promising to teach participants the way to greater fulfillment. About 16,000 people took Nxivm courses, paying thousands of dollars apiece. Five women who were charged alongside him have pleaded guilty, leaving Mr. Raniere to stand trial alone. High-profile acolytes of Mr. Raniere included Ms. Bronfman and Allison Mack, an actress known for her role in the television series “Smallville.” Ms. Mack, one of the women who was charged as a co-defendant and has pleaded guilty, recruited other women into D.O.S., prosecutors have said. On cross-examination by Mr. Raniere’s lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, Sylvie acknowledged that her collateral was never made public, and said that she had disobeyed directions by erasing messages between her and Mr. Raniere. She also said that the “majority of the time” Mr. Raniere was “sweet” to her. Mr. Agnifilo presented Sylvie with a series of messages that she had exchanged with Mr. Raniere in 2016 and 2017 on the messaging system WhatsApp. Several messages that she sent included photographs showing parts of her nude body; affectionate-like emojis (such as hearts); and requests to meet with Mr. Raniere, according to Mr. Agnifilo’s descriptions. The messages were shown to Sylvie but not to the courtroom gallery. Sylvie said that she sent frequent messages to Mr. Raniere as part of what she perceived as her D.O.S. obligations. Although she did not actually love Mr. Raniere, she added, she thought she had probably told him many times that she did. “If I was the best slave,” she said she believed, “things would work out for me.”",The New York Times
2019,‘So Help Me God’ No More: Democrats Give House Traditions a Makeover,"WASHINGTON — The witness rose from her seat, raised her right hand and swore to tell the truth before Congress. But four words were missing: “So help me God.” In the House of Representatives, to the winner go the spoils, and Democrats, the new decision makers, control everything, including what legislation gets a vote and the minutiae of procedural choices, such as whether witnesses must utter the traditional plea for divine aid. Democratic chairmen and chairwomen of several key committees have deemed no such entreaty is necessary. “I think God belongs in religious institutions: in temple, in church, in cathedral, in mosque — but not in Congress,” said Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. What Republicans are doing, he continued, “is using God.” “And God doesn’t want to be used,” he said. No surprise, Republican lawmakers are staging a form of protest, jumping in when they can to point out each omission in real time. “I am a sinner, I make mistakes every single day, but I do think that we could use a little more of God, not less,” Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana earnestly told his colleagues seated around the dais of the House Natural Resources Committee. But weak is the hand without the gavel, and the change of phrasing is only one decision of many that the majority gets to make on Capitol Hill, where tradition reigns until it does not and every choice is freighted with subtext. In 2003, Republicans famously rebranded the French fries and French toast offered in House cafeterias “freedom fries” and “freedom toast” to express dissatisfaction with Gallic opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. When Democrats wrested control of the chamber three years later, they introduced compostable silverware and cups — a decision Republicans swiftly reversed when they came to power in 2011, arguing that the utensils were too flimsy to properly spear salad fixings. The Democrats in power now have yet to touch the culinary nomenclature of the House cafeterias. (There appears to be no Russian dressing available for them to snub.) But they have introduced a number of other changes, each carrying its own symbolism: Free feminine hygiene products are now made available to offices. Several committee leaders have excised the gendered titles of “chairman” or “chairwoman” for the neutral mononym “chair” — though The New York Times’s style remains gender-specific. And in a bid to become more eco-friendly, the Committee on Natural Resources swapped out single-use plastic water bottles for glassware at hearings. (One defiant Republican on the panel continues to bring in his own plastic bottle because he considers using glassware to be unsanitary.) The single change that has prompted the most ire, however, is what Republicans contend is a concerted effort to omit the phrase “so help me God” when administering witness oaths. They point to examples on the Judiciary, Energy and Commerce, and Natural Resources committees; each person presiding over the panels has the power to decide to administer an oath as well as what that oath says. But like most Washington spats, the truth is more complicated. When Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, who heads the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, conducted a hearing and swore the witnesses in without the phrase, for example, Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, jumped in to point out that “the oath was incorrect and incomplete.” “This is the oath we use,” Ms. DeGette replied, “and that’s the oath we’re going to use today.” No matter how small the teacup, such congressional tempests do get refracted through a partisan prism. The Center for Inquiry, a nonprofit group dedicated to fostering “a secular society based on reason, science, freedom of inquiry and humanist values,” cheered Ms. DeGette’s “support for the constitutional separation of church and state.” Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, scoffed to Fox News that House Democrats “really have become the party of Karl Marx.” But in truth, Ms. DeGette’s comment — “this is the oath we use” — carried no underlying meaning. She was not making a defiant secular stand, but merely reading from the same committee decorum rule book that her Republican predecessor, Representative Gregg Harper of Mississippi, had used to administer oaths, videos show. In this case, Ms. DeGette’s omission was unintentional. But some Democrats have mounted ideological defenses of truncating the oath to avoid references to religion. When Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, interrupted Mr. Cohen to ask that witnesses be sworn in again — or at least be asked if they would prefer to recite the traditional oath, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, who leads the Judiciary Committee, interjected. “We do not have religious tests,” he said, and moved the hearing along. Such arguments have troubled Republicans like Mr. Johnson, who has been on the front lines of efforts to make the oath invoke God again. He pulled Mr. Nadler aside on the House floor to discuss the issue and directed his office to produce short video montages illustrating it. He believes in the cause. “The intention behind it was to express the idea that the truth of what was being said was important not just in the moment, but would go into eternity, and someone was watching and would ultimately be our judge,” Mr. Johnson said. “Some would call that mere symbolism, but to many of our founders, it was deeper than that.” Mr. Johnson said he would continue his crusade, and he has already seen some results. “To his credit,” he said of Mr. Nadler, “We had a hearing where he used ‘so help me God.’ I leaned over and winked at him.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘St. George’ Tiller: Abortion With Compassion,"letter An obstetrics professor fondly recalls Dr. George Tiller, who was murdered a decade ago. To the Editor: Re “Doctors Who Risk Their Lives” (editorial, May 26): In your acknowledgment of the 10th anniversary of the murder of Dr. George Tiller, you rightly point to his courage in the face of relentless attacks by his opponents. But there is another element of Dr. Tiller’s legacy that bears mention. In the close-knit world of the abortion-providing community in the United States, Dr. Tiller was routinely referred to, without irony, as “St. George.” This was because of his generosity and compassion. Providers from all over the country would routinely refer their most difficult cases to him — women who discovered that their pregnancies had gone horribly wrong late in pregnancy, 11-year-old girls who had been raped by a relative and barely understood that they were pregnant. These colleagues knew that these patients would be cared for with the utmost kindness and sensitivity, and often without charge.

2019,‘Start the Music!’,"daily crossword column Gary Cee encourages us to dance through his crossword puzzle. MONDAY PUZZLE — The constructor Gary Cee makes his living in radio as a senior vice president of programming for iHeartRadio, so it is not surprising that he came up with this idea. 15A: Hi, kids! Knowledge of the old comedy greats is information that should be passed down from generation to generation so it is not lost. Stan Laurel and Oliver (“OLLIE”) Hardy were a comic duo who made some of the most beloved movies and shorts of the early 20th century. OLLIE Hardy is the chap with the mustache. 32A: There are some who may say that ROLFing is different than intense massage, which is what the clue says. Either way, it is not your relaxing form of massage, with candles and music, so the focus should be on the word “intense,” as in “When I got Rolfed, I left the session in tense condition.” 36A: You can put on a black coat if you’re leaving the house, but you can also put on a coat of TAR, which would be black. 55A: I typically think of “ … a gift from above” as “heaven sent,” but the answer here is GOD SENT. Fun fact: The phrase GOD SENT has not appeared in The New York Times Crossword in nearly 70 years. 65A: Have you ever come across an entry in a crossword puzzle and just said, Oh, come on! That’s not a word?

2019,‘Step Up’ Is One of Pop Culture’s Most Enduring Franchises. How Did That Happen?,"In 2006, “Step Up” arrived at the tail end of something like a dance craze in American cinema, an era of sprightly, sweat-streaked films such as “Save the Last Dance,” “You Got Served,” and “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.” The movie — a low-budget drama about a young ne’er-do-well who strives to prove his worth in a ballet recital at a prestigious inner-city arts school — was an unlikely candidate for blockbuster status, even on the heels of Fox’s “So You Think You Can Dance,” which debuted the year before. Yet it proved extraordinarily successful, earning over $100 million worldwide and spawning four lucrative sequels and, most recently, a hit TV series. Season 2 of that series, “Step Up: High Water,” had its premiere on YouTube Premium in March, and the first episode was watched more than 10 million times in its first week, according to the streaming service. As of early May, it had 17.8 million views. The franchise’s endurance more than a decade later is even more surprising than the original film’s splash: Such continual triumphs are typically reserved for big, special effects-heavy fantasy epics like “Harry Potter” or “Star Wars,” not modest, cheerful underdog stories about competitive street dancing, in which the only action consists of pops, locks and twirls. And unlike most long-running properties, the films and the show share little in common with one another: There’s no ongoing story, no recurring central figure for audiences to emotionally invest in from sequel to sequel. (Moose, a fan favorite played by Adam G. Sevani, is virtually the only significant character to appear in more than two of the five movies.) What is it about “Step Up” and its various offshoots that have made it apparently so irresistible to viewers for so long? The first film set itself apart from other dance-heavy movies by foregrounding the narrative; it was set in the world of dance, but wasn’t expressly about it. “What was important to us was that it wasn’t just a dance movie, but that it was a drama with a dance element,” explained Adam Shankman, the director of “The Wedding Planner” and “A Walk To Remember,” and producer of the “Step Up” movies. “You know, kids from opposite sides of the tracks finding each other.” For “Step Up,” Shankman hired Anne Fletcher, a choreographer he describes as his best friend, to direct the film; the script was penned by Duane Adler (“Save the Last Dance”) and Melissa Rosenberg (the “Twilight” movies). Because Shankman and Fletcher had both worked in dance, they were keen, Shankman said, “to have people who could really dance.” They cast the up-and-coming actor and dancer Channing Tatum as the lead. When the movie was released in August 2006, Shankman and Fletcher were in Toronto, working on the remake of “Hairspray.” Shankman remembers going to a theater on opening night and being surprised to find “a line around the block to get in.” The movie cost $12 million to make. It earned that back nearly 10 times over. Around this time, Universal Studios had begun churning out a number of direct-to-video sequels to “Bring It On,” the popular high school cheerleader comedy. Summit Entertainment, the studio behind “Step Up,” approached Shankman and his co-producers about doing the same. “We went, ‘Sure, why not?’” said Shankman. “Step Up 2: The Streets,” released in 2008, feels more like a spinoff than a true sequel. Tyler Gage, the delinquent-turned-dancer played by Tatum in the first “Step Up,” appears only for a few moments to pass the baton to the new protagonist Andie, played by Briana Evigan. The story is similar: Kids from opposite sides of the tracks find each other, again. But where the first film strove to prioritize drama over dance, the second is more interested in the acrobatic gyrating of its capable stars. If “Step Up” is a “drama with a dance element,” “Step Up 2” is a dance movie straight-up. “Step Up 2” is considerably more entertaining than its predecessor, full of ecstatic brio and Busby Berkeley-ish panache. That’s thanks in part to its director, Jon M. Chu, who went on to make last year’s enormously successful “Crazy Rich Asians.” Chu delights in the physicality of his young performers, and rather than pretend to care about the story, he relishes every opportunity to linger on bodies in motion — often at the expense of conventional niceties like character development and plot. “My whole thing was that if I’m going to do a dance movie sequel, I want more dancing,” Chu explained in a recent phone interview. “The first one had maybe four or five dance numbers. I wanted to fill this one with dance. It’s the language of the movie.” The goal, he added, was to make “sort of a dancical” — a musical with dance instead of song. “Jon always saw these kids as like superheroes,” Shankman said. “He really put front and foremost their talent, as opposed to the drama of their story.” The shift in emphasis proved to be a turning point for the series. The studio was so impressed by Chu’s vision it decided to scrap its original direct-to-video plan for “Step Up 2,” quadruple its budget and release it theatrically. It became an even bigger hit than “Step Up,” and the studio quickly greenlit a third. Chu returned to direct “Step Up 3D” — an idea inspired by “Captain EO,” the 3D dance movie made for Disney’s theme parks in the 1980s by an all-star creative team: It starred Michael Jackson and was written by George Lucas and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. (Chu had a nostalgic affection for the film.) At this point, Shankman admits now, “it started to feel a little weird”: What once had been a relatively serious drama “had lost the necessity for real-world stakes,” as all the studio seemed to want was “great-looking people and incredible dancing.” Others may argue this is exactly when the “Step Up” movies hit their stride. “Step Up 3D” abandons every pretense of conventional storytelling. The movie is about an underground dance studio for disadvantaged teenagers in New York City under threat of foreclosure by a bank demanding overdue rent. But, of course, there’s a dance competition coming up, and if the plucky heroes place first, they’ll be able to pay their bills with the prize money. Chu considered the making of “Step Up 3D” to be “amazingly fun,” and it shows. The movie is a buoyant, irrepressible marvel of sugar-rush frivolity. Like a great pop song, it doesn’t care about being serious, because not being serious is more fun. “Step Up 3D” was the most successful film of the franchise, earning more than $150 million globally. The two other films that followed — the Miami-based “Step Up Revolution” and the Vegas-set “Step Up All In” — were equally lighthearted, but excitement for the series began to wane. (“Revolution” earned $140 million and “All In” topped out at $86 million.) Looking back, Shankman attributes that lucrative run to the franchise’s positive spirit, which has been especially resonant among international audiences, not unlike the “Fast and the Furious” series. “Everybody can appreciate it,” he said. “You are not alienated by any part of it — it moves from culture to culture.” “Step Up High Water” feels more like a “Step Up” reboot than another “Step Up” sequel. None of the dancers or characters who romped and frolicked their way through the movies return. The series has gone back to its roots, again shifting its focus to a story rather than ostentatious footwork. This time it’s set at an elite performing arts school in Atlanta founded and bankrolled by the brilliant but megalomaniacal pop star Sage Odom (played by the real-life pop star Ne-Yo, channeling Kanye West). The school is fraught with romance, rivalry and gangland violence — a bit like “Degrassi,” with more dancing. The showrunner, Holly Sorensen, said that though she felt the movies were “delicious,” she wanted the show to be more “poignant and real.” “My pitch was really grounding it in reality as much as possible,” she said. It makes sense that “Step Up” would find new life on YouTube, where dance videos already thrive. The franchise began in a time when people eager to watch great dancing had to find it in movies or live performance. Now that content — and the audience for it — has largely drifted online. Susanne Daniels, YouTube’s head of original content, had been interested in bringing the franchise to the platform for a long time; viewers watched dance videos on YouTube over 80 billion times in 2018, she said. Shankman seems relieved by the franchise’s direction on the small screen and pleased with the back-to-basics approach of “High Water.” The drama has returned; the heroes, once more, are back firmly on opposite sides of the tracks. The movies eventually became too obsessed with being “bigger, bigger, bigger,” he said. “I kept going, like, where do you want to put it next? Space?” He is kidding, but you can see the appeal: zero-gravity dancing among the stars. Based on its track record and staying power, “Step Up” just might get there one day.",The New York Times
2019,‘Tell No One’: Poland Is Pushed to Confront Abuse of Children by Priests,"WARSAW — Anna Misiewicz was just 7 years old when she was invited into the private chambers of her parish priest, in the small village of Topola in southwest Poland. She thought he wanted her to count church donations. Instead, she found herself alone with a predator, identified only as Father Jan A. He touched her chest, stroked her body and forced her to use her hands to masturbate him. Decades later, the smell of milk disgusts her still, she said, “because the priest would drink milk and the taste stayed on his mouth and lingered in mine.” In a powerful new documentary that is rocking this deeply Roman Catholic nation, Ms. Misiewicz recalls these childhood nightmares, and then goes farther. She summons the courage to knock on the door of her abuser, a feeble old man but still a priest, and pose a simple question: Why? “I should never have done it,” the priest says quietly in a moment captured on secretly recorded video. It was “some stupid passion,” he says. He then offers an apology and asks to kiss her hand. She can barely contain her disgust. The scandal of abuse by priests is not new to Poland, documented by journalists and the church itself, and the pattern of offenses and cover-ups is a familiar one from Boston to Dublin. But in a country where the church continues to play a central role in personal and political life, the issue has remained largely in the shadows. No longer. The two-hour documentary, “Tell No One,” has transfixed the nation, viewed online more than 18 million times since it was released Saturday. “We are finally witnessing a national reckoning and it’s the same kind that brought justice in churches in other countries,” said Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, an activist and opposition lawmaker. “This film shows in black and white the systemic rot among the clergy.” Much of the abuse outlined in painful detail took place in the 1980s, when the church, led by Poland’s favorite son, Pope John Paul II, stood at the vanguard of the fight against Communism and Soviet control. The revelations have forced a painful discussion about how John Paul, now venerated as a saint, failed to take action to protect children. And the legacy of some priests who were considered heroes of that era is being called into question. One of them, the Rev. Henryk Jankowski, was known as “the chaplain of Solidarity” and was close to Lech Walesa, the movement leader who became Poland’s president. Last year, Father Jankowski, who died in 2010, was accused of abusing children. This year, activists pulled down a statue of him in Gdansk; officials restored it, but as more allegations surfaced, the city removed it. The fallout from the documentary is landing on a bitterly divided society that is wrestling with questions of its own identity. The governing Law and Justice Party portrays itself as a defender of Christendom and its values. Top party leaders have demonized gays and lesbians as a threat to the soul of the nation and accused the European Union of promoting a dangerous secular vision for the continent that is at odds with Polish identity. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the powerful leader of Law and Justice, has accused those who raise the issue of abuse by priests of seeking to undermine the church itself. The party’s support runs deepest in the country’s most religiously conservative corners, outside the major cities, where the church remains at the center of daily life. But as public outrage has grown, the government has been forced to respond, even if not mentioning the church by name. The Parliament this week moved toward imposing harsher punishments for those who abuse children, and eliminating the statute of limitation on prosecution of such crimes. “There will be no suspended sentences, there will be severe punishment, perhaps up to 30 years in prison,” Mr. Kaczynski said on Sunday. “And for everyone, regardless of what social functions they perform.” Other members of his party, however, have attacked the film as politically motivated. Ryszard Terlecki, a deputy speaker in the Parliament, noted that elections for the European Parliament were coming up this month. “I think it’s not a coincidence,” he said. “It fits into a kind of campaign against the church and us, Catholics.” At the same time, opposition parties have seized on the film. The left-wing Spring party sought to project it onto a building next door to a church headquarters in Warsaw but was stopped by the police. The documentary details not only a pattern of abuse that includes allegations of rape, but also the way the church in Poland has effectively shielded priests for decades. On several occasions, in deeply moving scenes, the victims of abuse confront their abusers. The documentary, which began filming in 2017, was made by a well-known television journalist, Tomasz Sekielski, and his brother, Marek Sekielski. It was financed through a crowdfunding campaign, with some 2,500 people donating a total of around $120,000. The archbishop of Gniezno, Wojciech Polak, and Stanislaw Gadecki, the archbishop of Poznan and president of Poland’s conference of bishops, refused to cooperate with the filmmakers. After the public outcry, they released statements saying that they were “moved” by the film. “This enormous suffering of the victims brings out pain and shame,” Archbishop Polak said on Saturday. “I apologize for every wound inflicted by the people of the church.” But other church leaders have sought to conflate the issue of abuse with homosexuality. Bishop Miroslaw Milewski of Plock, outside Warsaw, said in an interview for a private channel, Polsat News, that “it will be impossible to resolve the issue of pedophilia in church without touching upon the problem of the ‘lavender mafia,’ meaning people who have homosexual preferences or are homosexual.” His comments stand in stark contrast to those of Pope Francis, who has blamed the abuse crisis on clericalism, a view that excessively elevates priests and their authority. He has promised to address the crisis, and this month he unveiled the first church law obligating church officials worldwide to report cases of clergy sexual abuse and attempts to cover it up to their superiors. A study published by the Polish church in March found that from 1990 to mid-2018, church officials received abuse reports concerning 382 priests. The study, using data from over 10,000 parishes, said that in those 28 years, 625 children were sexually abused. Analysts said those numbers wildly underestimated the extent of the abuse. Critics also pointed out that the study did not include information about what happened to the perpetrators after they were discovered, including those who were just transferred to different parishes. The documentary shows how priests — even those convicted in criminal cases — were not only allowed to remain priests but, in one particularly shocking case, to also work directly with children. The Rev. Dariusz Olejniczak was caught on camera leading a retreat for children despite a lifetime ban on working with youth after being convicted of abusing children. After the film’s release, he filed a request to be removed from the priesthood. Marek Sekielski, the producer, said the film has been trending beyond Poland, in Iceland, Ireland, Norway and many other countries. There have been big promises in the past, but “the beautiful words of the highest church officials have often been contradicted by the priests’ actions,” he said. Still, he is hopeful. “The reception of our film has exceeded our highest expectations,” he said. “We do see that the film has triggered some real soul-searching among the clergy. We’ve been hearing voices from inside the church that a moment has come to truly change something.”",The New York Times
2019,‘The Ash Family’ Is a Debut Novel for Our Climate-Anxious Age,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE ASH FAMILY By Molly Dektar If the pall cast over previous generations was the pervasive fear of nuclear war, today’s all-consuming global anxiety is the threat of deadly weather. We’re already witnessing the effects of human-caused global warming — catastrophic hurricanes, droughts, heat waves and forest fires among them — and the window to prevent even worse weather, scientists say, is quickly closing. Despite this stark evidence, a recent Gallup poll found that only 45 percent of Americans believe climate change will pose a serious threat in their lifetime. What will it take to shake the skeptics and deniers from their mental torpor? The sinking of Mar-a-Lago under rising seas as a kind of anti-Atlantis? By then it may be too late. In Molly Dektar’s somber debut novel, “The Ash Family,” the protagonist wrestles with these same questions. How can a progressive-minded individual protect our battered earth in the face of widespread indifference and corporate greed? Beryl (“Berie” for short) is a recent high school graduate whose life takes a sharp turn when she meets a group that purports to have the answer. Raised in Durham, N.C., by a single mom who works two jobs and buys discount groceries to keep the household afloat, Berie is at a crossroads. Her mother believes that her only child’s ticket to a better future is a college education, so she sells a family heirloom to pay for it. Berie, however, yearns for what she calls “a more essential life”: “To me essential meant a life more connected to wild nature. I’d always known there was magic on the margins, there was a world beyond my mother’s world, where a dinner that ‘went off without a hitch’ meant a dinner where no one talked about anything that mattered. … She wanted a life of safety for me, as though safety were still possible on the choked earth. Safety was a relic from before humans destroyed the world.” Instead of enrolling in college, she follows a man named Bay who approaches her at a bus station, offering her the promise of a new family: a band of eco-terrorists living on a small farm in a secluded holler of the Blue Ridge Mountains. As a visitor, she’s told she may stay “three days or the rest of your life” — an ironclad rule that will take on dire overtones as the novel progresses. The Ash Family’s two dozen communards are ruled by Dice, a former power-plant engineer who had something of an enviro-epiphany when he noticed fish dying downstream from his work. A “small man with a slow smile,” Dice imposes a cultlike discipline on his ragged followers. He gives them new names and forbids them from falling in love, having children, taking “fake-world medicine,” reading or writing, even using phones or mirrors. Berie is renamed Harmony, and her long tresses are chopped off with sheep shears so her bad haircut matches the others’. When she volunteers to attend what she thinks will be a placid demonstration against coal mining, another member enlightens her: “We don’t really do protests. … We do direct action.” But before she can participate in such actions, “Harmony” must earn the group’s trust. She stays behind to muck out stalls and milk cows while the others train for secret missions. Dice periodically subjects her to mental or physical hazing to test her level of obedience. “The Ash Family” draws on literary conventions about extremist religious cults, but replaces the fear of eternal damnation with an ecological fear of a hell on earth. “Siberia will melt,” Dice warns his disciples. “The rain forests will burn down. The oceans will stop mixing. And the wars will start.” For a novel about an eco-terrorist cell, there is very little action here. In the two years Berie lives with the group, the communards do little besides farm chores, dumpster-diving and cooking up napalm. Evenings are spent listening to Dice’s gloomy lectures or singing Baptist hymns (of all things) a cappella. When a violent confrontation finally does occur, it happens off-page. Instead of plot, the bulk of the narrative is devoted to Berie’s internal debates, observations and rationalizations, told in gem-cut sentences that kept me reading. The author clearly loves the natural world and has a gift for describing it. Berie hears the damp forest “fizzing” in the morning light; sees lightning “stalking over a ridge” like “spider legs.” The woods “ticked like a clock as they thawed.” The protagonist herself, however, is less fully rendered than her observations of the physical world around her. Berie remains passive, never questioning the leader’s arbitrary or cruel directives, and even taking his lies and hypocrisies in stride. She allows Bay, whom she adores, to physically harm her without complaint. (It’s also hard to believe that Berie’s mother wouldn’t organize a massive search when her daughter fails to show up for freshman orientation, or contact her at any point in two years.) Berie seems as lost at the end of the book as she was at the beginning. But perhaps that’s the point: Many of us are struggling with the best way to address our global emergency; it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and powerless. “The Ash Family” is truly a novel for our climate-anxious age. Last month, a new report found that coal-fired power plants have poisoned groundwater nationwide. How much worse can it get? “I wish nature could beat people up,” Berie tells Dice at one point. It’s hard not to imagine that the violent weather we’re experiencing is precisely nature’s way of doing that.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Big Bang Theory’ Draws 18 Million for Finale,"“The Big Bang Theory” ended its long, successful run with 18 million people tuning in for its series finale on Thursday night, according to Nielsen. “Big Bang” goes out on a high note: The CBS comedy will finish the season as the most-viewed entertainment show in all of network television. The series — created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady and starring Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki — finished with 279 episodes, the most of any multicamera situational comedy in television history. It surpassed “Cheers,” which had 275 episodes. [Read about the ways TV shows are stretching out their endings.] Where it did not surpass “Cheers” was the finale ratings: The final episode of “Cheers” in 1993 garnered a staggering 80.5 million viewers — a demonstration of just how much television has changed since then. The “Big Bang” numbers on Thursday also narrowly missed the premiere figures of ABC’s “Roseanne,” which debuted in March 2018 to 18.2 million viewers. So much of television is now watched on DVR or online. This year, “Big Bang” averaged 12.7 million viewers. With seven days of delayed viewing factored in, that number mushrooms to 17.3 million. That does not include online viewing. The show is currently in second place behind “This Is Us” and “The Masked Singer” in the key rating point among adults under the age of 50, but it’s possible that when a week’s worth of delayed viewing is included, the final episode of “Big Bang” could push it to first place among non-sports programs. (NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” is tops.) “Big Bang” is not the only finale this weekend: “Game of Thrones” will end its eight-year run on Sunday, and it is likely to set new ratings records. An earlier version of this article omitted the name of a creator of the series. In addition to Chuck Lorre, Bill Prady is also a co-creator.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Big Bang Theory’ and the Long Goodbye: How Swan Songs Are Changing TV,"Critic’s Notebook Two of the biggest shows on TV are ending this week: “The Big Bang Theory” finishes its 12th season on Thursday, and “Game of Thrones” ends its eighth season Sunday night. One’s a multicamera comedy that fits squarely within network traditions, the other’s a flashy fantasy epic chockablock with violent murder. One is symbolic — perhaps unfairly — of cultural uncoolness, while the other spawns viewing parties and obsessive podcasts from legacy media companies. And yet both are getting the same kind of finale rollout, the kind a lot of shows get these days, like “Veep” just had: an announcement well in advance of the premiere that the coming season would be the show’s last, a full-court media press of oral histories and it’s-hard-but-it’s-time talk show appearances, well-placed tributes from high-profile fans. Clip shows and after-shows. Photos from the final table read on the cast’s Instagram accounts, and then maybe a photo essay of the final days in a magazine. We’ve had months and months to gird ourselves. Which isn’t to say those finales will necessarily be good or beloved, just that fans of the shows have been well shepherded into the ideas that these shows are indeed ending. Big shows have always gotten fanfare finale rollouts, but in recent years, and especially for the 2018-19 season, network, cable and streaming outlets have been big on farewell seasons for smaller shows too. Netflix gave viewers ample warning about the end of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.” The final season of “Broad City” was one big goodbye, an almost therapeutic guide through the main characters’ maturation process and thus the end of the freewheeling-young-adult premise of the show. “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” walked its audience and its protagonist through all the show’s what-ifs. The series finale of “Catastrophe” achieved a kind of ecstatic perfection that gave me spiritual resolution in ways I cannot attain in regular life. I will be crushed when “Jane the Virgin” ends this summer, but I will be as prepared as possible. Every living person who watched FXX’s “You’re the Worst” wrote a loving eulogy to it on a website, or ranked its episodes, or praised its depictions of PTSD and depression one last time. Transitions, man. Anyone who’s ever torn a toddler from a playground or nudged a crowd from cocktail hour to the reception hall knows people need warning. We need structure. We need guidance. We need a dang minute to collect ourselves. We need closure. [Read two of our movie and TV critics on “Game of Thrones,” “Avengers” and the power of endings.] And we’ve been getting it more and more. The “Lost” finale was on the calendar for years, and now it feels standard for shows to get a chance to wrap themselves up and for fans to be aware of that process. The vigil for next year’s “Supernatural” series finale began before its current season even ended. To be clear, this isn’t a complaint. I love a warning period, and I love a mourning ritual. Even as ratings for any given show drop and drop, connecting with fellow fans has never been easier, and there’s something to be said for being able to dry one’s tears on infinity blog posts. “Goodbye” is better than “get lost,” even if the outcome is ultimately the same. But this kind of finale ramp has made the regular old cancellation model seem jarring and downright cruel. Not that it was ever comfy-cozy, but now a cancellation feels like “.” in a text message instead of a “!!!” or something more genteel. A cancellation without a true finale feels hostile, even though it was once completely normal. Fans treasured “One Day at a Time” because it was a funny, sweetheart show that represented marginalized people in humanizing, significant ways. And we could have accepted an ending — because all shows will end except the local news and “Wheel of Fortune.” (Take comfort, Constance Wu.) What was harder to accept was the abruptness of it all, the shock. Give us a six-episode farewell season like we’re human beings, for God’s sake. And the CW renewed every show on its roster, but ABC can’t figure out a way to give us even 13 more episodes of “Speechless”? I’m not saying any of those would be good business decisions. But I’m not a business. I’m a flabby human with a working heart, and I want a one-hour “Detroiters” special, and I’m mad that Comedy Central canceled the show in December instead. I could have loved you better, “Counterpart.” “Santa Clarita Diet” could have gone full-bonkers. The “Murphy Brown” reboot never got to have a crossover with “The Good Fight.” Finales have taken on a strange significance of their own as “sticking the landing” has become a meme unto itself — but also as reboots and revivals have meant the end of endings. They are now a precious spectacle, an impossible beauty, a relic. So having time to prepare the shrine doesn’t feel like so much to ask.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Biggest Little Farm’ Review: The Pleasures of D.I.Y. Agriculture,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Directed and narrated by John Chester, a longtime documentary cinematographer, “The Biggest Little Farm” opens with the then-seemingly unstoppable California wildfires of 2018 threatening to wipe out the small farm Chester founded with his wife, Molly, nearly 10 years before. The sight of Molly, who had been a chef and blogger before she and John got serious about their farm-to-table ideas, gathering clothes as billowing smoke is seen out the window behind her, is immediately tension-inducing. But here the movie flashes back to the cute reason the couple left Los Angeles to found a farm they would run in an old-school, anti-corporate-agriculture style. (It involves a promise made to a dog.) As depicted in the movie, the Chesters’ inexperience at the outset seems close to naïveté. It’s a little implausible, but it gives the movie a lot of narrative juice. Nature both gives and takes away and gives again as the Chesters work the land. Advised by their farm guru Alan York to embrace biodiversity, the couple stock the farm with all form of animal life. There’s enough organic waste (it’s good for the soil) to fill a couple of Troma movies. And sufficient animal blood and guts for an Italian cannibal picture. There are funny moments, too, as when York first shows up for his consulting gig, and John can’t get over the fact that the maestro is dressed in sandals and linen. If you’ve entertained “Green Acres”-inspired reveries on the joys of “farm living,” this documentary may rid you of them in short order. But it may also revive your wonder at the weird but ultimately awe-inspiring ways in which humans can help nature do its work.

2019,‘The Cat in the Hat’ and the Man Who Made That,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. BECOMING DR. SEUSS Theodor Geisel and the Making of an American ImaginationBy Brian Jay Jones At first, the subtitle of Brian Jay Jones’s new life of Dr. Seuss — “Theodor Geisel and the Making of an American Imagination” — seems ill chosen. Surely, the newly arriving reader thinks, it ought to be “Theodor Geisel and the Making of the American Imagination,” since few authors can have had more influence on the inner workings of the American mind than Geisel, who, in his guise as the good doctor of children’s books, reshaped everything from the beat of our doggerel to our notions of the ideal color of eggs and ham. But only halfway through the book the subtitle seems shrewdly chosen, and more than borne out by the material. Geisel’s sensibility, it turns out, was far more absorbent, and far more pliable, than one would have imagined, turned in many different directions by the winds of his era, and changed again and again by his contact with a kind of all-star roster of mid-20th-century creative exemplars. Unlike most of the great children’s book authors and illustrators — Edward Lear, Beatrix Potter — Geisel was not in any way an obsessive or driven visionary, a prisoner of childhood locked in his own imagery or mythology. Instead, he worked (and could have easily stayed in) advertising, animation and political cartooning — to all of which he was, you soon get the sense, more naturally inclined than to what he called, cheerfully, “brat books.” (He never had children of his own, nor seems to have liked other people’s much. “I like children in the same way that I like people,” was his tactful but giveaway standard answer.) Geisel/Seuss, it turns out, made a shrewd though far from cynical decision to write to, though never down to, an audience of children at a moment when that audience was becoming a market — and though his own values and imagination shaped the books he made, his choice to make those kinds of books in the first place turns out in part to have been a response to the new market for them. He was rooted in a place: There’s an actual Mulberry Street in Springfield, Mass., where Geisel grew up during the World War I era. His was a German-American family of a kind whose centrality to American experience would later get erased a bit by historical circumstance, but was an extremely strong cultural type — as celebrated by H. L. Mencken — for a long time. His father was a brewer, and Springfield, perhaps most significantly, a place where a culture of German and Yankee ingenuity was very much alive. (Basketball had been invented there in a lucky afternoon.) This spirit of cuckoo-clock engineering and enterprise was dominant for Geisel throughout his life — he was always ready for the new angle, the unexpected entrepreneurial approach to publishing, the sharp commercial play. After good college years at Dartmouth, where his natural style as a hard-edge, fluid-lined cartoonist was already in place, he quickly got to New York, where, in the 1920s, he pursued a joyful life as a freelance cartoonist at a time when that was a real career. From there he made a natural leap into advertising, becoming responsible for the “Quick, Henry! The Flit!” insecticide campaign that older people still smile to remember, and then, eager to find a way out of mere ad-making, in 1941 went to the progressive newspaper PM as their chief editorial cartoonist, where he was bravely anti-Lindbergh and sadly anti-Japanese-American. (The war had ugly effects on Geisel’s view of Asians, as it did on so many. In addition to the early anti-Japanese-American cartoons, a later image of a “Chinaman” from “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street” has been much condemned, and even eliminated, in its mural form, from the Seuss museum in Springfield. On the other hand, Jones establishes that the civilization of microscopic creatures called “Whos” in “Horton Hears a Who!” was inspired by a 1953 visit Geisel took to Japan and was his way of “offering an open hand of friendship to the Japanese. … telling them they mattered and deserved to be taken care of in a postwar world.”) What’s amazing is how completely consistent and identifiable Geisel’s style is from first to last and in all his modes, political or commercial, as later in his children’s books: the almond-shaped faces caught in wide-eyed emotion — always extreme, startled or snooty — the goofy serpentine-necked and tonsured imaginary animals, with their distinctly emaciated limbs; the slender, animated trees, even the leaping leering chubby fish and the fluorescent palette; you could tell a Seuss page from anyone else’s right from the start. (He paid a visit to Paris in 1926, at the height of the pictorial, Miró and Klee phase of the Surrealist movement, and seems to have been affected at least by the license it encouraged.) The early successes landed him an apartment on Park Avenue, but it was only during World War II, when he got pulled into the filmmaking unit of the Signal Corps, that, as Jones shows, he began to become a skilled storyteller. A direct subordinate of no less a figure than the director Frank Capra, he was soon put together with the inspired Looney Tunes animator Chuck Jones, another instinctive genius. Geisel later credited Capra and Jones together for showing him the virtues of crispness and “conciseness” in storytelling, ones that his naturally prolix imagination instinctively resisted. He soon invented and drew a wide-eyed character, Private Snafu — the name was a once famous acronym — who became the hero of a series of bizarre “instructional” cartoons. The Geisel-Jones Private Snafu cartoons — you can blessedly see a lot of them on YouTube — make for hallucinatory watching now, since, though drawn and animated in the classic Warner Brothers. style, they are dense with eroticized female pinups, created to appeal to a G.I. audience. Watching them now is like wandering into the forbidden corners of Bugs Bunny’s imagination. Even before the war, Geisel-as-Seuss had won the sponsorship of Bennett Cerf at the new publishing firm Random House, who, in a show of support rare then and almost unknown now, stuck with him through a raft of middling successes in the certainty that Geisel had one big kids’ book in him. Sticking with the “brat market,” though, Jones makes plain, was also a good business plan. In 1953, Phyllis Jackson, Geisel’s literary agent, told him, as Jones recounts it, that “there was something happening in America … there was a middle class blossoming in the suburbs, and they were all having kids.” “The children’s market is building,” Jackson declared, “and you have a reputation.” This enterprise, faltering at first, was set alight the next year by a sudden serendipity. In one of those peculiarly American moments of hand-wringing cultural panic — like the one about video games now, or rap lyrics in the 1980s — pundits in the mid-1950s decided that kids were too drawn to “lurid” comic books instead of dull “school readers,” and therefore failing to learn to read, putting us behind in some Cold War competition or another. John Hersey suggested in a worried piece in Life that children’s writers like Seuss might be the ones to save kids for reading and from the temptation of the comics, and this vague idea soon became a publishing “concept.” Restricted to a 240-word vocabulary, and with the decision to put one picture per page, “The Cat in the Hat” was born. The success of “The Cat in the Hat” — “nothing short of a phenomenon” is how Jones puts it — seemed indeed to counter the lure of the comics. And though one can hardly call Seuss’ work equivalently lurid, it is vulgar in the best, positive sense: bracingly direct and unafraid of silliness, obviously easy to enjoy and always unabashedly fun in the first instance. When “Green Eggs and Ham” was published three years later, it was with an even more restricted word count and even wilder comic effect. As so often happens, awkward discipline produced better art; a limited vocabulary produced a more poignantly memorable poetry and constraints made for cultural advance — or at least for a better-selling children’s book. The underlying drama of “The Cat in the Hat” — the cat’s startling home invasion, taking over the house while Mom is away — is also a reminder that the key to kids’ books is often to combine a fascination with anarchy with a taste for the domestic. Something crazy happens and then it stops, safely. (The real genius of the book is the sudden introduction of Thing One and Thing Two, brought in by the Cat and called nothing more, a bit of meta-humor that seems almost postmodern.) Understanding the calculating sources of Dr. Seuss’ work doesn’t make it less consequential, but it does make it more specific: The note of breezy inconsequence that is part of his books’ charm — until he got so big that he became, it seems, a little frozen, made fretful by his own fame — is, one realizes, partly owing to his not being overinvested in their importance. The absence of obvious moralizing, the catch-as-catch-can prosody, the raggedy serendipity of his long-necked and balding birds and animals turn out to spring from someplace deep in his sly and adaptable personality. Commercial motives can sometimes produce work of superior charm. Geisel was already a middle-aged man when mega-success hit, and his later life, we learn, was largely productive, though marked by a singular catastrophe. His devoted first wife, Helen, who frequently suffered from poor health — including a bout of Guillain-Barré syndrome that left her temporarily paralyzed, and, later, a minor stroke — committed suicide in 1967 by an overdose of drugs. (Geisel, Jones reveals, had been having an affair with a friend’s wife, whom he later married, happily, and the affair may or may not have been causal to Helen’s suicide.) By then he was as much a business as an author, with million-dollar contracts for toys and a series of successful television specials. Fitfully political, he eventually won a Pulitzer Prize in 1984 for a rather obvious anti-nuclear-war allegory called “The Butter Battle Book.” Jones on the whole spends more time on Seuss’ prolific drawing than on his rhyming, a reasonable choice. Geisel was never a painstaking writer of nonsense verse. Lines like “And the Nupboards in the Cupboards. I do like them a lot. But that Nooth Grush on my toothbrush … Well, some are nice but he is not” are easy. Anyone can make rhymes when there are no rules and you get to make up the words; the art of rhyming is in finding actual words in unexpected collisions that resolve in grace. Indeed, Seuss can generally look inelegant compared with his greatest contemporary rivals; place him against Maurice Sendak’s mysterious vision and delicately detailed designs, or Charles Schulz’s sparely drawn, Chekhovian melancholy, and Seuss looks still like a prewar entertainer. Yet it works. Jones’s previous biographies were of Jim Henson and George Lucas, and Geisel seems intuitively a good third to add to the trilogy, or, rather, a foundation for the others. Like the later two men, Geisel was an American master who married shrewd commercial instincts and a weakness for something close to formula with a genuinely overflowing and companionate visual style. It wasn’t a bad imagination — indeed, it was a great one; call him Thing Number One! — for America to have made.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Convent’ Review: Twisted Sisters,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The director Paul Hyett, who has a lengthy résumé in special makeup effects, appears to have a particular affinity for eyeballs. In “The Convent,” so many of these are gouged, popped or singed that it’s easy to lose count — especially in a movie whose murky plot and even murkier lighting puts a considerable strain on our own. Yet this nasty-nunnery tale (originally titled “Heretiks”) has more problems than bleeding peepers. Set in 17th-century England, it centers on Persephone (Hannah Arterton), an accused witch who’s rescued from the bonfire by the forbidding Reverend Mother of a secluded priory. There, Persephone joins a fearful group of virtually enslaved young women beset by a creeping sickness and strange visions. A malevolent entity (whose history is sketched in a brief prologue) is spotted scrabbling on the walls and generally skulking about, though any attempt to investigate is met by the back of the Reverend Mother’s hand. Juggling themes of atonement, exploitation and religious skepticism — one character remarks that the nuns won’t last long because of “a greater infection than their faith” — Hyett proves more successful with atmosphere than plot. Conjuring a dank, grimy-gray palette that’s coldly oppressive, he and his cinematographer, Neil Oseman, fail to elucidate a bewildering jumble of real-world evils (hunger, physical abuse) and otherworldly threats (premonitions, demonic possession) that never come close to cohering. Despite the generous and often nonsensical dollops of gore, “The Convent,” by directly referencing the Church’s past mistreatment of desperate young women, can seem closer in spirit to “The Magdalene Sisters” (2002) than to outright horror. Though that film had more than enough horrors of its own. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Fall of the American Empire’ Review: A Satirical Take on the Crime Story,"Critics’ Pick A philosopher faces a dilemma in Denys Arcand’s film packed with pointed social and political commentary. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In the opening scene of “The Fall of the American Empire,” written and directed by the veteran French-Canadian filmmaker Denys Arcand, a young philosopher Pierre Paul (Alexandre Landry) waxes indignant to his bank-teller girlfriend, Linda (Florence Longpré), about how intelligence has nothing to do with success. Chief executives rise to the top because they sell untruths persuasively. What about successful intellectuals, Linda asks. They were idiots too, he insists, pointing out the personal failings of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. She tells him, “63 million Americans voted for Donald Trump.” He pouts back, “Imbeciles worship cretins.” The lunch doesn’t end well. But afterward, Pierre Paul, who works as a package delivery man, stumbles onto a robbery in which millions are almost literally dropped in his lap. And this man who gives generously to the homeless and volunteers at a soup kitchen decides to make something of his ill-gotten gains. He’s read Tolstoy and others, so he should know this sort of thing hardly ever works out. But with the help of a former biker gang leader with a knack for finance (Rémy Girard) and an escort with a heart of you know what (Maripier Morin), he’s going to give it his best shot. With its galloping pace and strange criminal bedfellows, this funny and engrossing film sometimes feels like the droll capers of the Ealing studio (maker of “The Lavender Hill Mob” among other small classics). But Arcand packs in a lot of pointed social and political commentary. Including a demonstration of how, when you want to commit a really complicated crime, you are best off seeking capitalism itself as an ends to accomplish it — entirely legally.

2019,‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Comes Home to Boston. As an Opera.,"BOSTON — When Margaret Atwood began her novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” with the line “We slept in what had once been the gymnasium,” she may well have been referring to the Lavietes Pavilion here. After all, the dystopian story abounds with references to Boston and neighboring Cambridge, and suggests a Harvard University — Lavietes, its basketball arena, included — repurposed for the militaristic theocracy of Gilead. Boston Lyric Opera is running with that possibility. For its new production of the Danish composer Poul Ruders’s unsettling and complex 2000 adaptation of the novel, the company opted for something site-specific. The gym was available, and for the first time the opera will be staged in the city where it takes place. This is a happy coincidence for Boston Lyric Opera, which has been nomadic while it searches for a permanent home. (The company ended its relationship with its longtime space, the Citi Performing Arts Center Shubert Theater, in 2015.) But that doesn’t mean staging an opera in a basketball arena is without its challenges. The acoustics, to start, can be a nightmare. And converting the basketball court involves effectively building a theater from the ground up. Then there’s the Ruders opera itself: a dense and difficult score with one of the most taxing mezzo-soprano roles in the repertory. (She spends nearly all of the work’s two-and-a-half-hour running time onstage.) “There’s no comparison,” Jennifer Johnson Cano, the mezzo singing the title role of Offred, said after a recent rehearsal. “This is more challenging than Verdi and Wagner. I’ve done Elvira and Carmen. This beats all of them.” But despite the opera’s demands — in addition to its leading role’s endurance test, the work also calls for a large orchestra and cast — it is having a resurgence, thanks in large part to the popularity of Hulu’s television adaptation of the novel, the #MeToo movement and the ever more urgent conversation around climate change. “Any producer wants to have a thermometer on the zeitgeist,” said Esther Nelson, Boston Lyric Opera’s artistic director, who, as it happens, made a small appearance in the 1990 film adaptation. “This is the time to do ‘The Handmaid’s Tale.’” Ms. Nelson and the company are ahead of the curve but will soon be joined by others. Mr. Ruders — whose new opera, “The Thirteenth Child,” will be given its premiere at Santa Fe Opera this summer — said that productions were in development in Copenhagen and San Francisco. “This is certainly a happy thing for a composer,” he added, acknowledging that “The Handmaid’s Tale” has received an unusual number of productions for a contemporary opera, including an acclaimed American premiere in Minneapolis 15 years ago. He began work on it in the mid-1990s with the blessing of Ms. Atwood, who, he recalled, agreed to the adaptation as long as she didn’t have to be involved with it. (She will be in Boston on Saturday to talk about the opera with Mr. Ruders at WBUR CitySpace.) His librettist was the British actor and writer Paul Bentley, later known for playing the High Septon on “Game of Thrones”; they collaborated by phone and fax. The opera, miraculously, loses little of the novel’s plot and themes. The book moves fluidly among three time periods: before Gilead; Offred’s training as a handmaid; and her present. So does the opera, with the casual abandon of a film script — rare for an art form typically limited to a handful of set changes, not more than three dozen. And while the libretto’s language can be frenetic and wordy, its structure is calculated in symmetries between the two acts. The music of the past is carefree and bright; “Amazing Grace” becomes a motif of irony and hypocrisy; the vocal range of Offred, pointedly a mezzo-soprano and not a soprano to emphasize that she is a slave and not a heroine, is narrow and introverted, allowed to soar only in her most private moments. Working with David Angus, Boston Lyric Opera’s music director and the conductor of this “Handmaid’s Tale,” Mr. Ruders has created a new edition of the score that slightly reduces the orchestration and makes it more manageable for smaller companies. The libretto, however, remains as difficult to stage as ever. The veteran director Anne Bogart, who casually dropped references to the filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder and the writer Italo Calvino while explaining her approach to “The Handmaid’s Tale,” is treating the opera as something like a memory play. She said she envisioned her staging as the experience of wearing virtual reality goggles: The set changes depending on Offred’s perspective, which is, as Ms. Johnson Cano said, “a continuous stream.” Anything not currently on Offred’s mind or in her line of sight simply disappears. That means a lot of set pieces are on wheels, coming and going from a backstage that essentially doesn’t exist. But a large staff has worked to make the arena as much like a theater as possible. Some things are surprisingly easy: The locker rooms don’t require much to become dressing rooms. And, as every team has a coach in need of an office, so, too, does an orchestra have a maestro. Carl Rosenberg, an acoustician, has been working on the space, aiming to strike a balance between reflective and absorptive surfaces. But everything he does is ultimately speculative: The results won’t be known until the room has an audience. What he most wants to avoid, he said, is a dead sound for the voices. If no one can hear Offred, there’s no opera. As Ms. Bogart said, “The Handmaid’s Tale” occupies a big world, but it’s really the journey of just one person. “It’s the human heartbeat at the center of this,” she said, “that makes you care.” The Handmaid’s Tale Sunday through May 12 at the Lavietes Pavilion, Boston; blo.org.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Hills’ Made Reality TV What It Is. Now It’s Back.,"Feature Catch up with Brody, Heidi and (most of) the rest — plus, somehow, Mischa Barton? Kaitlynn Carter Jenner, Mischa Barton and Jennifer Delgado filming a scene for “The Hills: New Beginnings” in December.CreditCreditIlona Szwarc for The New York Times It was a sleepy Tuesday in Santa Barbara, just before the new year, when a bunch of people who were once on a popular reality show swept into town. Their first stop was a winery nearby. They walked in, and then they walked out, and then they walked in again. Then they fought like children over whose seat was whose. “I was always sitting here,” said Stephanie Pratt, the sister of the show’s villain, Spencer Pratt. “Are you crazy?” said Justin (Bobby) Brescia, a former hairstylist for the band Maroon 5 and the show’s toxic bachelor. “You’re sitting here.” “No, you’re sitting there,” Stephanie said. “I’m sitting next to Jason,” Justin said. “Fine,” Stephanie said. “If it’s so important to you, you can sit there.” “Thank you. Perfect spot.” At a table some 50 yards away, Lauren Weber, the showrunner of “The Hills: New Beginnings,” was listening on a headset and sighing. Though she had instructed the cast where to sit, she did not expect them to ruin the shot by discussing it on camera. “O.K., have her do it again, since she boned this entire shot — on the arrival,” she said, speaking with the lilt of a reluctant babysitter. And so they walked in a third time. Then they took a break. “Can everyone go pee now?” Spencer asked. Weber allowed it. They’d been driving for more than an hour. Everyone’s headsets went dead. “They pod down during bathroom breaks,” Weber explained. “There’s some stuff we don’t need to hear.” After a field producer shepherded five adults, one at a time, into a bathroom inside the winery, the cameras finally rolled. Heidi Montag, Spencer’s wife, seemed to speak for everyone when she said, “Yay, guys — we made it!” The original “Hills” premiered in 2006 as a spinoff of MTV’s high school “docu-soap” “Laguna Beach.” The show followed a group of young people in Los Angeles. They had disappointing boyfriends and sort-of-real jobs that seemed different from their parents’ 9-to-5s. They were fashion interns and club promoters and music-label scouts (on the digital side). They learned to live on camera. Eventually they became “brands.” The show, meanwhile, marked the dawn of the sort of glossy programming that would later subsume networks like E! and Bravo. The aspirational L.A. settings, the ensemble cast connected via nebulous lifestyle choices, the sweeping aerial shots with light bouncing off glass facades, the deadpan looks in place of normal human emotion — “The Hills” invented this. A popular thing to say about reality TV, especially by people who have never seen it, is that it isn’t really real. Few shows played with this idea better than “The Hills.” Epic swells of music signaled narrative cues. The voice-over gave it a single heroine. Producers plotted much of the story. Part of the thrill was that you never could tell what was real. In the 2010 series finale, MTV let viewers in on the joke. As Brody Jenner, the show’s male protagonist, stood with the Hollywood sign behind him, watching his love interest drive off into the sunset, the backdrop was suddenly wheeled away, revealing that they were in fact on a movie lot. The car never even left. In the series’s wake, a net of tangential fame spread across the actual hills of Los Angeles. If you’ve never heard of Brody Jenner, then you may know his extended family members. “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” had its premiere a year after “The Hills,” following Brody’s stepsister Kim, then sidekick to Paris Hilton. Brody’s father, Bruce Jenner, had married Kim’s mother, Kris, and Brody made cameos to babysit their then pretween daughters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner. Meanwhile, Brody’s mother, Linda Thompson, a former Miss Tennessee and girlfriend of Elvis (the fat period), married and divorced David Foster, the musician and producer who would then appear on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” as stepdad to Gigi and Bella Hadid, now among fashion’s biggest models. Bruce and Kris Jenner would eventually divorce, too, and Bruce would become Caitlyn, getting her own show, “I Am Cait.” [Read about Andy Cohen and the “Real Housewives” franchise.] In a way, the return of “The Hills” is the merry-go-round coming full circle. Since it has been off the air, Pamela Anderson — she who paved the sex-tape way for Paris and Kim’s reality careers — has twice married and divorced the guy holding the camera in Paris’s sex tape, while Brandon, Pamela’s eldest son, has come of age just in time to be tapped to appear on “The Hills: New Beginnings” by none other than his good pal Brody Jenner. By now, you may be pretending you don’t know any of this, but you do, at least some of it, the same way we all know it, which is that your brain has adapted to the new millennium by functioning like one of those Roomba vacuums — just passively sweeping up information, hoping its human will come home and dislodge it from beneath the sofa. “Spencer made ‘The Hills’ come back,” Heidi told me. (Nina L. Diaz, MTV’s president of entertainment: “We’d already been thinking about it.”) After the show ended, Spencer was depressed. For years, he called his former co-stars and MTV, pitching a reboot. But then came the endless TV remakes (“Roseanne,” “Will & Grace,” “Twin Peaks”), and even reality executives turned to that precious IP. After the “Jersey Shore” reboot became MTV’s most watched show of 2018, the network decided to resurrect “The Hills,” which will have its premiere on June 24. But this time the cast would be, in Diaz’s words, “newly divorced, newly wed, newly sober.” Lauren Conrad, the original show’s lead, declined to return, so in a real mind-bendy plot twist, MTV replaced her with Mischa Barton, the star of the 2003 Fox show “The O.C.,” which inspired “Laguna Beach,” which inspired “The Hills.” Except “The O.C.” was a scripted show, in which Mischa, an actress born in London and raised in New York, played a sun-kissed teenager from Orange County. Depositing Mischa into “The Hills” today is like having Julia Roberts join a reality show about call girls. It’s the sort of thing that only makes sense in dreams — and Hollywood. Since “The O.C.,” Mischa’s life had taken the familiar course of a child star: There were a few hospitalizations, a “Dr. Phil” appearance and a lawsuit against her mother. “She spoke to the themes we were exploring,” Weber, the showrunner, told me. “Which was kind of brushing yourself off after you’ve been beat up by Hollywood at a young age. They all can relate to that.” [Read more about Mischa Barton’s post-“O.C.” life.] The day’s shoot was in Los Olivos, mere miles from Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch. Technically, everyone had aged a decade, but I couldn’t tell. They all still looked tan and sparkly-eyed. If anything, they seemed like more potent versions of themselves, like stock that had been left to simmer, or in this case adults who were still playing characters they created at 22. Spencer was brawnier. Stephanie’s skin was so lustrous that she seemed to be molded out of Barbie-grade thermoplastic. Justin Bobby had gone full Johnny Depp — chin-length hair, a goatee-mustache combo, a blooming rose tattooed on his left hand. He’d brought a new lady friend but was still playing the world’s most unavailable boyfriend. Asked if they were “official,” he stuttered: “I think it’s still very ... I just haven’t like ... it just hasn’t, like ...” Weber was all over that. “Can we get a reaction as Justin weasels away?” Weber is the show’s omniscient, Godlike figure, manning the control room in ankle boots and a leather jacket, but she’s also a little like Puck, that quick-witted, meddling fairy, always perched somewhere just out of frame, watching the players, whispering in their ears, amused by their human foibles. At one point, watching Justin, she said: “He’s always so pensive, that Justin. What are you thinking about, Justin?” The original series aired shortly after Weber moved to Los Angeles from Ohio, and she still talked like a fan. “I think he’s uncomfortable because this girl is taking it real fast,” she finally said. Santa Barbara was to serve as the setting for Heidi and Spencer’s wedding-vow renewal. The weekend would culminate with Heidi performing her new Christian single, which is exactly what it sounds like. While everyone was still arriving, the winery crew would get boozy and stir some drama, most of which had to do with Brody and his new wife, Kaitlynn Carter Jenner — not to be confused with Caitlyn Jenner, his father. Brody and Spencer used to be best friends, but since “The Hills” ended, their friendship had soured. Brody didn’t even invite Spencer to his wedding in Indonesia. There was a lot of talk about Brody’s “lifestyle,” which turned out to be code for what Stephanie called his “famous open marriage.” [Read about ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race.] Justin’s slipperiness was just a B-story. The real story was coming, and Weber already knew what it was. Unlike her predecessors on the original, Weber doesn’t script the episodes. She might tell the cast where to sit, but she never tells them what to say unless it’s something they want to say, then she just helps them get there. (“We try to bring forth what they’re thinking,” she told me.) “Spencer is about to say something, and it’s going to be to Jason and Ashley,” Weber said. Just then, Spencer launched the sort of hollow missile that gives reality episodes their engine. After revealing that Kaitlynn had called everyone fake, he turned to Jason, a newly sober member of the original cast, and his wife, Ashley. “Obviously I don’t feel this way,” he said, “but she feels you two are too trashy to hang out with.” And just like that, the episode’s seeds were planted. Jason and Ashley vowed to confront Kaitlynn that very night. Weber rubbed her hands together. It was chilly, but the gesture was also very puckish. She called out to her crew. “Let’s get some exits, and then let’s ice them!” It used to be that if producers missed a “real” moment, it would be re-enacted for the cameras, giving first-generation reality TV that stunted quality of bad acting. Now the cast is often isolated between scenes so that nothing is lost. While Weber advanced to the next location, some were “iced,” while others traveled with GoPro cameras to “maximize reality,” as she put it. In Santa Barbara, MTV had rented an oceanfront villa, which sat on a sprawling property with a pool, a fire pit and private beach access. “It’s like a Nancy Meyers set,” Weber said. Brody was hanging in the backyard with Brandon Lee, eating tacos. Last year, Brandon was in the tabloids for physically assaulting his father, Tommy Lee, the Mötley Crüe drummer. Their reconciliation would be part of his arc. He told Brody he’d invited his dad to a Chargers game, but his dad was away with his fiancée. “He obviously made plans before we reconnected,” Brandon reasoned. The production team was camped out in the driveway. Weber watched the cast on six screens, as if peering inside the rooms of a dollhouse. Brandon and Brody were in one. In another, Mischa was chatting with Kaitlynn, who turned out to have her own beef with Ashley, after Ashley (apparently) said that Kaitlynn and Brody shouldn’t have kids because of their open marriage. “She needs to learn to mind her own business,” Kaitlynn said. “She works at a hair salon,” Mischa replied. “Those people weigh in on everything.” This got a hearty laugh in the control room. (Weber: “That was so shady!”) Mischa’s story line would include her relationship with her mother. “It was better for a minute, but then it got bad again,” she told Kaitlynn. “I’m a strong individual when it comes to that stuff — I am. I had to learn to be.” Kaitlynn continued to overexplain her marriage. She said, “A couple’s sex life has nothing to do with whether they should have kids.” And: “Everything that’s happened in our relationship is a decision we came to together.” And: “It’s equally to my benefit as much as Brody’s. I used to always get bored in relationships, and now I don’t.” On another screen, while his wife tirelessly defended their union, Brody was discussing the menu at McDonald’s. “The McGriddle?” he said to Brandon. “I’m sure I’ve had that, bro.” This whole time, Jason and Ashley were being iced in the driveway. Ashley’s confrontation with Kaitlynn had to be timed just right. The director counted them in like a rocket launch. “And three, two, one — send in Jason and Ashley.” On the old “Hills,” such scenes were heavily staged to amplify drama. Spencer recalled that after Snooki Polizzi was punched on “Jersey Shore,” a producer suggested that he “do the Snooki thing” with his sister to boost ratings. “I was like, ‘Did you just joke about me punching my sister?’ ” Spencer said. Somewhere along the quest for fact meets fiction, Heidi and Spencer — collectively known as Speidi — lost the plot. Heidi, once a bubbly 17-year-old from Colorado, had 10 cosmetic operations in a single day. Spencer spent millions on healing crystals and was reported to have physically threatened a producer. By the series finale, they were booted off the show. “New Beginnings” is the work of a different production company, appropriately called Evolution Media. The show is shot like a moving documentary, and the cast will be able to weigh in via traditional interviews. (“It’s their story this time around,” Nina Diaz told me.) In the last decade, reality TV has become so very real that it has gone all postmodern. On “The Kardashians,” a crew member once entered the shot to help Kim take a selfie when her carpal tunnel was acting up; on “Vanderpump Rules,” a “Real Housewives” spinoff, a producer’s voice is often left in during interviews. On “New Beginnings,” for now, the fourth wall remains very much intact. When Mischa joined “The Hills,” Spencer imagined a more experimental version of the show. “I thought we were going to make like a Netflix documentary-style ‘Hills,’ where you would see cameras, and it would be like ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm,’ ” he told me. But the producers still told him not to talk about the show on the show. “And I was like: ‘But we have Mischa Barton from “The O.C.,” what do you mean we can’t talk about the show? Can I talk about “The O.C.”? Like, what?’ ” But keeping things real can also mean tamer plot lines. Ashley’s entrance at the house was ultimately anticlimactic. She and Kaitlynn just kind of glided by each other, avoiding eye contact. Eventually tensions bubbled over, with Brody storming into the backyard, announcing that he and Kaitlynn were leaving. When everyone arrived for the rehearsal dinner, Weber was waiting out front. “She’s heated because I made a comment about her not having a baby because her husband sleeps with her friends!” Ashley said breathlessly. Weber nodded empathetically. She was at once a producer, shrink and coach. “I defer to you,” she said. “But it is their vow renewal, so. ... ” Ashley was listening. “Why don’t you talk about it when you get in there?” Weber continued. “Have some cocktails, and make a decision based on how you want to handle it — as a couple. Sound good?” Ashley and Jason looked at each other. They seemed calmer. “O.K., yeah,” Ashley said. Weber sent them back into the game with the equivalent of an encouraging pat on the bum: “You look gorgeous!” What can I tell you about the rehearsal dinner? Heidi and Kaitlynn talked. Brody and Spencer talked. Ashley said things like, “She thinks I’m saying all this stuff, but I’m just saying what she’s saying, and she’s actually saying stuff about me.” Spencer brought one of Heidi’s backup dancers as a date for Brandon. I heard the director cue in Heidi, then Brody, then the dancer, then the paella. The next day, everyone gathered at the Santa Barbara courthouse for the vow renewal. Heidi wore a white minidress with a sheer overlay. Spencer wore a Lemurian crystal around his neck — for the dispelling of drama. An MTV executive watching over Weber’s shoulder took issue with Mischa’s outfit, an asymmetrical skirt paired with a floral cap-sleeve blouse. “Does it have shoulder pads?” she asked. “What is that? Oh, no. She looks like a linebacker.” Once seated, the cast was asked to sit still so that cameras could capture “beauty shots.” As they held their pose — foreheads glistening, eyes squinting against the afternoon sun — they had the distinct look of people who’d spent the fragile parts of their lives on TV. They seemed simultaneously incapable of neuroses and perpetually self-conscious. The ceremony itself was quick. Afterward, everyone headed back to the house. While Heidi prepared for her performance, Spencer held the couple’s 1-year-old son, Gunner, and discussed his crystal line, Pratt Daddy Crystals. “Before, crystals made me broke, and now, crystals are making me rich,” Spencer said, unfazed by his wife, who was whipping her high ponytail around and lip-syncing to an imaginary microphone in the middle of their bedroom. Brody and Kaitlynn ended up staying. They even promised to invite Spencer should they have an American wedding. Kaitlynn didn’t plan on legally changing her name anyway. “Just because of Brody’s dad. ... ” she said, not finishing the thought. It was time for Heidi’s performance. After thanking everyone for coming, Heidi announced, “I have a little song for you — about Jesus.” As Heidi and her dancers began gyrating, a pulsating pop-club beat came over the speakers, followed by her autotuned voice. The song, called “Glitter and Glory,” was about losing fame and finding God. Some will see their name in neon Think they’ve finally got it made But there always comes a moment When they watch it fade away . . . Don’t want to gain the whole world And lose my soul . . . God help me to see The difference between Glitter and glory-ee-ee Glitter and glory-ee-ee When it was over, it turned out she’d missed a few steps. They did it again.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Hustle’ Review: Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson Hit Their Marks,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Comedy is in a weird place these days. Stand-up performers and late-night television hosts lean into the politics of the moment, while most movies with an urge to be funny tread cautiously, afraid of giving offense to any segment of the audience. “The Hustle” does some of that — it pushes no buttons and tests no boundaries — but in the service of a higher cause. Or maybe a lower one. Silliness is the watchword. Always silliness. Which is not the same as originality. Directed by Chris Addison (it’s his first feature), “The Hustle” closely replicates a movie from 1988 called “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.” Have you seen it? It’s fun, and it was also a remake, as well as the inspiration for a Broadway show. Like “Scoundrels,” which starred Michael Caine, Steve Martin and Glenne Headly, “The Hustle” tells the tale of two rival con artists matching wits against the picturesque backdrop of the French Riviera. Josephine (Anne Hathaway) lives in ill-gotten luxury in the (fictional) village of Beaumont-sur-Mer, assisted by two loyal, scene-stealing confederates (Ingrid Oliver and Nicholas Woodeson) as she schemes to relieve vain, wealthy men of their money. Penny (Rebel Wilson) pursues a similar racket in less refined circumstances, and with less elegant methods. Her go-to grift is a modified version of catfishing, in which she confabulates a hot sister in desperate need of surgery. Her arrival in Beaumont is an irritant to Josephine, who objects to the competition and also to Penny’s exuberant vulgarity. Their frenemyship evolves through several stages. Josephine offers her services as mentor, hoping to polish Penny’s rough edges. Then they are competing to see who can fleece an American tech billionaire (Alex Sharp) who barely looks old enough to shave but is nonetheless ripe for the plucking. You will probably see the major plot twists coming, but you won’t necessarily enjoy what happens any less. Soignée swindlers in an opulent Mediterranean setting are pretty irresistible, and there’s something reassuring about a story that could have been told, with some variations of tone and topicality, at any point in the last hundred years or so. As with any classic recipe, what matters most is the execution. The financial stakes for Penny and Josephine and their marks may be high, but otherwise “The Hustle” gambles with play money, risking a bit of sentimentality or wounded feelings here, a snarl of meanspiritedness there. Nobody is going to get hurt, but Hathaway and Wilson make decent sport of it. The humor, as you might expect, relies on their physical and temperamental contrasts. Hathaway, affecting an upper-crusty accent as Josephine’s default voice (she has others when she needs them), savors her own chilliness and weaponizes her self-control. Wilson is, well, the opposite — anarchic, profane, warm and obnoxious, using her body like a throw pillow and her voice like a car alarm. Her deployment of the phrase “prima nocta” is a high point. There are others — goofy accents, nicely staged pratfalls, humiliations large and small — though not much that rises to the level of unforgettable, wild-eyed, laugh-out-loud hilarity. But as I said, comedy is in a weird place right now, and “The Hustle” deserves some credit for fulfilling its own modest, escapist ambitions. Unlike a lot of what we see these days, in movies and elsewhere, it doesn’t feel like a rip-off or a scam. It’s downright innocent.

2019,‘The Image You Missed’ Review: From Son to Father and Filmmaker to Filmmaker,"Donal Foreman looks back at the documentaries of his father, Arthur MacCaig, who made films about the Troubles. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At the heart of “The Image You Missed,” an intriguing documentary from Donal Foreman that takes a sidelong look at the Troubles, is a quote that, elsewhere (though not when it’s heard in the movie), is attributed to the Derry activist Paddy Doherty: “An Irishman never speaks to the person in front of him, but to an image.” That’s an apt summation of this essay film’s method. Foreman makes sense of the images left behind by his dead father, Arthur MacCaig, a New Jersey-born Irish-American who settled in Paris and made documentaries about Northern Ireland that showcased the perspectives of Irish nationalists. (The Metrograph, where “The Image You Missed” is opening, is showing some of MacCaig’s movies in a sidebar.) The film is constructed as a dialogue that’s at once son to father (MacCaig was mostly absent from Foreman’s upbringing) and filmmaker to filmmaker. Foreman compares his dad’s way of making documentaries to his own: “You had been able to reach conclusions; my narratives were partial, incomplete, at risk of falling apart at any moment.” Foreman says he envied MacCaig’s assurance, but he also recognizes what his father’s films elide. The men were opposites in more than just their approach to their craft. MacCaig came from the New York area and gravitated to Belfast; Foreman, raised in Dublin by his mother, looked to New York. “The Image You Missed” is less compelling as an act of personal therapy than it is as filmed film criticism, but even if it doesn’t fully cohere, Foreman’s family stake helps keep it original.

2019,‘The Intruder’ Review: Dennis Quaid as a Homeowner’s Nightmare,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Intruder,” a real-estate-based thriller set in California’s Napa Valley, is more silly than scary. This doesn’t seem to be entirely intentional, and it isn’t altogether unwelcome. The idea of Dennis Quaid popping up in your kitchen in the middle of the night might not exactly be the stuff of nightmares. Quaid, playing a deranged ex-homeowner named Charlie Peck, seems to know this. And the director, Deon Taylor, does too. Still, there are a few jolts and a heavy dose of caveat emptor. The emptors are Scott and Annie Howard, a couple from San Francisco who buy Foxglove, a rambling ivy-covered pile that has been in Charlie’s family for generations. Annie (Meagan Good), a writer for women’s magazines, falls in love with the house. Scott (Michael Ealy), a big-shot marketing strategist, isn’t so sure, but an isolated house at the end of a spooky, tree-lined driveway seems like the perfect place to start a family. Charlie couldn’t be more obliging. He shows up to mow the grass, brings pies for Thanksgiving dinner and helps Annie hang Christmas lights. It takes her a comically long time to detect the creepiness in his attentions, given the twitchy, eyeball-rattling derangement that Quaid brings even to Charlie’s quieter moments. Scott figures out what’s going on a little faster, but behaves like enough of a jerk to make Charlie look sympathetic. Eventually things move from creepy to murdery, as everyone in the audience always knew they would. There isn’t a lot going on here. Annie and Scott have exactly two friends (Joseph Sikora and Alvina August), no family to speak of and not much to talk about. There’s a hint of domestic trouble in their background, and a tragedy in Charlie’s that turns out to be something much worse. But David Loughery’s functional script doesn’t spend much time exploring motives or psychological nuances. Scott needs to defend his wife and his property, both of which Charlie regards as rightfully belonging to him. Charlie is white. Scott and Annie are black. Nobody in the film makes the slightest reference to race, which has the effect of turning it into a subtext — an undropped shoe in a room full of people pretending to walk around barefoot. In much the same way that it’s not about race, “The Intruder” is not about politics, which is to say that there’s a suggestive little allegory tucked into its by-the-numbers plot. Charlie is a guy with a lot of guns who favors red baseball caps. He may have sold his house to the Howards, but he doesn’t quite accept that it’s theirs. When they replace a piece of art on the living room wall with something more to their taste, he’s nearly apoplectic with rage. He wants to take the place back and make it great again, even though it emerges that he messed everything up in the first place, including his marriage and his business. He just can’t accept change, and he’d rather destroy the house than let someone new live in it. Like I said: more silly than scary. Unless it’s the other way around.

2019,‘The Perfection’ Review: A Thriller in the Key of Crazy,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Like the classical music its subjects perform so elegantly, Richard Shepard’s “The Perfection,” now on Netflix, plays out as a series of movements, indulging in extreme shifts of key and tempo from one section to the next: For long stretches of time, it seems to be one kind of movie, and then, in a blink, it is something else entirely. The film begins as something like a drama. Charlotte (Allison Williams) is a former cello prodigy who stepped away from her vaunted post at “the premier private music facility for young cellists,” which is run with an iron fist by Anton (Steven Weber) and Paloma (Alaina Huffman), in order to care for her sick mother. In the ensuing decade, Lizzie (Logan Browning) has become the school’s star pupil. Charlotte and Lizzie meet in Shanghai, where they’ve been invited to serve as judges in selecting Anton’s next live-in student. A “Black Swan” dynamic quickly begins to develop between them, in which Charlotte seems threatened but aroused by this younger prodigy. Their chemistry is electric, dramatized by a cello duet sequence that is shot and edited like a sex scene before slowly becoming one. (The editor, David Dean, does some of the best intercutting this side of “Out of Sight.”) [“The Perfection” filmmakers explain their thought process.] Then comes the second movement, and with it, an unexpected, hard-left turn into straight-up body horror. The two young women, still abuzz from their night together, decide to take a day trip on a rickety bus through the Chinese countryside, even though Lizzie is starting to feel a little sick. Just a hangover, right? Yet her illness escalates as they get farther from civilization, and Shepard builds a thick haze of dread around them, waiting out this uncomfortable, escalating situation and the build of her horrifying sickness. If they can’t escape that bus, the logic seems to go, then neither can we. And then … well, that’s when things start to get really interesting. More than that is best left unsaid, as “The Perfection” pulls a daring second-act reframing that amounts to a full-siren announcement that all bets are off. What’s striking is how fluidly Shepard moves from one perspective to the next, swapping heroes and villains, upending assumptions. And the meticulousness of the taut and airtight screenplay, written by Shepard with Eric C. Charmelo and Nicole Snyder, means that what first appear to be loose ends are never left dangling long. Williams is an ideal lead for such narrative sleights of hand. As in “Get Out,” the picture benefits from her particular skill at hiding her secrets, of putting on a brave face or a sincere voice without giving away her real game. Browning (known for taking over the Tessa Thompson role in the Netflix adaptation of “Dear White People”) is a revelation as Lizzie, bringing a scary vulnerability to the role and deftly transforming it into strength. And Weber is a standout in support, his scarf arranged over his tweed jacket just so, a character whose theatricality can clearly swing, on a dime, into madness. Some of the effects are not for wobbly stomachs, including one moment of gore that rivals Netflix’s gold standard, “Gerald’s Game,” and later sections skate into territory that may prove too dark (or perhaps too exploitative) for some audiences. A few moments are rather on the nose (one scene has Weber unnerved when his stereo switches from classical to hip-hop, so uncivilized), and some of the early exposition leans on the kind of clumsy, conveniently overheard conversations that should have been jettisoned in the second draft. The tone also proves difficult to sustain: Material like this walks a tightrope over silliness, and Shepard occasionally loses his balance. But he recovers. Shepard is a peculiar filmmaker, whose jazzy 2005 feature “The Matador” might have been a breakthrough had it found the audience it deserved, and who has mostly floundered in subsequent film efforts. His execution here is often giddily trashy — wild strings and creaky doors on the soundtrack, lingering knife close-ups filling the frame — but it doesn’t feel like slumming. This is a filmmaker aware of the conventions, who wields them with wit and precision and knows his audience is on the gag as well. In many ways, “The Perfection” amounts to little more than a bag of tricks. But no one is pretending otherwise. And they’re good tricks.

2019,"‘The Phantom Menace’ Wasn’t Great, but Its Force Still Runs Strong","Critic’s Notebook Maybe you waited in line all night for tickets. Maybe you took your kid out of school. Maybe you sat through the somnambulant three-hour Brad Pitt movie “Meet Joe Black” six months earlier, just to see the first trailer. But even if you were a casual fan in 1999, you surely felt goose bumps when the lights went down and “The Phantom Menace,” the first “Star Wars” adventure after 16 years of rumors and anticipation, was finally unveiled. It took only 55 seconds for the disappointment to set in. First there was the full 20th Century Fox fanfare, leading into the glittering emerald of the Lucasfilm logo. Then a silent fade to black and “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” a phrase that so perfectly evokes storytelling tradition while suggesting the infinite. And finally, that familiar burst of brass and percussion that opens the theme music by John Williams, welcoming the titles and the opening crawl, and a prequel trilogy that will bring a new generation of fans into the “Star Wars” family. “Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic.” Yes! Turmoil! The pretext to all interstellar conflict! “The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute.” A sudden drop in cabin pressure. Who opened the air lock? To be fair to George Lucas, the creator of “Star Wars” and the writer-director of “Phantom,” which has its 20th anniversary on Sunday, nations have gone to war over less than taxation. Lucas has always been a politically minded filmmaker — he was involved in the early stages of “Apocalypse Now,” which he intended to direct — and perhaps he wanted to suggest that mass tragedy is often rooted in the banal. Policy divisions that put you to sleep can also kill you. It was also the first indication that maybe “Phantom” was not the event it was cracked up to be. That maybe a lack of creative urgency explained all the time that had passed since the original “Star Wars” trilogy ended. And yet, the critical disappointment from that time has slowly receded as Hollywood has built on Lucas’s achievements. Without “Phantom” and its sequels, the complex integration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe may not have been possible — to say nothing of the screen-saver gloss of its celestial destinations. All the weaknesses that plagued “The Phantom Menace” 20 years ago are still readily apparent in 2019: the actors stiffened by dialogue that must have sounded snappier in its original Huttese; the nonaction scenes that alternately appeal to the very young or to grown-ups stuck in meetings all day; the midi-chlorians. And then there was Jar Jar Binks, the notorious floppy-eared Gungan whom Lucas intended as comic relief but who spoke and behaved like an amalgam of bad racial stereotypes — “a Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit,” as the Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern described him. (Lucas has fervently defended his maligned creation as recently as April, when he called Jar Jar his favorite “Star Wars” character.) And the stereotypes didn’t stop with Jar Jar; multiple characters wouldn’t survive the scrutiny of today’s culture pages. In an outrageous riff on geek entitlement, the stand-up comedian Patton Oswalt fantasized in his 2007 album, “Werewolves and Lollipops,” about using a time machine — not to find out who Jack the Ripper was or to stop the Kennedy assassination but to kill Lucas with a shovel, preventing him from making the prequels. We don’t need to know what Darth Vader or Boba Fett were like as kids (sad), or what the Death Star looked like when it was under construction (a hamster wheel), he argued. Oswalt likened it to having Lucas offer a dish of ice cream and then handing a big bag of rock salt instead. I don’t care where “the stuff I love comes from!” he screamed.“I just love the stuff I love!” And yet the legacy of “The Phantom Menace” strangely redounds to Lucas’s favor, setting the tone for the big movie franchises of today. The Marvel and DC universes, for example, are full of Easter eggs and other incidental details that are less about moving the story forward than about adding dimension for its own sake. The current “Star Wars” trilogy and spinoffs, of course, are too: Learning how Han Solo got his name in “Solo: A Star Wars Story” has no dramatic value. It’s just a piece of trivia, another collectible to put on the virtual shelf. Lucas’s obsession with world-building in “The Phantom Menace” proved a more lasting contribution to film and television in the 21st century than it might have seemed at the time. The city center of Naboo is an ancient dream of civilization realized in peaceful symmetry, with great domes carved into natural wonders. The Gungans retreat to an underwater Atlantis of ornamental bubbles. The Galactic Senate is rendered as a sea of pods around a cavernous rotunda — and, is an ineffectual check on a tyrant’s push for war. Computer-generated imagery had been coming of age in the mid- to late 1990s, but no single film had used C.G.I. to such sustained or varied effect, or so seamlessly brought digital creations into contact with flesh-and-blood humans. When Roger Ebert sighed, “How quickly we grow accustomed to wonders” in response to the film’s critics, he had a point. We’d never seen anything like it before. Adults who grew up loving the original “Star Wars” trilogy may have groaned in disappointment, but for their kids, “Phantom” was the start of their “Star Wars” trilogy. And people packed the theaters regardless: “Phantom” grossed nearly $1 billion worldwide, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com, (the 2012 3-D release pushed it beyond $1 billion), and the sequels were wildly popular. A debut this anticipated was expected to break opening-weekend records (it topped $28 million on opening day, a record then for single-day returns), but its overall earnings belied the notion that audiences were completely crestfallen. The culture shifted accordingly. Franchises like the “Harry Potter” and Marvel movies, or even the “Fast and the Furious” series, are talked about now in terms of “mythology” — not as mere sequels but as densely connected epics of ever-ballooning scale. Pour enough detail into the work, as Lucas did, and it will take root in the popular imagination. The tragedy of George Lucas is that he was ultimately rejected from the world he created. “Phantom” had reaffirmed the durability of the franchise, Jar Jar be damned, but its flaws were enough to make fans and studios start to dream about a “Star Wars” without Lucas — to question whether projects on that scale were worth ever risking on a single person’s vision. And by the end of the prequel trilogy, he had inadvertently created a universe so precise that others could take the blueprint and make their own box-office Death Star. Once Disney bought the franchise in 2012, a phalanx of writers and directors could be deployed to make whatever small modifications were needed to spruce it up — better performances and dialogue, perhaps, or increased diversity. Lucas’s idiosyncrasies could be buffed out. Now the series has gotten so conservative that even the gentle tweaking of expectations in “The Last Jedi” is treated in some corners as an unforgivable heresy. Lucas financed “Phantom” entirely outside the Hollywood system, and at the time it was a joke to hear it referred to as the most expensive indie film ever made. But he also wrote and directed it, and all of its marvels and shortcomings can be credited wholly to him — vanishingly rare in a more producer-driven, machine-tooled Hollywood. Twenty years ago, no one could have anticipated that Lucas would be the last of the blockbuster iconoclasts.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Professor’ Review: The Lessons He Learns Along the Way,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At the start of “The Professor,” a glib portrait about a dying academic, the title character, Richard (Johnny Depp), receives a diagnosis of stage-four lung cancer; without treatment, he has probably six months to live. His plan to tell his family is upstaged after, in a single evening at the dinner table, his daughter (Odessa Young) comes out and his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) reveals that she’s having an affair with his university’s chancellor (Ron Livingston). So he keeps the news to himself. And the cancer, far from debilitating him (too much), transforms Richard into a free man. He drives around with shades on and his dog on his lap. He smokes a cigarette — he wasn’t a smoker before — and experiments sexually. To his students, he becomes a mad prophet, dismissing any members of the class who aren’t truly interested in literature and fashioning himself into an unhinged “Dead Poets Society” figure for the rest. (“Do not give into mediocrity like the other 98 percent of the world,” he advises his students, with whom he also smokes pot and drinks.) The writer-director Wayne Roberts complements this tired (at best) depiction of cancer as a liberating force with equally worn-out screenwriting devices, as when Richard lets loose in a mortifying toast at a formal dinner near the end. Depp’s turbocharged archness is basically the whole show. The actor appears as out of whits to give as the man he’s playing, with little interest in enunciating clearly or hiding his self-regard. His mugging can be fun to watch, but he is hardly convincing as a dying man.

Detailing at once an art project and a rescue mission, a love triangle and an elaborate, outlandish bargain, the movie has a surface serenity that belies its fuming emotions. In this, it mirrors the three-year correspondence between Magid (a writer and artist who once trained as a spy), and the controller of the archives, Federica Zanco. Rumored to have acquired them in the mid-1990s as an engagement gift from her fiancé, the owner of a Swiss design conglomerate, Zanco rigidly guards them from all but limited public access in her foundation near Basel. Faced with major obstacles to mounting her own exhibition on Barragán (who died in 1988), Magid embarks on an epistolary seduction of increasing flattery and desperation. As Magid putters around Barragán’s Mexico City studio, researching and plotting and painting her toenails, her voice-over pleas to Zanco — and the creamily polite rebuffs — turn the movie into a delicate duel between two women armed with obsessions for the same man. They will finally meet in a Swiss cafe, filmed hazily through a window (Jarred Alterman’s cinematography is consistently dreamy); yet Zanco’s romantically fuzzy aspect is fitting in a film that feels only tangentially concerned with corporate control of art. Culminating in a brilliantly appropriate stunt (labeled a “ghoulish plot” by one news outlet), “The Proposal” meditates on the meaning of artistic legacy and hums with the fear of being wiped from public memory. Most of all, it shines an ingeniously media-savvy spotlight on Barragán’s work — and, not incidentally, on that of the filmmaker herself.

2019,Opinion | ‘The Right Has a Greater Appreciation of Labor’s Role Than We Do’,"Can Democrats figure out how to get unions back into the equation in 2020? Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. Even as many Democrats appear to accept organized labor’s decline, Republicans recognize the crucial importance of unions and are determined to gut them further. The conservative who may understand labor’s ongoing significance best is Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. In a 2017 essay for OZY.com, “Why Republicans (and Trump) May Still Win Big in 2020 — Despite ‘Everything’,” Norquist, a longtime anti-tax, anti-labor activist, argued that continuing the right-wing’s effort to crush labor’s power will be of vital importance to the outcome of the next election: Trump’s unexpected victory in 2016 did not lay the groundwork for Republican political dominance. But the March 2011 signing of ACT 10, a dramatic reform of public sector labor laws, by Wisconsin’s Scott Walker certainly did. To understate it: If Act 10 is enacted in a dozen more states, the modern Democratic Party will cease to be a competitive power in American politics. It’s that big a deal. Wisconsin Act 10 — the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill — was a bill proposed by Scott Walker, the former Republican governor, and passed in 2011 by the Wisconsin Legislature. The act, as described by the liberal Center for American Progress, was brutal and laid waste to public-sector unions in Wisconsin: Act 10 reduced collective bargaining rights for most state and municipal employees, including K-12 teachers. The law also weakened unions by mandating annual recertification elections and prohibiting paycheck deductions for dues collection. It also eliminated teachers’ and other public employees’ rights to bargain over hours and conditions of employment, as well as their ability to bargain over any compensation beyond base pay. Act 10 further restricted this base-pay bargaining by limiting increases to annual inflation. Norquist’s claim about the effectiveness of Act 10 is spot on. The relentless Republican assault on unions in the industrial belt states during the first half of this decade was an unquestionable success, politically speaking. It resulted in decreased Democratic turnout, a crucial drop in the bankrolling of Democratic candidates and, more subtly but no less significantly, a debilitating sense of powerlessness among union members. Jon Shelton, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin — Green Bay, who has studied the effects of labor law changes in the state, wrote me by email: Long story short, union membership has stabilized, but the consequences have been severe. One of the things that is hard to capture — beyond the economics — is how much public employees now feel disempowered. Shelton cited Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing the virtual collapse of organized labor in Wisconsin. Members of unions as a percentage of employment in Wisconsin and nationally. Wisconsin 15.0 15% 12.4 United States 10.5 10% 8.1 Act 10 became law in 2011 5% 2008 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 Wisconsin 15.0 15% 12.4 United States 10.5 10% 8.1 Act 10 became law in 2011 5% 2008 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 By The New York Times | Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics The success of the concerted attacks by right-wing groups on the labor movement, especially on public employee unions, reflects more than the failure of Democrats at the national level to take steps to protect the rights of unions. First, the attacks exposed the union movement’s lack of preparedness for the battle, despite the clear warnings from conservative groups. Second, they revealed the long-term neglect, by Democratic and liberal donors, of politics at the state and local level, where key labor laws are enacted. Third, they showed the dangerously high level of public employee union dependence on favorable government treatment for survival. This dependency left these unions vulnerable when Republicans took over many state governments in the wave elections of 2010 and 2014. There is some evidence that unions are regrouping. But they do so from a weakened position, with fewer members and diminished revenues. On the political front, 2018 election exit polls show a modest reinvigoration of the labor movement as a result of the threat posed by the Trump administration. The margin of support for Democratic House candidates among households with a union member was plus 22 (60-38) in 2014. That fell to plus 9 (53-44) in 2016. In 2018, the Democratic margin among union household voters was plus 18 (58-40). In addition, voters in Missouri, a red state, decisively rejected a proposed right-to-work law — an anti-union law — in an August 2018 referendum, 67.3 to 32.7 percent. Revived Democratic strength among union voters improves Democratic prospects in 2020, perhaps most especially for Joe Biden who, in his first campaign speech on Monday, affirmed his loyalty to the labor movement: “I make no apologies. I am a union man. Period.” Nationally, total contributions from labor political action committees rebounded slightly in 2018 from 2016 and 2014, but remained well below the 2010 level. According to OpenSecrets, labor PACs gave $58.2 million, mostly to Democrats, in 2018. In comparison, in 2010, labor PACs gave $74.2 million (in 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars). Public employee unions representing government workers — like AFSCME and the teachers’ unions — saw a similar drop: In 2018, their PACs gave $15.6 million, compared with $20.6 million adjusted for inflation in 2010. The damage inflicted on unions by enactment of right-to-work legislation is substantial and, in the case of the Wisconsin legislation, extremely difficult to reverse. Three scholars have produced a detailed analysis of the political effects of right-to-work laws which have been enacted in 27 states — most recently in Michigan and Indiana (2012), Wisconsin (2015), West Virginia (2016) and Kentucky (2017) — all states with once-strong union movements. In their February 2019 paper, “From the Bargaining Table to the Ballot Box: Political Effects of Right-to-Work Laws,” James Feigenbaum, an economist at Boston University, Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a political scientist at Columbia, and Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at Brookings, compared adjoining counties in states with and without right-to-work laws. Right-to-work laws, they write, “permit workers in a unionized business to opt out of paying dues to the union, even if those workers reap the benefits of collective bargaining and union representation.” These laws weaken “the organizational clout of labor unions.” The authors found “strong causal evidence” for the demobilizing “effects of right-to-work laws — examining state and federal elections from 1980 through 2016.” For Democrats, the demobilization after passage of such laws is devastating. “County-level Democratic vote shares in Presidential elections fall by 3.5 percentage points relative to bordering counties.” Turnout drops by 2 to 3 percent. The laws generally reduce Democratic vote share and turnout in U.S. Senate and House elections, as well as state gubernatorial races. Democratic seat shares in state legislatures also fall. The accompanying graphic shows the decline in Democratic voting in counties within states that adopt right-to-work laws compared with those that do not. A study of adjoining counties across state borders found that Democrats performed, in presidential elections, about the same on both sides — until one state adopted right-to-work laws. Then the county vote trends diverged.

Revenue for the Michigan Service Employees International Union “dropped to 14.5 percent of pre-right-to-work levels four years out, while revenue for AFSCME in Michigan decreased 40 percent.” Jarrett Skorup, director of communications at the Mackinac Center, one of many state-based conservative think tanks that have led anti-union drives across the country, wrote in 2017 on the center’s website: The Michigan branch of the Service Employees International Union representing home health care workers was riding high. It had 55,000 members, brought in $22 million annually and was able to spend nearly $3.5 million on politics. Then it all came crashing down. Five years later, the union is a shell of its former self. Membership plunged to under 10,000. Revenue is less than one-third what it was at its peak. Political spending bottomed out at less than 5 percent of what it once was. The opening slide in a PowerPoint presentation to Democratic and liberal donors by Blue Compass Strategies, a pro-labor consulting group, has the headline “The Right Has A Greater Appreciation Of Labor’s Role Than We Do” over a picture of Scott Walker signing Act 10 in 2011. While unions are taking a financial beating, the Blue Compass presentation documents the surge in contributions in the first half of this decade to state-level conservative groups — many of them linked to the conservative State Policy Network — that back right-to-work and other laws that constrain unions. From 2010 to 2015, for example, Blue Compass found, revenues rising from $1.8 million in 2010 to $5.6 million 2015 at the Illinois Policy Center; from $818,355 to $1.7 million at the Buckeye Institute in Ohio; from $440,244 to $1.9 million at the Washington Policy Center in Seattle. Revenues at the Mackinac Center grew from $3.4 million to $6.3 million over this same period. Cash flow to the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty grew from $511,939 in 2011 to $3 million in 2015. One of the better things to happen for Democrats, organized labor and public employee unions in particular, is that Grover Norquist’s call for 10 states to follow Scott Walker’s lead in Wisconsin and enact a version of Act 10 has not materialized. One of the key elements of Act 10 is that it uses the savings in reduced government employee pay and benefits to restructure the financing of state and local governments. As a result, repealing the Act would set in motion a chain reaction of politically damaging tax hikes. Christian Schneider, a conservative columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, delighted in telling readers that Even if they went ahead with repealing the law, Democrats would have to deal with the effects of reversing the myriad proposals under Act 10’s umbrella. One of Walker’s primary initiatives was to require state and local employees to start paying towards their pension and health care benefits, which saved both levels of government money. This allowed him to reduce aid to local governments and school districts, knowing they would be able to replenish those funds by having to pay less for employee benefits. If Democrats reinstate Wisconsin as a union utopia and teachers and local government employees once again start to collectively bargain, it will certainly increase the cost of providing services, and thus push property taxes significantly upward. That is, of course, unless the Democratic candidates want to move back to a system in which the state provides aid to local governments and school districts to subsidize these benefits. If that is the case, Democrats should be willing to provide examples of which state taxes they would raise to provide the billions of dollars it would take to restore this aid model. Tony Evers, the newly elected Democratic governor of Wisconsin, included a series of pro-labor provisions in his first budget: a call for the repeal of right-to-work laws, a $15 minimum wage on government projects and restoration of the state prevailing wage law. He did not, however, include repeal of Act 10. Marquette University Law School polled Wisconsin voters on Act 10 seven times between 2012 and 2018. In the first five, by small margins of 2 to 7 points, pluralities averaging 48.5 percent preferred to keep the law on the books, compared with 43 percent for repeal. In the two most recent surveys, however, a plurality, 44.5 percent, supported repeal while 43 percent backed retention. Hertel-Fernandez, the Columbia political scientist I mentioned earlier, wrote in the spring issue of the American Prospect: In contrast to conservatives’ view of unions as being central to politics, mainstream Democrats have been much more reluctant to recognize just how important labor has been to their party. Support for labor rights is not unanimous among Democrats in the same way that opposition to unions is among Republicans. Put simply, Hertel-Fernandez went on, there is no liberal version of state-level right-to-work laws that Democrats have consistently pursued over the years on a scale that matches conservative efforts to retrench labor power. Given the key role of organized labor in winning approval of the liberal agenda, Hertel-Fernandez argued that “labor reform ought to be a ‘day one’ issue for Democrats.” Even a cursory examination of the current jockeying for the Democratic presidential nomination shows, however, that labor law reform is nowhere near the top of the left’s order of business. Why is this? Joseph McCartin, a professor of history and the executive director of the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown, told the Pacific Standard that in contrast to the European experience, “in the U.S., there was never a durable labor party, and it does matter.” As a result, McCartin continued, The Democratic Party became labor’s more congenial ally, but it was never really all in. When priorities had to be set, the Democratic Party’s willingness to prioritize labor was never quite there. Most Democrats, 58 percent, have a favorable view of unions, according to Pew, but nearly a quarter, 23 percent, have a negative view. Clearly, other important matters — gender rights, immigration and civil rights — have taken precedence over the trade union movement in the contemporary Democratic debate on core objectives. And even economic inequality — which is closely tied to the strength of unions — is rarely discussed now in the context of the role of union representation in reducing these disparities. From 1983 to 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of American workers who were union members fell by 16.9 percent, from 17.7 million to 14.7 million, even as the total population grew by 40.8 percent, from 233.8 million to 329.1 million. As a result, organized labor is widely perceived as an institution in decline, when it needs, as Hertel Fernandez points out, a Democratic Party willing to invest political capital in turning the descent of labor around. The problem in building support for a resurgent labor movement is that many liberals and Democrats do not appear to recognize the crucial role that unions continue to play not only in diminishing the effects of inequality, but in voter mobilization and campaign finance. Unfortunately for labor, and for the future of the Democratic Party, groups that are shrinking in numbers and in financial resources lose political leverage and influence, the two commodities unions are most in need of. What too many on the left of the political spectrum also ignore (or fail to understand) is that labor unions are inextricably intertwined with the economic condition of women and minorities — and, for that matter, of white men. In other words, Democrats make a fundamental mistake if they engage in the politics of subtraction, downgrading the priority of battered but pivotal institutions like the labor movement. They would be wise to commit to the politics of addition instead — amplifying the power of labor to lift up the most loyal Democratic constituencies.

2019,‘The River and the Wall’ Review: Taking a Side on the Rio Grande,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The River and the Wall” comes on as innocent and glossy as a travelogue, but its scenic delights are the sugar coating on a passionate and spectacularly photographed political message. Traveling 1,200 miles along the Rio Grande, from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico, the director, Ben Masters, and four friends slowly and genially build an ecologically devastating case against the construction of President Trump’s much-ballyhooed border wall. Taking to mountain bikes, horses and canoes, this hardy group — comprising conservationists, an ornithologist, a river guide and a National Geographic explorer — is tested by treacherous terrain and dangerous river currents. The adventurers aim to document the possible impact of the proposed barrier on the region’s wildlife and residents; but a more personal, pro-immigration note is struck when two team members recall the emotional toll of growing up with undocumented parents. There’s nothing bullying about these segments. Instead, this casually relaxed documentary is both a vivid message movie and a wonder-filled paean to a singularly beautiful and biodiverse environment. Information slides unobtrusively over frames filled with rare birds and black bears, as Texas farmers and ranchers in the Rio Grande Valley discuss their fear of being sealed off from swaths of their land and access to seasonal labor. This is a region that thrives on the free movement of all kinds of life-forms. Filming from late 2017 to early 2018, with a small crew of rotating cinematographers, Masters captures moments both hairy and hilarious. (Encountering one of the region’s fence-like existing barriers, one of the group scampers up it with ease.) Guest appearances from Beto O’Rourke and the Republican Representative Will Hurd reinforce the movie’s anti-wall viewpoint. “We already have a physical barrier,” Hurd points out. “It’s called mountains.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,"‘The Russian Five’ Review: Out of the Iron Curtain, Onto the Ice","A documentary looks at the Detroit Red Wings and the hockey players they recruited from the Soviet Union. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. When they’re not punching each other in the face, the ice-hockey players in “The Russian Five” seem a lot like chess grandmasters. They’re that steeped in strategy. This documentary, directed by Joshua Riehl, recounts the story of the Detroit Red Wings of the 1980s and the early- to mid-90s. The team was a study in calamity. It hadn’t won a championship since 1955, and morale was abysmal, hence its nickname, the Dead Wings. The franchise was sold in 1982 to Mike Ilitch, the founder of the Little Caesars pizza chain, and the team’s management moved forward with a risky plan: To recruit star athletes from the Soviet Union. Getting those players into the United States from behind the Iron Curtain was tricky, and is chronicled here with intrigue and a few animated sections. Eventually the five men of the movie’s title arrived in Detroit after defecting or using other means of leaving the Soviet Union, and the Red Wings embarked on a rousing comeback. Riehl gears his documentary more toward avid fans than casual viewers, though he nods to the human side of story. There are cursory looks at the Russian players’ personal lives and their integration into American society. But this is foremost a study in team building and hockey tactics, and we get an abundance of ice time, much of it energizing to watch. There’s also ample footage of fighting. “I just was trying to take his head off with my fist,” one Red Wings player says of a hated opponent. Reader, forgive me: I came to hate that opponent, too.

2019,‘The Serengeti Rules’ Review: Making Science Spellbinding,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In his remarkable new documentary, the veteran filmmaker Nicolas Brown interviews prominent ecologists who study biodiversity — specifically, how one species can affect an entire ecosystem. Even if the film, “The Serengeti Rules,” were merely presenting credible research clearly, it would still be providing invaluable insight into the natural world at a time when as many as one million species face the threat of extinction. But Brown’s ambitions extend beyond summarizing data. Instead, his spectacular sequences — in the tide pools of the Pacific Northwest, in Amazon rain forests and in Tanzania’s Serengeti region, among other places — reproduce the circumstances of original studies, providing visual demonstrations of what makes environments thrive, falter or rebound. In one such sequence, Brown observes Aleutian kelp forests, recreating a study by the ecologist Jim Estes. As Estes recounts his observations of sea otters in their uninterrupted habitat, the camera dives beneath choppy waves to discover sea urchins purpling the rocks and iridescent fish flitting in schools around the up-climbing kelp. Not all of these species interact directly — yet when Brown incorporates footage of the region after the otters have disappeared, he finds the sea overflowing with urchins. Without otters, who acted as their main predator, the urchins ate all the kelp that once provided a home for fish. Brown’s images of barren seafloor match the conclusions of Estes’s research: In the Aleutian Islands, otters are a keystone species. When a keystone species is removed, the ecosystem, like a Roman arch, collapses. The great accomplishment of “The Serengeti Rules” is that it directs the viewer to see beauty in the way an ecologist might. Color, movement and texture all become indicators of ecological health. Seeking loveliness, the eye becomes trained to look for biodiversity. In mirroring the gaze of his professorial subjects, Brown rewards audiences with a film that happily weds the scientific and the cinematic. An earlier version of this review misstated the number of species thought to be at risk of extinction. It is as many as one million species, not millions of species.

2019,‘The Silence of Others’ Review: Franco’s Victims Speak Out,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. After Gen. Francisco Franco’s death in 1975, Spain faced the question of how to address crimes committed during nearly four decades of dictatorship. A 1977 amnesty law offered a solution, absolving Franco’s political opponents while shielding his supporters from prosecution. For the principal subjects of “The Silence of Others” — victims of human rights abuses during Franco’s regime, or in some cases their descendants — that amnesty law has proved a formidable obstacle to justice. Much of this documentary, directed by Almudena Carracedo and Robert Bahar, follows the progress of a lawsuit that a group filed in 2010 in Argentina, whose courts, using a principle called universal jurisdiction, could theoretically step in where Spain’s would not. Among those featured in the film are José María Galante, who explains that he lives “just meters” from the man he says tortured him. (There are shades of “Death and the Maiden” here.) Another plaintiff, Ascensión Mendieta Ibarra, seeks to recover the bones of her father, who died in 1939, from a mass grave. The movie is at its most startling in showing how vestiges of the Franco era have casually persisted in Spain, in the names of streets, for instance. The documentary could be clearer in explaining the intricacies of the international legal wrangling. Extradition proceedings are one thing, but the film is fuzzier on how a judge in Argentina is able to compel an exhumation in Spain. Of course, the mere existence of legal proceedings abroad puts pressure on Spain to attend to its past. That’s certainly the goal of this years-spanning documentary, which is informative, if not always as specific as it might have been.

2019,‘The Souvenir’ Review: A Great Movie About a Bad Boyfriend,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Souvenir” is one of my favorite movies of the year so far, but I almost want to keep it a secret. Partly because it’s the kind of film — we all have a collection of these, and of similar books and records, too — that feels like a private discovery, an experience you want to protect rather than talk about. A direct message like this, beamed from another person’s sensibility into your own sensorium, isn’t meant to be shared. That other person, in this case, is Joanna Hogg, who wrote and directed. (Her previous features are “Exhibition,” “Archipelago” and “Unrelated,” all very much worth seeking out.) But there’s also something specific to the manner, mood and subject of her tale of amour fou and artistic aspiration in early ’80s London that invites discretion. “The Souvenir” feels like a whispered confidence, an intimate disclosure that shouldn’t be betrayed because it isn’t really yours. There’s an interesting paradox here: a movie that feels like it was meant for you alone and also like none of your business. Watching the oblique scenes unfold, at first mysteriously and then with ever greater force and clarity, you might believe yourself more of an eavesdropper than a confidant, as if you were sitting at the next table at the ridiculously fancy tearoom where Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) and Anthony (Tom Burke) have come on a date. Are we sure they’re dating? (Julie’s mother, played by Byrne’s real-life mother, Tilda Swinton, persists in supposing otherwise.) What exactly is their deal? Julie’s is that she’s a film student, trying to put together an ambitious, somewhat vague-sounding thesis set in the northern port city of Sunderland. It’s about a boy named Tony who loses his mother, though the more we hear about the project the less clear it seems. This is partly because the fictional Tony is often competing for Julie’s attention with the actual Anthony. We surmise that Anthony is at least a few years older than Julie and also different from the relaxed, racially and sexually diverse group of friends and schoolmates who gather at her apartment to drink, smoke and listen to records. Anthony seems, at least at first glance, to be from what the British would call a rather posh background. His ironical, world-weary way of talking and his chalk-striped suits and monogrammed slippers suggest a privileged upbringing. Julie, by contrast, puts out a decidedly middle-class vibe, including the way she self-consciously checks her own privilege in conversations with her professors. But these first impressions are soon revealed to be completely backward. Anthony’s father (James Dodds) is a former shipyard worker and an art school graduate who lives with the rest of the family in cozy, rural Bohemian dishevelment. Julie’s parents, meanwhile (the marvelous James Spencer Ashworth plays her father), reek of old, landed money, with aristocratic manners, solidly but not stridently conservative views and enough cash to subsidize their daughter’s student lifestyle in a comfortable Knightsbridge duplex. Anthony claims to work for the Foreign Office. A note of skepticism is in order for the simple reason that, as Julie slowly discovers, he has a habit of lying about nearly everything. It’s not his only habit. I hesitate to mention this — less because of spoiler sensitivity than because of a strange impulse to protect the privacy of fictional beings — but he’s also a heroin addict. And now, like Julie, I’m inclined to make excuses. Not to deny or minimize the increasingly obvious fact of Anthony’s drug use — as Julie does for as long as she can — but to dispel certain false impressions that the mention of it might leave behind. There is a way of describing “The Souvenir” at the level of plot that makes it sound interesting and absorbing but also conventional: another chronicle of addiction and codependency, another cautionary fable of a smart woman making a foolish choice, another period drama celebrating a wilder time. It sort of is all of that, but it is also emphatically not that at all. The title refers to a small, exquisite painting by the 18th-century French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard that Anthony and Julie behold on one of their maybe-dates. It depicts a young woman, sharply scrutinized by her pet dog, carving letters into the trunk of a tree. “She’s very much in love,” Anthony says with suave certainty, and perhaps he’s right. But there’s a lot more going on in the picture — and in the moving picture that shares its name — than that simple declaration would suggest. The woman is making a mark and putting down a marker, declaring her own presence with a mixture of shame and audacity, impulsiveness and deliberation. Julie isn’t quite so bold, or so embarrassed. She does love Anthony, of course, and she sacrifices a great deal for him without quite realizing what she’s doing. Over the span of the film — it’s hard to know exactly how much time is passing, which is of course exactly how the passage of time can feel — her friends slip away, and the work that had seemed so urgent feels a bit more remote. But the interplay of forces in Julie’s life is subtle, as is the balance, in her own temperament, between decisiveness and passivity. Byrne is a revelation, and Julie is an embodiment of the awkwardness and heedless grace of young adulthood almost without precedent in the movies. Byrne is, of course, the child of one of the greatest actresses alive, but her own talent is of an entirely different order. The point of Julie is that she’s a half-formed creature who we’re watching take shape, partly through the development of her own nature and partly under the influence of external forces. With her soft features and hesitant diction, Byrne gives Julie’s confusion a sensual, almost metaphysical, intensity. For the duration of “The Souvenir,” nothing in the world is more important than what will happen to her. Or, to adjust the grammar a bit, what will turn out to have happened. This movie is a memory piece, after all (with a sequel in the works), set at a time of I.R.A. bombings and ascendant Thatcherism. It’s also a coming-of-age story, implying a backward-looking perspective of maturity. The grain of the film (David Raedeker is the director of photography) shrouds the action in a delicate caul of nostalgia, communicating an ache that Julie can’t yet feel but that we can see forming inside her. This is one of the saddest movies you can imagine, and it’s an absolute joy to watch.

2019,"‘The Spy Behind Home Plate’ Review: Play Ball, Fight Nazis","A documentary tells the story of Moe Berg, a major-league catcher who went undercover during World War II. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Moe Berg’s story is so good that you’ll forgive “The Spy Behind Home Plate” for overtelling it. Berg, a son of Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants, grew up in New York City and Newark. After graduating from Princeton he played baseball professionally for 15 seasons while earning a law degree at Columbia University and passing the bar exam. He spoke at least 10 languages and befriended several famous figures of his time, including Albert Einstein and Babe Ruth. And somewhere along the way he became a spy. In the run-up to World War II, Berg gathered information on Japan during a visit there. When the war began, he was recruited as an agent by the Office of Strategic Services, a precursor to the C.I.A. He went behind enemy lines in Europe to uncover secrets about the Nazi nuclear program, and was a hair’s breadth away from assassinating Werner Heisenberg. Aviva Kempner, the documentary’s director, packs in plenty of other exploits. More than 60 historians, journalists and family members (some in archival videos) are heard from, including Nicholas Dawidoff, whose book “The Catcher Was a Spy” recounted Berg’s adventures and was made into a 2018 feature film. Barbara Ballow, the documentary’s skillful editor, would have been justified in billing for triple overtime with all the footage and photographs used here. There’s much to absorb throughout “The Spy Behind Home Plate,” and sometimes details speed by too fast or digressions go on a bit long. Still, Kempner’s passion for her remarkable subject is always evident. If she wants you to know a lot about Moe Berg, that’s because there’s a lot worth knowing. The Spy Behind Home Plate Not rated.

2019,"‘The Sun Is Also a Star’ Review: A Charming, if Generic, Adolescent Love Story","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A few years ago, I was giving a talk somewhere, and a gentleman in the audience asked, “What is the role of free will in criticism?” I didn’t have a good answer, but the question came back to haunt me during a recent screening of “The Sun Is Also a Star,” a film much concerned with issues of chance, destiny and choice. What, I wondered, had brought me to that dark room where two nice-looking teenagers (Yara Shahidi of “black-ish” and Charles Melton of “Riverdale”) were canoodling in a karaoke booth, and then on an empty Roosevelt Island tram car hovering above the East River? Was it fate? A series of decisions I had made earlier in my life, or that someone else had made for me? Might I find the answers in the writings of Carl Sagan or the poems of Emily Dickinson? If you are fascinated by this line of inquiry, you might enjoy this super-sincere young-adult romance, directed by Ry Russo-Young from Tracy Oliver’s screenplay and based on Nicola Yoon’s best-selling novel. But philosophical interests aren’t a prerequisite and may in fact interfere with the business of watching the two main characters banter, flirt and then, at last, make out. That’s not a spoiler: If you didn’t know that Shahidi and Melton were destined to make out within 10 minutes of seeing them onscreen, you have no hope of passing whatever class this is. Natasha Kingsley (Shahidi) lives in Brooklyn, Daniel Bae (Melton) in Queens. One radiantly sunlit morning, they both have urgent business in Manhattan. Daniel has an alumni interview that he hopes will get him into Dartmouth, a first step in realizing his parents’ dream that he’ll become a doctor. His own ambitions are more literary, but as the dutiful first-generation son of Korean immigrants, he accepts his destiny. Natasha, whose family came to New York from Jamaica when she was in grade school, is on a desperate mission to prevent their deportation. Her parents (Miriam A. Hyman and Gbenga Akinnagbe) are resigned to leaving — they are scheduled to depart the day after most of the movie’s action takes place — but their daughter is determined to find someone to handle the family’s legal appeal so they can stay in the city she loves. (The someone turns out to be a subdued John Leguizamo.) The filmmakers love the city, too. Their ardor is expressed in aerial and street-level shots that highlight the romance of New York without sanding off too much of the grit. (Autumn Durald Arkapaw is the director of photography.) Not that grittiness is the aesthetic here. It’s all warmth and magic and smart, striving kids taking themselves seriously so the audience can have a good time. The story and its trappings feel a little generic, the dialogue studiously bland and the characters and their problems curiously weightless, in spite of gestures in the direction of real-world issues. Natasha and Daniel are sealed in a protective bubble, cushioned in sentimental pop music of various styles and eras — would a Gen Z kid really pick “Crimson and Clover” at karaoke? I don’t know, but it kind of works — and filmed as if they were the most adorable puppies ever to snuggle on Instagram. They are so appealing — I mean, his last name is Bae, and she never makes a joke about it — that you will totally believe that he is a budding poet and that her thing is astronomy. I’m not saying you wouldn’t believe it otherwise, but the passions that these two proclaim for things that aren’t each other seem a bit decorative. They do argue some about fate, love, free will and the nature of the cosmos, but this is mostly so their mouths can get some exercise before they start kissing. There are complications — canceled appointments, Daniel’s racist jerk of an older brother (Jake Choi), a stalled subway train, fate and family — but nothing all that complicated. “The Sun Is Also a Star,” like its title, doesn’t benefit from overthinking. The themes serve the mood, which is charming. You could choose to believe otherwise, of course, but why be that way?

2019,‘The Tale of Genji’ and the Art It Inspired,"Critic’s Pick A show at the Metropolitan Museum is as sumptuous and seductive as the Japanese novel that begot it. Not every enduring literary masterpiece inspires a thousand years of often great art. “The Tale of Genji,” written in early-11th-century Japan and possibly the world’s first novel, is an exception. A narratively rich saga of life and love at the Japanese imperial court, it spurred innovation and was in many ways foundational to Japanese art itself. Similarly, only a few museums can do justice to such a long span of creativity. Prominent among them is the Metropolitan Museum of Art, whose “‘The Tale of Genji’: A Japanese Classic Illuminated,” is glorious, as sumptuous and sprawling as the book itself, full of rare loans from Japanese institutions. “Genji,” the book, is one of the monuments of Japan’s Heian period (794-1185), widely considered its golden age. It was then that the kingdom decisively freed itself from Chinese influence, developing, for example, its own syllabic writing, called kana, in which “Genji” was executed, and which shortly became the basis for a new Japanese calligraphy. At the same time, the Japanese emperors were becoming largely ceremonial, if not decadent; in reality, Japan was ruled by a succession of aristocratic clans, headed by a shogun, starting with the Fujiwara family. Written by a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, the novel captures the aestheticism, intrigue and mores of court life as they swirl around the irresistibly handsome, polyamorous, morally flexible (and fictional) Prince Genji — a.k.a. the Shining Prince. The story unfolds in 54 linked chapters with a large cast that includes beautiful live-in mistresses, part-time lovers, children, devoted retainers and Genji bros. (In “An Imperial Celebration of Autumn Foliage,” Chapter 7, the Shining Prince cavorts with his closest friend, To no Chujo, in a dance of the blue waves.) Genji is a playboy prince, but a neurotic one, a Don Juan with more than a touch of Hamlet, capable of remorse, guilt and depression and a kind of obsessive self-pity. He also weeps easily. Perhaps before it was even finished, chapters of “Genji” began to circulate at court and beyond and soon its author achieved a quiet celebrity. She became known as Lady Murasaki Shikibu, after her book’s main female character and Genji’s great love. “Genji” has an emotional intensity that feels startlingly modern especially in its characters’ constant enumerations of their inner lives and mood swings. It is a romantic novel, suffused with melancholy and poetic longing and sometimes interrupted by impulsive actions with a fairly high #MeToo quotient. Genji may have raped one of his conquests; he kidnapped Murasaki virtually on first sight, when she was 10. Within a century of its writing, Japanese artists were rising to the epic’s challenge, giving its scenes visual form in illustrated “Genji” albums, handscrolls, hanging scrolls, large folding screens and, less familiar, a dazzling, miniaturized version of colorless ink-line painting. Over the course of the show we see the country’s pictorial sensibility emerge: the delicate isometric renderings of architecture and the blown-off roof that give interiors and exteriors equal visibility (since Genji is often on the outside peeping in). And the low-lying gold-leaf clouds that accentuate the aerial view tantalizingly block out bits of action and add great decorative verve. You can see these elements in a nascent relatively crude state in the 12th-century “Tale of Genji Handscrolls.” Among the oldest surviving Genji manuscripts, these scrolls could not travel but the Tokugawa Art Museum in Nagoya, has sent in their stead meticulous copies made from 1926 to 1935 by the artist Tanaka Shinbi (1875-1975). Real or not, seeing them is a bit like seeing Early Renaissance paintings for the first time. The show includes Genji-related tea bowls, kimonos, household furnishings and a lacquered wood palanquin on loan from the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution. Built in 1856 for the bride of a Tokugawa shogun, its exterior is patterned in gold and silver, its interior painted with suitable “Genji” vignettes. There are also Edo period woodblock parodies, some openly erotic. Despite its many romantic assignations and encounters, “Genji” never is. This lavishness has been assembled by John T. Carpenter, the Met’s Japanese art curator and Melissa McCormick professor of Japanese art and culture at Harvard University, with Monika Bincsik and Kyoko Kinoshita. Murasaki, the writer, became a legend in her own right. Early in the exhibition you’ll encounter several nearly matching hand-scroll portrait-icons of her opulently dressed, bending over her writing table — a lacquered wood example is also on view. In each her opulent robes rise around her like a small mountain range, through which her long hair often extends like a sinuous river. Although her surroundings are sparse if not nonexistent, she is at Ishiyamadera, a Buddhist temple where she may have gone to write her novel. While there, Murasaki is said to have been encouraged in her task by the bodhisattva Nyoirin Kannon. And he too is in the show: a 10th-century sculpture in gilded lacquered wood from the Ishiyamadera Temple that was worshiped in Murasaki’s day. Some measure of the different ways “The Tale of Genji” has been adapted by artists comes into focus when you track some of the more famous chapters through the show. For example, the first version here of Chapter 12, “Exile to Suma” — in which Genji is traumatized by being briefly banished from Kyoto to Japan’s southern coast where he endures boredom, anxiety and rough weather — is a mid-13th-century manuscript executed in beautiful tendrils of calligraphy on decorated paper, but without illustrations. A storm is readily apparent in a late-16th-century screen dominated by enormous curling, dragon-like waves rendered primarily in ink while our hero sits bravely in a small shelter on the shore (far right). Next, an early 17th-century hanging scroll by Iwasa Matabei (1578-1650) zeros in on this structure, with Genji standing facing the wind, his kimono billowing, behind semitransparent bamboo blinds called misu that are in actual use elsewhere in the show. Similarly, “A Boat Cast Adrift” (Chapter 51), which shows Genji’s grandson, Niou, and Ukifune, his lover, sitting alone in a skiff on the Uji River, appears in two screens along with scenes from other chapters, while a two-panel treatment from 1966 by Sata Yoshiro (1922-1997), shows only the boat and its nearly life-size passengers, who now recline. Toward the exhibition’s end, a wonderful mid-17th-century two-panel screen of three courtesans, the boat scene is diminished. It appears in a tiny painting on the sliding door to another room, where it reads as an invitation to intimacy. The Tale of Genji: A Japanese Classic Illuminated Through June 16 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Manhattan; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. An earlier version of this review referred incorrectly to the source of a lacquered wood palanquin. It is on loan from the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, not part of the Metropolitan Museum's collection. It also misidentified the name of the river in the work “A Boat Cast Adrift.” It is the Uji River, not Ufi. And a picture caption, using information from the museum, misidentified a ceramic tea bowl's design. It is Yugao, not Ygao.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Third Wife’ Review: Cruelty and Sensuality in 19th-Century Vietnam,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At 14, May (Nguyen Phuong Tra My) travels up river to marry a man she has never met and start a new life on his family’s silk plantation. The household, which includes servants, her husband’s two other wives and their children, is a place where intimacy and cruelty can be hard to tell apart. It’s the center of a world rendered with pathos and somewhat prurient fascination in “The Third Wife,” Ash Mayfair’s finespun debut feature. The setting is 19th-century Vietnam, which Mayfair, who was born in Ho Chi Minh City and studied film at New York University, renders with delicate precision. May’s new home, in a steep valley with flowering trees and airy wooden buildings, is both paradise and prison. Governed by rigid, patriarchal customs and rituals, her daily routines also make room for solitude and even pleasure. The two senior wives, Lao (Nguyen Nhu Quynh Le) and Xuan (Mai Thu Huong), welcome her with big-sisterly advice about sex, childbirth and domestic politics. The story, which follows May from the day of her arrival through a pregnancy, illuminates her social and physical surroundings with quiet clarity. The seasons of her forced transition from child to mother are measured against the life cycle of the silk worms, a source of metaphorical as well as economic sustenance. Like them, the wives are part of a cottage industry that mixes beauty and utility, captives of their own productivity. When May becomes pregnant, she prays for a boy, observing that Xuan, who has given birth to two daughters, holds a lower status than Lao, the mother of sons. She also observes the affair between Xuan and their husband’s oldest son, a relationship that brings conflict and tragedy to the clan and some heavy-breathing al fresco eroticism to the film. The sensuality that Mayfair and Chananun Chotrungroj, the director of photography, create around May is seductive, and also unnerving. “The Third Wife” presents a tableau of injustice — a male-dominated hierarchy that directly oppresses women and brings collateral misery to some men as well — from a perspective that feels both compassionate and detached. It’s too cool for melodrama and too pretty for politics, and the drama of May’s experience occupies a middle ground between pity and indignation. The cruelty she encounters is a fact of life, as is the solidarity she occasionally experiences with Lao and especially with the unfailingly kind Xuan. The possibility of freedom occasionally stirs like a faint breeze, and the film’s final scenes hint at desperate and defiant acts of resistance. But the movie is also trapped in the same claustrophobia it depicts, unsure of how much it can or wants to get away with.

2019,"‘The Time Is Now’: States Are Rushing to Restrict Abortion, or to Protect It","WASHINGTON — In April, Indiana placed a near-total ban on the most common type of second-trimester abortion in the state. Days later, Ohio passed a bill banning abortion in the very early weeks of pregnancy after a fetal heartbeat is detected. Now on Wednesday, Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama signed a bill effectively banning the procedure altogether, and lawmakers in two more states — Louisiana and Missouri — moved ahead with bills similar to Ohio’s. States across the country are passing some of the most restrictive abortion legislation in decades, deepening the growing divide between liberal and conservative states and setting up momentous court battles that could profoundly reshape abortion access in America. “This has been the most active legislative year in recent memory,” said Steven Aden, general counsel of Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group. The national race to pass new legislation began last fall, after President Trump chose Brett M. Kavanaugh to replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court, adding what some predicted would be a fifth vote to uphold new limits on abortion. Red states rushed to pass more restrictions and blue states to pass protections. Louisiana joined several others states in effectively prohibiting abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. [A guide to what is likely to come after Alabama’s abortion bill.] Now, as state legislative sessions draw to a close in many places, experts count about 30 abortion laws that have passed so far. That is not necessarily more than in past years, said Elizabeth Nash, a legal expert at the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. What’s different is the laws themselves, which have gone further than ever to frontally challenge Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling that established federal protections for abortion. And more are coming. On Wednesday, a committee of the Louisiana House in Baton Rouge advanced a fetal heartbeat bill as abortion rights activists demonstrated outside the chamber. And early Thursday, the Missouri Senate passed a fetal heartbeat bill that includes an exception for medical emergencies, but not for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. “This is a very serious situation,” Ms. Nash said. “We are really facing a point at which the courts may make a shift on abortion rights.” [Read more about Missouri’s bill to ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected.] For years, state legislatures have taken bites out of abortion access through laws that often failed in the courts. But over time, the courts have grown more sympathetic, and a broad swath of the country’s middle and south now has minimal access to the procedure. Six states each have only one abortion clinic left: Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia. But Mr. Trump’s changes on the Supreme Court have altered the terms of the fight, filling anti-abortion activists with hope that their 40-year effort to overturn Roe entirely might finally succeed. “There are many states that believe that the time is now for the Supreme Court to reconsider the blanket prohibition that Roe v. Wade expressed,” Mr. Aden said. [The Supreme Court’s conservative majority may prefer to chip away at abortion rights rather than overrule Roe v. Wade outright.] In Alabama, Governor Ivey signed the law saying it “stands as a powerful testament to Alabamians’ deeply held belief that every life is precious, that every life is a sacred gift from God.” One clear sign of change is the way fetal heartbeat bills, once at the fringes of the anti-abortion movement, have become mainstream for Republican-controlled states. Ohio became the first state to try to pass one in 2011, but the state’s largest anti-abortion group, Ohio Right to Life, didn’t even push for it. Its legal chances seemed slim, given the direct challenge it presented to established Supreme Court precedent. That changed last year, when Mr. Trump named Mr. Kavanaugh to the court. A heartbeat bill sped through the Ohio Legislature this year and was signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine in April. Three other states have passed such laws this year: Georgia, Kentucky and Mississippi. More are moving through the legislatures of 11 states, Ms. Nash said. Many of the laws being passed to restrict abortion will not go into effect, at least not now. Abortion rights advocates are challenging them in court. But anti-abortion campaigners say that’s exactly the outcome they want. “There’s only one way to get a case before the U.S. Supreme Court — someone has to sue us, and that happened today,” said Michael Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life in Columbus. He pointed out that Mr. Trump has appointed several judges to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, often a crucial final stop before the Supreme Court. “We are very encouraged that we are going to have great success,” Mr. Gonidakis said. B. Jessie Hill, a lawyer who helped file a legal challenge to Ohio’s law on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday, said, “I genuinely think that the future of Roe is the most precarious it has ever been since 1973.” Some anti-abortion activists believe states have gone too far in pushing restrictions that directly challenge Roe. There’s no guarantee that the Supreme Court would rule in their favor, they say, and the energy could be better spent on other things. “Events have overtaken us,” said Samuel Lee, an anti-abortion lobbyist in Missouri. “The advice of lawyers is of less concern than it ever has been in the pro-life movement right now. Sometimes people just want something. Social movements can take on a life of their own.” Liberal-leaning states are moving, too. Ms. Nash said about nine states are considering some type of legislation that would strengthen abortion rights. New York passed a law protecting abortion in later stages of pregnancy, and similar laws are now moving in Vermont and Rhode Island. Some states, including Nevada and New Mexico, are also working to repeal old restrictions that have been on the books for decades, to prevent them from being enforced if Roe were overturned. On Wednesday morning, about 100 reproductive health care providers and advocates fanned out across the Illinois State Capitol to urge lawmakers to take up the Reproductive Health Act, which would protect abortion rights. After visiting four offices, Dr. Erin King, the executive director of Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, said preserving abortion rights in Illinois was important because so many surrounding states have passed restrictive laws, and women travel to clinics in Illinois for care. “Every time I go to sleep and wake up, there is a new law in a state around us that is either restricting abortion further or essentially banning it,” she said. “If you told me this was going to happen a year ago, I would not have believed it.” transcript It’s not the first time that activists in the abortion movement believed Roe was about to be overturned. When the Supreme Court took up Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a case it ruled on in 1992, both sides of the issue felt certain that it would mean the end of federal abortion protections. Instead, it affirmed them, while opening the door for individual states to regulate at later stages of pregnancy. But nearly 30 years later, the country’s politics have grown more polarized. Before, some moderate Republicans supported abortion and some conservative Democrats opposed it. Now that political middle has all but disappeared. While similar legislation is popping up everywhere, each state has its own unique politics. The signing of a six-week fetal heartbeat ban by Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia came after a long period of relative quiet on the abortion front in the state. The last major abortion law that passed in the state was in 2012. But Mr. Kemp’s narrow victory in November over Stacey Abrams, a Democrat, changed things. An underdog candidate in the Republican primary, Mr. Kemp rocketed to victory with hard-right messaging that included a promise to personally round up illegal immigrants in his truck, and, significantly, to sign a heartbeat bill outlawing abortions after six weeks. “He wanted to establish his conservative credentials and to do that you have to check the abortion box,” said Stacey Evans, a Democrat and former member of the Georgia House who ran in the Democratic primary for governor last year. “And he did.” The Georgia law might get caught up in court. But Dr. Atsuko Koyama, a pediatrician based in Atlanta who provides abortions in a separate practice, believes that the Georgia law is having an effect anyway — by scaring and confusing patients. “There’s definitely been some people who have been scared that maybe we’d turn them away,” Dr. Koyama said, “but we’re very quick to reassure them that we’re open for business.”",The New York Times

2019,‘The Tomorrow Man’ Review: Love Among the Neuroses,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Sometimes you’d think there was a conspiracy among movie stylists to turn older female characters into a combination of sister-wife and refugee from a Laura Ashley sample sale. As Ronnie in the late-life romance “The Tomorrow Man,” the lovely Blythe Danner is their latest victim. Swathed in mismatched separates, shapeless woolens and schoolgirl ankle socks, Ronnie is supposed to look quirky; instead, she just looks like she doesn’t own a full-length mirror. Written and directed by Noble Jones, “The Tomorrow Man” is a cloying, at times disturbing tale of two dotty seniors whose eccentricities unexpectedly mesh. Ronnie’s issues, though — she’s a timid hoarder who likes war documentaries — are mild compared to the aggressively paranoid lens through which Ed (John Lithgow) views the world. An apocalypse-obsessed retiree whose time is spent stocking his fallout shelter and communing online with fellow doom-and-gloom survivalists, Ed stalks Ronnie at the supermarket until she agrees to have coffee with him. Ignoring the fact that Ed should scare, rather than charm, most women like Ronnie, “The Tomorrow Man” wends its whimsical way toward love, using physical objects as metaphors for psychological baggage. There is a market for this kind of low-key pablum — especially with such fine leads — where characters are little more than bundles of idiosyncrasies. Yet it’s precisely because Lithgow is so good that Ed’s alarming mental problems resist the movie’s pressure to turn them into comic relief. Had Jones embraced this, a potentially more honest and involving story about dating and mental decline might have resulted, one that didn’t downplay Ed’s hallucinations or his upsetting family dynamics.

2019,‘The Wandering Soap Opera’ Review: An Excursion Into Raúl Ruiz’s Fertile Mind,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The prolific filmmaker Raúl Ruiz left his native Chile after the 1973 military coup and found refuge in France, where he lived until his death, at 70, in 2011. In 1990, at the end of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, Ruiz returned to his homeland to work on a project called (in English translation) “The Wandering Soap Opera.” It was left unfinished at the time, but a version has now, belatedly, been completed by Valeria Sarmiento, Ruiz’s fellow cineaste, frequent collaborator and also his wife. “The Wandering Soap Opera” begins and ends with black-and-white still photographs of Ruiz on the set, poignant reminders of his indefatigable creativity and tenacious productivity. The film, a mock anthology of fragmentary episodes from preposterous telenovelas, is a minor addition to the Ruiz corpus, which runs to more than 100 titles, among them a handful of masterpieces. It was clearly made with slender financial means and abundant enthusiasm, and it functions simultaneously as a critique of the self-serious idiocy of authority and a celebration of the anarchic power of imagination. As a young man, Ruiz wrote scripts for Mexican and Chilean telenovelas, and the open-ended, all-inclusive, anti-realistic spirit of the form stayed with him through his career. In “The Wandering Soap Opera,” reality itself is reimagined as an interlocking set of interminable melodramas, crime stories and romances. The seven chapters — one for each day of the week, as they might unfold on television — are presented in sequence, but they also nest inside one another like matryoshka dolls. If the dolls had been designed by Max Ernst or Salvador Dalí. There is, accordingly, no real summary to be offered. The first “day,” “People Are Watching Us,” starts out as a tale of bourgeois adultery with vague political implications and quickly sets the tone for what will follow. The line readings are unfailingly earnest, and the lines themselves are non sequiturs, riddles and cryptic jokes. Scenarios of romantic deception and skulduggery are threaded with political implications. When a man tells his lover that he prefers her left leg to her right, she wonders if that means he’s a leftist. In Pinochet’s Chile, the question wasn’t a laughing matter, but in Ruiz’s world, matters of life and death are never without a dimension of absurdity. “The Wandering Soap Opera,” shot in fuzzy-gumdrop colors on Super 16-millimeter film, offers a portal into that world, a series of sketches by a master whose work always rewards discovery.

2019,‘The Weekly’ Wants to Show You That ‘Reporters Are Not Robots’,"Times Insider A new TV show from The Times places journalists’ expertise — and their inner conflicts — center stage. Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. In the afternoon on Oct. 25, Jason Stallman received a text message: “I have a potential story for you.” It was Katie Benner, who covers the Justice Department for The New York Times, alerting Mr. Stallman, the editor of “The Weekly,” a new TV show from The Times, about an education fraud investigation that Ms. Benner and Erica L. Green were trying to break before a competitor. They were writing an article about a Louisiana school accused of submitting fraudulent college applications for its students and even of abusing them, and Ms. Benner wondered if it would make a compelling video narrative for “The Weekly.” They met that same day, “and we were off and running,” Mr. Stallman said. Eight months, three trips to Louisiana, dozens of interviews and 60 hours of filming later, the story became the first episode of “The Weekly,” premiering Sunday on FX and Monday on Hulu. In the episode, viewers will watch the story of the school, T.M. Landry College Preparatory, unfold as Ms. Benner and Ms. Green meet with students who risk their futures to tell the truth, often in emotional interviews in their homes. The episode also depicts something that often does not make it into conversations about investigative journalism: the behind-the-scenes turmoil of reporters who worry that their coverage will do more damage to the victims of abuse than to its perpetrators. “I’m not going to lie,” Ms. Green says onscreen as she sits at Ms. Benner’s dining table, with her face in her hands. “Over the weekend, I had a few moments where I was like, ‘Can I do this? I don’t know if I can do this.’” The reporters’ experiences are not the central focus of the show, which tells stories that include original reporting for “The Weekly,” follow-ups on Times journalism and more. But the show does elevate their expertise to center stage. “We think that one of the distinguishing features of this show will certainly be the reporters and how they navigate these stories,” Mr. Stallman said. “These reporters are not robots. They’re human beings who are torturing themselves to be as careful and conscientious as possible.” There is no host of “The Weekly,"" a choice its creators debated for months. Instead, different reporters who know their beats well lead audiences through the reporting process, the meaning of a story and the debates behind it. “The Weekly” was sold to FX in May 2018, and it came as a natural follow-up to The Times’s runaway-hit podcast “The Daily,” said Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor who helped to create both. “We've got people who are on the ground all over the world,” he said, “and we should show our audience what it’s like there and what our reporters do.” “We spent a long time thinking about what we wanted to achieve with this show,” Mr. Dolnick added. One thing was clear from the beginning: It would not be a traditional news show, running through the week’s major headlines. Instead, Mr. Dolnick said, each episode aims to tell “a story that we're putting on the map that our newsroom found,” often with investigative aspects and subject matter that touches on the biggest conversations of the moment. Episodes in the first season follow New York’s taxi medallion bubble, terrorism in Tajikistan, the separation of two parents from their infant at the United States’ southern border and President Trump’s inauguration, among other things. And although the show is deeply rooted in Times journalism, not every compelling print article translates to video. In a narrative documentary, audiences “want to see something happening and unfolding in front of the camera,” typically with access to the story’s major characters, said Liz Day, a senior story editor. In the case of the T.M. Landry episode, those characters are the parents and students who spoke out against the school — like Nyjal Mitchell, who said that when he was 14, Michael Landry, who runs the school, assaulted him. He filed a police report, and said he and his family were the victims of a smear campaign by Mr. Landry. This time, he was not alone in going public, and his voice traveled farther than it had before. “Getting to watch him speak his truth and come forward and try to clear his name was so powerful, and it was so special that we got to capture it on camera,” Samantha Stark, a producer, said. “It’s a whole different thing to watch the expression on the child’s face when they’re telling the story.” The T.M. Landry story was also a way to chip away at larger topics — in this case, education, race and the myths of meritocracy. The show’s producers aim to touch on complicated themes with each episode. “This is exactly the sort of story we want to tackle,” said Mat Skene, one of the show’s executive producers, “because you think you know something” — in this case, an inspiring school sending its predominantly black, working-class students to the nation’s most elite universities — “but it’s actually something else.” In the end, no former T.M. Landry student in college that The Times knows of was punished or dismissed over the article’s revelations. And for some of them, publication was a proud moment or represented the lifting of a burden. Around 5 a.m. on Nov. 30, the crew of “The Weekly” collected about 10 copies of that day’s New York Times in Breaux Bridge, La., and visited students’ homes as they saw the article in print for the first time. That night, they headed to the Mitchell family’s home, camera in tow, as Nyjal and his sister Sanaa were getting ready for bed. To the family’s surprise, the article had made the front page — along with Nyjal’s picture. Sanaa looked at her brother in their living room as he scanned the paper in shock. “I’m proud of him,” she said. Reflecting on that moment, Alexandra Garcia, a senior story producer, said: “The way she looks at him, you don’t even need to have words. You just feel it.” Watch “The Weekly” on FX on Sunday at 10 p.m., Eastern, and find it online here.

2019,"‘The Worst Is Over’: A Sigh of Relief in India, Mostly Spared by Cyclone","PURI, India — The road to Puri was lined with large downed trees. Electricity poles made of cement and steel lay scattered on the ground, along with roofing tiles, pieces of billboard and crumpled iron sheeting. The walls of many buildings had collapsed, leaving countless people homeless. But on Saturday as residents of this seaside town emerged from shelters to assess the property damage unleashed by Cyclone Fani, there was a sense of relief. The storm, one of the biggest in years, had slammed into India’s eastern coast on Friday, roaring through towns with winds of 120 miles per hour. Yet so many precious lives had been spared. Fewer than 20 fatalities were reported, compared with the thousands killed 20 years ago, when a similar cyclone swept over the same area. That is because authorities here had whisked more than a million people to safety, executing a meticulous evacuation plan that they have been perfecting ever since that disastrous storm in 1999. Though many poor people lost everything they owned, as the skies cleared on Saturday and the sunshine returned, there was a widespread feeling that this could have been so much deadlier. “It seems the worst is over,” said Bishnupada Sethi, the special relief commissioner in the Indian state of Odisha, which bore the initial brunt of the storm. Over the past few days, as the cyclone barreled up the Bay of Bengal toward India, the authorities in Odisha helped move people to higher ground and into specially built cyclone shelters. In neighboring Bangladesh, lashed by the weakened storm on Saturday, another million people were similarly taken out of harm’s way. It was a huge, meticulously organized lifesaving operation and, it seems, a success story for the government’s early-warning system. Indian officials transmitted millions of text messages, broadcast warnings over public address systems and sent fleets of buses to scoop up vulnerable people, bringing them to hundreds of sturdy cyclone shelters that had been stocked with water and food. By the time Fani hit on Friday morning, knocking down trees and obliterating shack houses, just about everybody was safe. Authorities said the relatively few fatalities were people who had not heeded their warnings. Many people remained in the shelters, fearful of floods and other hazards like downed electrical wires. “They are welcome to stay as long as they want,” said Satyajit Mohanty, a police official in Bhubaneswar, an inland city. The airport there sustained damage but was scheduled to reopen Saturday night. The cyclone’s storm surge, which pushed waves deep inland, swamped entire villages. Odisha is one of India’s poorest states, home to around 46 million people. Mr. Mohanty predicted it would take months for people to rebuild their homes. He said the state authorities would “chip in.” Early indications on Saturday were that Bangladesh might also be spared a severe toll. Shah Kamal, the country’s disaster management secretary, said only a few deaths had been reported so far, although information was still being gathered. “I have a feeling that Allah favored us this time,” he said. More than 1.2 million people in Bangladesh had been moved to shelters ahead of the storm, Mr. Kamal said, and some could start returning home as early as Saturday or Sunday. Still, many face a daunting future: Entire villages were flooded and thousands of acres of crops were damaged. In Odisha, the focus was on clearing debris. The sun was out on Saturday morning, and power saws were buzzing. In many towns, the air smelled like sawdust. The storm had weakened significantly as it moved inland in Bangladesh. “Every hour, we are clearing more roads and more power lines,” Mr. Sethi said. “All agencies are working hard to bring a sense of normalcy back to the affected areas.” He said many lessons had been learned in the fearsome cyclone that hit Odisha in 1999 and killed thousands. Many people were caught flat-footed in their homes. Some of the dead were found miles from where they had lived, dragged away by raging cascades. Puri, then and now, was one of the most vulnerable towns. It is one of Odisha’s resort destinations, right on the beach, and on Friday, it seems the eye of the storm passed right over it. Dr. B.B. Dash, head of the government hospital here, said that it had received 12 dead bodies and that most of the victims died from injuries caused by flying objects such as an asbestos sheet, a piece of glass or a rock. Nearly 200 people were injured. All around Puri, people were inspecting what the storm had done to them. “See, our house is destroyed, our boat is destroyed — what can we do?’’ said Pikki Gopi, 21, a fisherman. “We don’t have any place to work, eat or sleep. We have nothing to do.’’ Mr. Gopi said he had never seen the wind howl like it did on Friday. “It was a curse of the sea on us,’’ he said. “I do not know why the sea became angry with us. We respect the sea.’’ Nearby, an older couple lay on their backs on the floor of a badly damaged home, the roof missing in action. Some fishermen on the beach played cards, and a woman carefully dried some very wet rupee notes in the sun. Pinaki Misra, a member of Parliament from Puri, stood impatiently in a district magistrate’s office. The floor was wet and a large crowd had gathered, including some prominent people such as Mr. Misra who were pressing for recovery efforts to move faster. As the district magistrate relayed instructions to his team, Mr. Misra listed all the problems the people here were facing: The electricity grid had been knocked out, the water supply was not functioning, roads remained blocked and the mobile phone network was not working. “How can life be normal in this area?’’ he asked. But he was quick to add: “The evacuation work was done very efficiently. We hope normalcy will be restored soon.“ Shambhu Sethi’s father, Baraj, a rice farmer, was one of the relatively few who died. He stepped outside his home on Friday morning to urinate and was hit by a collapsing coconut tree. “He cried but nobody could hear him,” Mr. Sethi said. When the family found Baraj 15 minutes later, he was dead. “What can I do? I am helpless, I couldn’t save him,” Mr. Sethi said. “It was none of his fault — that was our fate. This is nature’s curse on my family.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘The Wrong Mine for the Wrong Place’,"A proposed Alaskan mine threatens the planet’s largest spawning ground for sockeye salmon and lays bare Trump's gaslighting of American sportsmen. The writers are anglers and authors who have fished extensively throughout Alaska. Every creature deserves a chance to spawn. Consider the scene above, captured on Instagram. The fish is a sockeye salmon. It is on its way to its breeding grounds in Alaska’s wild interior. It has been intercepted — for a few minutes — by an angler who has come to America’s 49th state to partake in the fantastically abundant spectacle of tens of millions of salmon surging upstream to make a next generation. The angler has brought his own offspring to marvel alongside him. But all this joyful happiness, this celebration of abundant life-continuing-life, is in imminent danger of ruination. The angler holding the fish is Donald Trump Jr. The child is Donald Trump III, or D3 as his father likes to tag him on Instagram. Thanks to D1, the pater familias of the happy fishing duo pictured above, this immensely valuable fish faces a fast-approaching savaging. The means of that savaging is the proposed open-pit copper and gold Pebble Mine that would be dug at the headwaters of the sockeye salmon’s largest remaining spawning ground. The project was effectively dead at the end of the Obama administration. But thanks to a reversal engineered by Scott Pruitt, the disgraced former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the permitting process is rushing forward on a scaled-back proposal that would still be disastrous. This despite high profile Republican voices of opposition. Even Ted Stevens, the longtime and often industry-friendly Republican senator from Alaska who died in a 2010 plane crash en route to a fishing lodge, said of the Pebble Mine, “I am not opposed to mining, but it is the wrong mine for the wrong place."" The 40,000-square-mile Bristol Bay watershed that would be affected by the Pebble Mine is home to a fishery that, in recent years, has supported some 14,000 jobs and generated some $1.5 billion annually in sales value. All that stands between this thriving fishery and its despoiling is a go-ahead from the gung-ho Trump administration and the pro-development state government. First, though, the public, including outdoor sportsmen, has a chance to weigh in on this deeply anti-wilderness plan in a comment period that ends June 29. It would be beyond the scope of this short essay to detail all the ins and outs of the Pebble project. (All four of us fisherman-authors have followed this story closely for over a decade.) Suffice it to say that Pebble would be an out-of-place industrial juggernaut, financed by a Canadian mining company, to dig an enormous gold and copper mine (1.3 miles long by 1 mile wide and dug to a depth of 1,970 feet), replete with vast collecting ponds of sulfurous liquid waste in a roadless, earthquake-prone sweep of forest and tundra in Southwest Alaska. Five years ago, Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, warned after three years of study that the Pebble Mine “would likely have significant and irreversible negative impacts on the Bristol Bay watershed and its abundant salmon fisheries.” But in 2017, the Trump administration reversed course and opened the way for the mine now under consideration. This move has been opposed by Democrats and Republicans alike. Ms. McCarthy’s predecessors from the Nixon, Reagan and two Bush administrations denounced the administration’s actions on Pebble in a recent full-page ad in The Washington Post, saying: “We oppose the Trump administration’s efforts to sweep nearly a decade of science and Clean Water Act review under the rug.” The network of roads and industrial infrastructure needed to haul out the millions of tons of Pebble Mine gold and copper-laced rock would be a stake driven into the heart of Alaska’s wilderness, opening miles of untrammeled territory to exploitation. The proposed mine would store toxic mine wastes behind earthen dams. This technique has failed in the past and is even more risky for the streams and creeks upstream from Bristol Bay. The substrate surrounding the mine site is so sulfurous that the administrators of the pre-Trump Environmental Protection Agency noted in an assessment of the project that if the site were developed as the Pebble Partnership outlined it, on-site remediation would be required “in perpetuity.” In other words instead of pristine salmon runs, we’d have toxic-waste management, forever. More than all that — if more is needed — the photograph above lays bare the larger gaslighting of American sportsmen and sportswomen under President Trump. In the past two years, the real estate developer turned president has arguably done more to harm the future of hunting and fishing grounds in this country than any president in history. The rescinding of the Obama-era rule on disposal of coal tailings poses imminent risk to trout streams throughout West Virginia and other trout-rich states. The gambit to open offshore oil drilling along the East Coast and the seismic testing that would accompany such a boondoggle has the potential to damage fisheries from redfish off the Carolinas to bluefish off New England. The administration’s potential gutting of the so-called Waters of the U.S. regulations would remove federal protection for half of many states’ wetlands, which are vital for the propagation of waterfowl so many American hunters love to pursue. The mine being rushed by the Trump administration has such glaring disregard for the interests of hunters and fishers and nature lovers who back the president, that even the interests of such ardent Trump supporters as his own son and grandson are cast aside in this rush to industrialize one of the planet’s last great wild places. Also cast aside are values the angler, his son, and most American outdoor enthusiasts presumably share. Indeed it seems almost fraudulent that the present administration should brand itself with the same party affiliation as the most conserving of American conservatives, Theodore Roosevelt. Pristine salmon runs are also mines of sorts. But they are the kind of mines that provide self-renewing free sources of food, employment and recreation. As Donald Trump Jr. writes in the post that accompanies the photo above, “If you haven’t read about the journey these amazing fish make and the transformations they make in their life, you should because it’s unbelievable.” We agree. Furthermore we hope that Donald Jr. might undergo his own transformation into, dare we say it, a conservationist. If he can’t make the point abundantly clear to his father that Alaskan salmon are worth saving, maybe it’s time for him to scrub the Bristol Bay trophy shots from his social media. Pebble Mine with its slipshod dams and shortsighted planning is finite in the wealth it will bring. Hardly any of it will flow into the creels of anglers. When the dams finally break, it will be American sportsmen like Donald Trump Jr. who will taste the bitterness of all the muck that washes downstream.

2019,"‘There He Goes Again’? Not Yet, as Biden Avoids Major Gaffes","Political Memo LOS ANGELES — The mayor of Los Angeles was attempting to praise Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the press, but Mr. Biden’s aides were more focused on shooing the press away. At the end of a made-for-cameras lunch he shared with Mr. Biden at a taco stand last week, Mayor Eric Garcetti had to raise his voice over a phalanx of Biden staff members, who were attempting to end the question-and-answer session between the former vice president and about 40 reporters and photographers swarming their table. “I want to say one last thing,” the mayor twice said over the din, before offering his homage: “Los Angeles loves Joe Biden and Joe Biden loves Los Angeles.” The tape recorders and cameras were soon shut off, and Mr. Biden exited King Taco without having veered off message. As the famously voluble Mr. Biden makes his first retail campaign stops in the Democratic primary, and grows accustomed to the front-runner status he never enjoyed in his two previous White House bids, his campaign is grappling with how to showcase Mr. Biden’s never-met-a-stranger persona without exposing him to an environment where he may commit a gaffe. So far, they have struck a safe, if precarious, balance. Just over two weeks into Mr. Biden’s candidacy, the most notable feature of his campaign may be what hasn’t happened: He has not blurted anything out that delights his rivals, horrifies his aides and reinforces his image as “Uncle Joe,” America’s there-he-goes-again relative who makes you smile and wince in equal measure. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.] It is early yet — which even Mr. Biden’s friends allow as they hold their breath — and precedent offers good reason to question whether his streak of mostly error-free days can last. But his staff has sought to mitigate the risk by effectively recreating the trappings of the vice presidency: guarding question-and-answer sessions, selecting safe interview settings and remaining all but glued to his hip when he greets voters on rope lines, dips into ice cream shops and steps out of the black Chevy Suburbans that are indistinguishable from the Secret Service models he once rode in. There are notes on his lectern to remind him of key policy points, depending on the locale, and his schedule has been carefully planned: He has appeared at nearly as many fund-raisers (five) as he has rallies (six). Mr. Biden is not dodging the news media. He has taken questions from national reporters and spoken even more frequently to local print and television outlets. And he has opened his fund-raisers to press coverage. Yet that step toward transparency also doubles as a means of nudging him to stay on script. After courting danger by taking questions from donors at an appearance in South Carolina — Mr. Biden said his nickname for President Trump would be “clown” — he did not ask for audience questions at subsequent fund-raisers. Mr. Biden is hardly the only candidate to travel with an entourage and tread carefully around the news media — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for example, rarely takes press questions. And Mr. Biden’s aides feel they need to manage his appearances in part because of the sheer demand for access to a famous former vice president and the logistics of, say, moving TV cameras and boom microphones into a taco joint. Some Democrats wonder whether such a cosseted approach is sustainable for a 76-year-old candidate facing questions about his age — especially in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the famously demanding activists famously demand accessibility to presidential hopefuls. (Mr. Biden delivered speeches but did not take questions during his first trip to Iowa, though he’s expected to do so in New Hampshire this week.) [Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.] After a speech he has planned for Philadelphia this Saturday, aides say Mr. Biden will turn to delivering some policy proposals, including a foreign policy blueprint. And some of his longtime friends are urging him not to don a rhetorical straitjacket. “Handlers can ruin you,” said former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, adding fondly, “I had the best in the world.” Shortly before Mr. Biden stopped in to see him last week at his office in Las Vegas’s Bellagio casino, Mr. Reid, who is also given to malapropisms, recalled how his advisers relentlessly sought to steer his debates and news conferences — and how he was better off being his unvarnished self. “I just think that Joe Biden just needs to be himself,” Mr. Reid said in an interview. “Everybody likes him, he’s a nice guy.” (Mr. Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader, is not endorsing a candidate, but he said Mr. Biden was “in really a good position” because “people are looking for some stability.”) Mr. Biden has not been completely without Bidenisms, including two that drew attention to his age: referring to the British prime minister as Margaret Thatcher rather than Theresa May and boasting that he knew even more about foreign policy than Henry Kissinger does. In the early stages of his candidacy, though, the most powerful check on Mr. Biden has been Mr. Biden himself. To the pleasant surprise of his supporters, he has demonstrated uncharacteristic restraint in the face of temptation. When a woman yelled out, “You can hug and kiss me anytime!” at a rally near Las Vegas last week, Mr. Biden smiled, made the sign of the cross and, after a pause, simply said, “That’s nice, thank you very much.” It was a markedly different response than before he got in the race, when, in the wake of claims from women that his physical contact made them uneasy, he twice joked about hugging people during a speech to union members. And when a Biden supporter at the Taco King yelled out his encouragement across the restaurant — “kick that orange ape out of office!” a reference to the well-tanned incumbent — the former vice president not only declined to pile on, he even voiced his restraint. “I didn’t say that,” he made clear to the press scrum. He has also not taken the bait from his closest Democratic rival in the polls, Mr. Sanders, refusing to return fire when the senator has criticized him. “I will not speak ill of any of the Democratic candidates, I will not do it,” Mr. Biden said in Los Angeles. His aides believe that the intensely personal criticism he received from women last month, and the subsequent coverage about his longtime penchant for physical contact, was eye-opening for Mr. Biden. It made clear that, as front-runner, he would be under a microscope and face unrelenting scrutiny, two of his advisers said. It’s not that Mr. Biden wasn’t already aware of the hot lights of the presidential stage. His first White House bid flamed out after he was found to be borrowing from the speeches of others, and his second campaign began with self-created turmoil when he called Barack Obama the first African-American candidate for president who was “clean” and “articulate.” This time, though, Mr. Biden plainly feels chastened. He reaches for the phones of supporters when he greets them, offering selfies as often as embraces. And when he does hug a supporter, it is usually when he is asked for one or after he asks permission. Democrats who know Mr. Biden have been impressed with his discipline — but are quick to muse about how he will fare as the campaign wears on, as he grows more comfortable and perhaps less guarded. “I think they’ve been really, really adroit in the early going,” said David Axelrod, who helped lead both Obama-Biden campaigns. “Clearly, they’re trying to do enough to show the flag but not so much that it exposes him to either mistakes or fatigue. But the pace is going to quicken as the race goes on and you can’t keep him in candidate protection program.” Mr. Biden will have to become “more venturesome,” Mr. Axelrod added, “because one of the tests for a guy who’s 76 years old is, ‘Can he handle this?’” For now, Mr. Biden is avoiding risks. At King Taco, Mr. Garcetti invited two female customers to join him and his guest of honor. When the mayor asked what they did for a living, one of the women replied, “I own my spray tanning business, do you need a spray tan?” Much laughter ensued, but it was the mayor who shot back with the irresistible rejoinder. “Wrong candidate, that’s the other guy who’s already in there,” Mr. Garcetti joked about Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden stayed quiet.",The New York Times
2019,"‘There I Was, Flying Across the Room’: Tornado Leaves an Oklahoma Town Shaken","EL RENO, Okla. — Giant green dumpsters were tossed like rocks into motel rooms. Mobile homes were not just destroyed, they were shredded to scrap. Cars and trucks were spun around or flipped upside down. Doors and ceilings were ripped from walls, but picture frames, of all things, were left hanging, slightly askew. “A gust came up and our house tipped over,” said Robert Gawhega, who survived the tornado that shook his trailer the way a child shakes a toy. “There I was, flying across the room.” Severe weather in Tornado Alley on Saturday night made for a terrifying Memorial Day weekend. A brief but violent tornado tore a two-mile path through the outskirts of the Oklahoma City suburb of El Reno, demolishing much of the American Budget Value Inn motel and two of its neighbors, the Skyview mobile-home park and a car dealership. By Sunday afternoon, local officials said there had been two deaths. [Read how to stay safe and take shelter when tornadoes threaten.] Tornadoes in this part of Oklahoma have a history of being wide and long, and of carving a path of mayhem for a dozen miles or more at times. But the tornado that struck El Reno was something different: Aerial images taken by local news outlets show a short, curvy finger of destruction from a funnel that only momentarily touched down, centering much of its bite on the motel, the trailer park and the auto dealer. “It’s a pretty devastating sight at this point in time,” Mayor Matt White told reporters on Sunday morning. “Pray for our community. We’ve been through a lot here lately.” El Reno is one of several Oklahoma towns and cities that have been hard hit by widespread flooding over the past week. Runoff from powerful storms filled the Arkansas River to bursting, prompting officials to release large amounts of water from the Keystone Dam. More than 1,000 homes in Oklahoma have been damaged by flooding, officials said. One of the hardest-hit communities was the Tulsa suburb of Sand Springs, where 152 homes in a low-lying area near the river were flooded. The muddy waters rose just below some mailboxes and over the tops of others in the Town and Country neighborhood. In other areas, a small army of rescue workers were busy on Saturday and Sunday delivering supplies and helping trapped residents to safety by boat and helicopter. In Tulsa, the main concern facing officials on Sunday was the state of the city’s decades-old system of earthen levees, which have so far been holding for the most part. On Sunday in El Reno, as emergency crews continued to search through the rubble, there was a quiet sense that the town had been spared a far deadlier disaster. Officials said everyone who had been inside the motel when the tornado struck was alive and accounted for. “A lot of them hid, and a lot of them gathered up down below,” Mayor White said of the motel guests. The two people who died were from the Skyview trailer park. Late Sunday afternoon, Mr. White said the final grid search through the debris of the trailer park and the motel had been completed, with no more victims found and none expected. But some of the nearly 30 people who were injured remained hospitalized in serious or critical condition, he said. “We could have absolutely seen a lot more destruction and death,” he said. “We feel blessed. I’ve been strong to this point, but I’m getting ready to break. We can’t have any more rain. I think the measurements showed that we had a little under 18 inches of rain in the last 31 days in El Reno, Oklahoma. We just need a little break.” Forecasters with the National Weather Service in nearby Norman said that, based on a survey of the damage, the tornado was an EF-3 on the enhanced Fujita scale, with peak winds from 136 to 165 miles an hour. (EF-5 is the most powerful category.) The forecasters said the tornado had been about 75 yards wide at its widest point, stayed on the ground for 2.2 miles and lasted only about four minutes. [Read about the nerve center in Norman, Okla., where forecasters work around the clock to track severe weather and warn the public.] It came six years, almost to the day, after El Reno was hit by another EF-3 tornado. On May 31, 2013, an unusually wide tornado barreled through the area and killed eight people. El Reno is a working-class, largely rural suburb of nearly 17,000 people about 25 miles west of Oklahoma City. Cattle graze in the greenery on the sides of the highways, beneath billboards for oil field services companies. More than a few residents keep horses in their yards. The skyline of El Reno is dominated by grain silos, the tallest structures in a town whose history traces back to the establishment in 1874 of Fort Reno, a frontier Army post. Tornado sirens blared in the town at 10:27 p.m. on Saturday, the mayor said. Four minutes later the tornado struck, damaging the southeastern section of the town near Interstate 40. A television news reporter, Aaron Brilbeck of the local CBS affiliate, KWTV News 9, showed the power of the storm as it came through the town, posting on Twitter: “The hotel across the street from us was leveled. Victims are being pulled from the rubble.” At a convenience store called Domino across the street from the motel, the assistant manager, Jeffrey Pointer, said the evening had started quietly, with just a sprinkle of rain. “But then it started pouring,” he said. “The rain was blowing sideways. You couldn’t see anything.” The wind blew so hard that the windows started shaking. The power cut off, Mr. Pointer said, and an emergency generator kicked on. Then, as quickly as it had started, the roaring wind abated, leaving only rain in its wake. The phones in the store started ringing, he said, with callers asking if everyone in the store was all right. Then people started walking in the door, drenched. Some had no shirts, Mr. Pointer said. Some were injured. He said a man came to him with his arm bleeding. “He said: ‘Can you call me an ambulance? I’m hurt real bad,’” Mr. Pointer said. At the Skyview trailer park, neither Mr. Gawhega nor his aunt, who was asleep in the trailer at the time, was injured. The mobile home was pushed onto its side. Hours later, Mr. Gawhega, who is in his late 60s, went to El Reno’s chapter headquarters of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, where survivors from the motel and the trailer park slept on American Red Cross cots in the ballroom. Mr. Gawhega, an elder with the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Nations who walks with a cane, wore his Oklahoma State University sweats — he is a retired campus groundskeeper — as he walked around the low brick building. More than a century ago, before El Reno was founded, one of the chiefs prayed for the ground to be safe from tornadoes, Mr. Gawhega said, and since then tornadoes have often skirted the edges of El Reno rather than hitting it directly. He said he was grateful to have survived the storm. “The spirits are protecting it,” Mr. Gawhega said of the town. He said he was grateful to the spirits as well: “I am just glad to be alive.” Sofia Heck, another resident of the mobile-home park, said she and her boyfriend were on a date nearby when the tornado hit. Her teenage sons were at home alone. She had spoken with them on the phone during the storm, but feared for their safety and rushed back home, only to find the roads blocked with debris. Police officers stopped her from going in one entrance, but she sneaked in through another. Her children were safe, and her home had only minor damage. “I’d had no idea,” Ms. Heck said, choking back tears. “That could have been the last time I saw them.” Nancy Salsman, auxiliary president of the El Reno V.F.W., said on Sunday that there were 25 people taking shelter inside, many of them still sleeping after having been up all night. She said they had arrived quietly, and nearly expressionless. “I think they’re in shock,” Ms. Salsman said. “Some of them lost everything.”",The New York Times
2019,‘They Came to Kill.’ Almost 5 Die Daily at Hands of Rio Police.,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Shooting from helicopters, armored personnel carriers or at close range, police officers in Rio de Janeiro have gunned down 558 people during the first four months of the year — the highest number in this period since the state began keeping records more than two decades ago. This recent spike comes after years in which the federal and local authorities put in place policies that significantly diminished police killings. But as the country dove into a deep economic and political crisis in 2014, resources for security programs dried up. Criminal gangs reclaimed lost territory in Rio, and across Brazil violence exploded: More than 51,500 people were killed last year. Voters went to the polls in October and gave their support to candidates who promised to fight violence with violence by relaxing gun ownership rules and allowing the police to fire on armed suspects. The number of people killed by the police in Rio de Janeiro jumped in 2018 to a high of 1,538, according to state statistics. If killings continue this year at the current pace — nearly five a day — that record will be beat. The state’s newly elected governor, Wilson Witzel, pointed to an overall drop in homicides to argue that the approach was working. “We’re on the right track,” Mr. Witzel wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, celebrating the drop in homicides and other crimes. “We’re going to continue preserving the lives and liberty of our families.” President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, had promised to give the police more leeway to kill suspected criminals, repeating a popular saying that a “good criminal was a dead criminal.” Mr. Witzel, a former federal judge, endorsed tactics that legal experts say amount to extrajudicial killings. Soon after he was elected, Mr. Witzel said police officers should be authorized to open fire on any criminal seen carrying a rifle. “The police will do the right thing: Aim at their little heads and fire! So there is no mistake,” he told a local newspaper in November. He seemed to relish in the prospect of a rising body count, saying in January that there would be no shortage of places to send criminals. “We’ll dig graves,” he said. In March, Mr. Witzel announced that snipers deployed covertly across the state were gunning down armed suspects who “have to be lethally neutralized.” But some local lawmakers and activists in communities that have been the targets of violent police operations say officers are routinely carrying out extrajudicial killings. “Summary executions are being carried out in favelas and other peripheral areas,” said Renata Souza, a state representative who urged the United Nations and the Organization of American States to investigate. “It is a barbaric state policy that amounts to genocide.” Prosecutors acknowledge that they do not have the personnel or resources to investigate more than a small fraction of such cases thoroughly. The state prosecutor’s office created a task force in 2015 to investigate allegations of excessive force. Since then, the police have killed more than 4,000 people in the state. The unit has charged 72 officers with homicide; of those, at least 19 have been acquitted and none are in prison. Paulo Roberto Cunha, a leader of the task force, said his team faced a crushing workload, deficient forensic investigations and the reluctance of many witnesses who fear police retaliation. While the police in Rio de Janeiro are required by law to record events from cameras installed in patrol cars, the devices have vanished from the vast majority of vehicles, depriving investigators of critical evidence. In 2017, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights condemned Brazil as failing to investigate questionable police killings and ordered the country to do so. But the stacks of case files piled up on Mr. Cunha’s desk — and in filing cabinets outside his door — underscore the vastness of the challenge. There are 14 prosecutors in the task force. Rio de Janeiro has long been an immensely complex state to police. Dozens of districts settled by squatters decades ago, and long neglected by the state, are controlled by drug traffickers and paramilitary groups. Young men with semiautomatic rifles guard entry points to several communities. The police typically enter only to carry out raids — and often leave bodies in their wake, according to residents. Soon after the first shots rang out in the hilly Fallet-Fogueteiro district near downtown Rio on the morning of Feb. 8, it became clear to residents that this was no ordinary shootout in an area where rival gangs have long fought for dominance. As an elite police squad rumbled up the hill, passing murals that have been defaced with graffiti paying homage to a dominant drug gang, a group of suspected traffickers scurried into a house. They took their shirts off — a gesture that signaled they were surrendering, according to residents. Among them was Felipe Guilherme Antunes, 21. He peeled off the black T-shirt he had put on that morning, which said “Black Is Beautiful,” and waited. By the time the hail of bullets ceased, nine men lay on the ground in puddles of blood, and four others were gunned down outside. Police officials at the time said they were acting in self-defense. But as relatives and human rights investigators pored over witness accounts, autopsy reports and photos of the bodies and the house’s blood-splattered walls, many grew convinced that the men had been executed. None of the officers in the raid were wounded. According to Human Rights Watch, which examined nine of the autopsies, some of the bodies had shots to the head or the heart. “They didn’t come to take them into custody,” said Tatiana Antunes de Carvalho, the mother of Mr. Antunes, who said his wounds did not match the autopsy description. “They came to kill.” Governor Witzel and senior state police officials turned down repeated requests for interviews. In a short statement, the Police Department said it “obeys all protocols in its actions and acts according to law, including in the realm of investigations.” In early May, another police operation — which started with the police shooting down from a helicopter — left eight people dead in the sprawling Complexo da Maré favela. Activists from the community group Redes da Maré guided public defenders to a house where four of the men had been killed. An elderly woman told them she had seen two men surrender to police officers in an alley, only to be told by one officer: “My order is to kill.” The officer shot the two men, dashed into a nearby house and killed two others on a roof terrace. Public defenders entered the house and saw the remnants of bloods stains that residents had scrubbed. They saw no point in trying to preserve the scene, a public defender, Daniel Lozoya, said as he left the home. “They knew it wouldn’t be investigated,” he said. “The police officers took away the bodies.” Children and other bystanders are often caught in the crossfire: In March, 12-year-old Kauan Peixoto was shot three times. In April, a 16-year-old girl was shot in the back seat of a car. In May, a 27-year-old motorcycle driver was killed during a police shooting in the Rocinha district. Empowering the police to kill more easily has never reduced violence, said Roberto Sá, who oversaw security policy in the state from 2016 to 2018 and served in an elite police unit earlier in his career. “Confrontation generates an unsafe environment, mental illness and stress for police officers and residents,” he said.

2019,‘They Were Conned’: How Reckless Loans Devastated a Generation of Taxi Drivers,"The phone call that ruined Mohammed Hoque’s life came in April 2014 as he began another long day driving a New York City taxi, a job he had held since emigrating from Bangladesh nine years earlier. The call came from a prominent businessman who was selling a medallion, the coveted city permit that allows a driver to own a yellow cab instead of working for someone else. If Mr. Hoque gave him $50,000 that day, he promised to arrange a loan for the purchase. After years chafing under bosses he hated, Mr. Hoque thought his dreams of wealth and independence were coming true. He emptied his bank account, borrowed from friends and hurried to the man’s office in Astoria, Queens. Mr. Hoque handed over a check and received a stack of papers. He signed his name and left, eager to tell his wife. Mr. Hoque made about $30,000 that year. He had no idea, he said later, that he had just signed a contract that required him to pay $1.7 million. Over the past year, a spate of suicides by taxi drivers in New York City has highlighted in brutal terms the overwhelming debt and financial plight of medallion owners. All along, officials have blamed the crisis on competition from ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft. But a New York Times investigation found much of the devastation can be traced to a handful of powerful industry leaders who steadily and artificially drove up the price of taxi medallions, creating a bubble that eventually burst. Over more than a decade, they channeled thousands of drivers into reckless loans and extracted hundreds of millions of dollars before the market collapsed. These business practices generated huge profits for bankers, brokers, lawyers, investors, fleet owners and debt collectors. The leaders of nonprofit credit unions became multimillionaires. Medallion brokers grew rich enough to buy yachts and waterfront properties. One of the most successful bankers hired the rap star Nicki Minaj to perform at a family party. But the methods stripped immigrant families of their life savings, crushed drivers under debt they could not repay and engulfed an industry that has long defined New York. More than 950 medallion owners have filed for bankruptcy, according to a Times analysis of court records. Thousands more are barely hanging on. The practices were strikingly similar to those behind the housing market crash that led to the 2008 global economic meltdown: Banks and loosely regulated private lenders wrote risky loans and encouraged frequent refinancing; drivers took on debt they could not afford, under terms they often did not understand. Some big banks even entered the taxi industry in the aftermath of the housing crash, seeking a new market, with new borrowers. The combination of easy money, eager borrowers and the lure of a rare asset helped prices soar far above what medallions were really worth. Some industry leaders fed the frenzy by purposefully overpaying for medallions in order to inflate prices, The Times found. Between 2002 and 2014, the price of a medallion rose to more than $1 million from $200,000, even though city records showed that driver incomes barely changed. About 4,000 drivers bought medallions in that period, records show. They were excited to buy, but they were enticed by a dubious premise. $1 million 0.5 0 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 $1 million 0.5 0 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 $1 million 0.5 0 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Individual sale 60-day moving average $1 million 0.5 0 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’10 ’15 By Scott Reinhard | Source: New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission “The whole thing was like a Ponzi scheme because it totally depended on the value going up,” said Haywood Miller, a debt specialist who has consulted for both borrowers and lenders. “The part that wasn’t fair was the guy who’s buying is an immigrant, maybe someone who couldn’t speak English. They were conned.” After the medallion market collapsed, Mayor Bill de Blasio opted not to fund a bailout, and earlier this year, the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, shut down the committee overseeing the taxi industry, saying it had completed most of its work. Over 10 months, The Times interviewed 450 people, built a database of every medallion sale since 1995 and reviewed thousands of individual loans and other documents, including internal bank records and confidential profit-sharing agreements. The investigation found example after example of drivers trapped in exploitative loans, including hundreds who signed interest-only loans that required them to pay exorbitant fees, forfeit their legal rights and give up almost all their monthly income, indefinitely. A Pakistani immigrant who thought he was just buying a car ended up with a $780,000 medallion loan that left him unable to pay rent. A Bangladeshi immigrant said he was told to lie about his income on his loan application; he eventually lost his medallion. A Haitian immigrant who worked to exhaustion to make his monthly payments discovered he had been paying only interest and went bankrupt. It is unclear if the practices violated any laws. But after reviewing The Times’s findings, experts said the methods were among the worst that have been used since the housing crash. “I don’t think I could concoct a more predatory scheme if I tried,” said Roger Bertling, the senior instructor at Harvard Law School’s clinic on predatory lending and consumer protection. “This was modern-day indentured servitude.” Lenders developed their techniques in New York but spread them to Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and elsewhere, transforming taxi industries across the United States. In interviews, lenders denied wrongdoing. They noted that regulators approved their practices, and said some borrowers made poor decisions and assumed too much debt. They said some drivers were happy to use climbing medallion values as collateral to take out cash, and that those who sold their medallions at the height of the market made money. The lenders said they believed medallion values would keep increasing, as they almost always had. No one, they said, could have predicted Uber and Lyft would emerge to undercut the business. “People love to blame banks for things that happen because they’re big bad banks,” said Robert Familant, the former head of Progressive Credit Union, a small nonprofit that specialized in medallion loans. “We didn’t do anything, in my opinion, other than try to help small businesspeople become successful.” Mr. Familant made about $30 million in salary and deferred payouts during the bubble, including $4.8 million in bonuses and incentives in 2014, the year it burst, according to disclosure forms. Meera Joshi, who joined the Taxi and Limousine Commission in 2011 and became chairwoman in 2014, said it was not the city’s job to regulate lending. But she acknowledged that officials saw red flags and could have done something. “There were lots of players, and lots of people just watched it happen. So the T.L.C. watched it happen. The lenders watched it happen. The borrowers watched it happen as their investment went up, and it wasn’t until it started falling apart that people started taking action and pointing fingers,” said Ms. Joshi, who left the commission in March. “It was a party. Why stop it?” Every day, about 250,000 people hail a New York City yellow taxi. Most probably do not know they are participating in an unconventional economic system about as old as the Empire State Building. The city created taxi medallions in 1937. Unlicensed cabs crowded city streets, so officials designed about 12,000 specialized tin plates and made it illegal to operate a taxi without one bolted to the hood of the car. The city sold each medallion for $10. People who bought medallions could sell them, just like any other asset. The only restriction: Officials designated roughly half as “independent medallions” and eventually required that those always be owned by whoever was driving that cab. Over time, as yellow taxis became symbols of New York, a cutthroat industry grew around them. A few entrepreneurs obtained most of the nonindependent medallions and built fleets that controlled the market. They were family operations largely based in the industrial neighborhoods of Hell’s Kitchen in Manhattan and Long Island City in Queens. Allegations of corruption, racism and exploitation dogged the industry. Some fleet bosses were accused of cheating drivers. Some drivers refused to go outside Manhattan or pick up black and Latino passengers. Fleet drivers typically worked 60 hours a week, made less than minimum wage and received no benefits, according to city studies. Still, driving could serve as a path to the middle class. Drivers could save to buy an independent medallion, which would increase their earnings and give them an asset they could someday sell for a retirement nest egg. Those who borrowed money to buy a medallion typically had to submit a large down payment and repay within five to 10 years. The conservative lending strategy produced modest returns. The city did not release new medallions for almost 60 years, and values slowly climbed, hitting $100,000 in 1985 and $200,000 in 1997. “It was a safe and stable asset, and it provided a good life for those of us who were lucky enough to buy them,” said Guy Roberts, who began driving in 1979 and eventually bought medallions and formed a fleet. “Not an easy life, but a good life.” “And then,” he said, “everything changed.” Before coming to America, Mohammed Hoque lived comfortably in Chittagong, a city on Bangladesh’s southern coast. He was a serious student and a gifted runner, despite a small and stocky frame. His father and grandfather were teachers; he said he surpassed them, becoming an education official with a master’s degree in management. He supervised dozens of schools and traveled on a government-issued motorcycle. In 2004, when he was 33, he married Fouzia Mahabub. That same year, several of his friends signed up for the green card lottery, and their thirst for opportunity was contagious. He applied, and won. His wife had an uncle in Jamaica, Queens, so they went there. They found a studio apartment. Mr. Hoque wanted to work in education, but he did not speak enough English. A friend recommended the taxi industry. It was an increasingly common move for South Asian immigrants. In 2005, about 40 percent of New York cabbies were born in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan, according to the United States Census Bureau. Over all, just 9 percent were born in the United States. Mr. Hoque joined Taxifleet Management, a large fleet run by the Weingartens, a Russian immigrant family whose patriarchs called themselves the “Three Wise Men.” He worked 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., six days a week. On a good day, he said, he brought home $100. He often felt lonely on the road, and he developed back pain from sitting all day and diabetes, medical records show. He could have worked fewer shifts. He also could have moved out of the studio. But he drove as much as feasible and spent as little as possible. He had heard the city would soon be auctioning off new medallions. He was saving to buy one. In the early 2000s, a new generation took power in New York’s cab industry. They were the sons of longtime industry leaders, and they had new ideas for making money. Few people represented the shift better than Andrew Murstein. Mr. Murstein was the grandson of a Polish immigrant who bought one of the first medallions, built one of the city’s biggest fleets and began informally lending to other buyers in the 1970s. Mr. Murstein attended business school and started his career at Bear Stearns and Salomon Brothers, the investment banks. When he joined the taxi business, he has said, he pushed his family to sell off many medallions and to establish a bank to focus on lending. Medallion Financial went public in 1996. Its motto was, “In niches, there are riches.” Dozens of industry veterans said Mr. Murstein and his father, Alvin, were among those who helped to move the industry to less conservative lending practices. The industry veterans said the Mursteins, as well as others, started saying medallion values would always rise and used that idea to focus on lending to lower-income drivers, which was riskier but more profitable. COMING IN JUNE FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES: “THE WEEKLY” ON FX AND HULU Watch a preview of our television show, “The Weekly,” which will feature The Times’ investigation of the taxi industry. Mohammad Hossain emptied his savings to buy a taxi medallion. He had no idea he had just signed away his financial freedom. The strategy began to be used by the industry’s other major lenders — Progressive Credit Union, Melrose Credit Union and Lomto Credit Union, all family-run nonprofits that made essentially all their money from medallion loans, according to financial disclosures. “We didn’t want to be the one left behind,” said Monte Silberger, Lomto’s controller and then chief financial officer from 1999 to 2017. The lenders began accepting smaller down payments. By 2013, many medallion buyers were not handing over any down payment at all, according to an analysis of buyer applications submitted to the city. “It got to a point where we didn’t even check their income or credit score,” Mr. Silberger said. “It didn’t matter.” Lenders also encouraged existing borrowers to refinance and take out more money when medallion prices rose, according to interviews with dozens of borrowers and loan officers. There is no comprehensive data, but bank disclosures suggest that thousands of owners refinanced. Industry veterans said it became common for owners to refinance to buy a house or to put children through college. “You’d walk into the bank and walk out 30 minutes later with an extra $200,000,” said Lou Bakalar, a broker who arranged loans. Some pointed to the refinancing to argue that irresponsible borrowers fueled the crisis. “Medallion owners were misusing it,” said Aleksey Medvedovskiy, a fleet owner who also worked as a broker. “They used it as an A.T.M.” As lenders loosened standards, they increased returns. Rather than raising interest rates, they made borrowers pay a mix of costs — origination fees, legal fees, financing fees, refinancing fees, filing fees, fees for paying too late and fees for paying too early, according to a Times review of more than 500 loans included in legal cases. Many lenders also made borrowers split their loan and pay a much higher rate on the second loan, documents show. Lenders also extended loan lengths. Instead of requiring repayment in five or 10 years, they developed deals that lasted as long as 50 years, locking in decades of interest payments. And some wrote interest-only loans that could continue forever. “We couldn’t figure out why the company was doing so many interest-only loans,” said Michelle Pirritano, a Medallion Financial loan analyst from 2007 to 2011. “It was a good revenue stream, but it didn’t really make sense as a loan. I mean, it wasn’t really a loan, because it wasn’t being repaid.” Almost every loan reviewed by The Times included a clause that spiked the interest rate to as high as 24 percent if it was not repaid in three years. Lenders included the clause — called a “balloon” — so that borrowers almost always had to extend the loan, possibly at a higher rate than in the original terms, and with additional fees. Yvon Augustin was caught in one of those loans. He bought a medallion in 2006, a decade after emigrating from Haiti. He said he paid $2,275 every month — more than half his income, he said — and thought he was paying off the loan. But last year, his bank used the balloon to demand that he repay everything. That is when he learned he had been paying only the interest, he said. Mr. Augustin, 69, declared bankruptcy and lost his medallion. He lives off assistance from his children. During the global financial crisis, Eugene Haber, a lawyer for the taxi industry, started getting calls from bankers he had never met. Mr. Haber had written a template for medallion loans in the 1970s. By 2008, his thick mustache had turned white, and he thought he knew everybody in the industry. Suddenly, new bankers began calling his suite in a Long Island office park. Capital One, Signature Bank, New York Commercial Bank and others wanted to issue medallion loans, he said. Some of the banks were looking for new borrowers after the housing market collapsed, Mr. Haber said. “They needed somewhere else to invest,” he said. He said he represented some banks at loan signings but eventually became embittered because he believed banks were knowingly lending to people who could not repay. Instead of lending directly, the big banks worked through powerful industry players. They enlisted large fleet owners and brokers — especially Neil Greenbaum, Richard Chipman, Savas Konstantinides, Roman Sapino and Basil Messados — to use the banks’ money to lend to medallion buyers. In return, the owners and brokers received a cut of the monthly payments and sometimes an additional fee. The fleet owners and brokers, who technically issued the loans, did not face the same scrutiny as banks. “They did loans that were frankly insane,” said Larry Fisher, who from 2003 to 2016 oversaw medallion lending at Melrose Credit Union, one of the biggest lenders originally in the industry. “It contributed to the price increases and put a lot of pressure on the rest of us to keep up.” Still, Mr. Fisher said, Melrose followed lending rules. “A lot of people tend to blame others for their own misfortune,” he said. “If they want to blame the lender for the medallion going down the tubes the way it has, I think they’re misplaced.” Mr. Konstantinides, a fleet owner and the broker and lender who arranged Mr. Hoque’s loans, said every loan issued by his company abided by federal and state banking guidelines. “I am very sympathetic to the plight of immigrant families who are seeking a better life in this country and in this city,” said Mr. Konstantinides, who added that he was also an immigrant. Walter Rabin, who led Capital One’s medallion lending division between 2007 and 2012 and has led Signature Bank’s medallion lending division since, said he was one of the industry’s most conservative lenders. He said he could not speak for the brokers and fleet owners with whom he worked. Mr. Rabin and other Signature executives denied fault for the market collapse and blamed the city for allowing ride-hail companies to enter with little regulation. “It’s the City of New York that took the biggest advantage of the drivers,” said Joseph J. DePaolo, the president and chief executive of Signature. “It’s not the banks.” New York Commercial Bank said in a statement that it began issuing medallion loans before the housing crisis and that they were a very small part of its business. The bank did not engage in risky lending practices, a spokesman said. Mr. Messados said in an interview that he disagreed with interest-only loans and other one-sided terms. But he said he was caught between banks developing the loans and drivers clamoring for them. “They were insisting on this,” he said. “What are you supposed to do? Say, ‘I’m not doing the sale?’” Several lenders challenged the idea that borrowers were unsophisticated. They said that some got better deals by negotiating with multiple lenders at once. Mr. Greenbaum, Mr. Chipman and Mr. Sapino declined to comment, as did Capital One. Some fleet owners worked to manipulate prices. In the most prominent example, Evgeny Freidman, a brash Russian immigrant who owned so many medallions that some called him “The Taxi King,” said he purposefully overpaid for medallions sold at city auctions. He reasoned that the higher prices would become the industry standard, making the medallions he already owned worth more. Mr. Freidman, who was partners with Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, disclosed the plan in a 2012 speech at Yeshiva University. He recently pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud. He declined to comment. As medallion prices kept increasing, the industry became strained. Drivers had to work longer hours to make monthly payments. Eventually, loan records show, many drivers had to use almost all their income on payments. “The prices got to be ridiculous,” said Vincent Sapone, the retired manager of the League of Mutual Taxi Owners, an owner association. “When it got close to $1 million, nobody was going to pay that amount of money, unless they came from another country. Nobody from Brooklyn was going to pay that.” Some drivers have alleged in court that lenders tricked them into signing loans. Muhammad Ashraf, a Pakistani immigrant, alleged that a broker, Heath Candero, duped him into a $780,000 interest-only loan. He said in an interview in Urdu that he could not speak English fluently and thought he was just signing a loan to buy a car. He said he found out about the loan when his bank sued him for not fully repaying. The bank eventually decided not to pursue a case against Mr. Ashraf. He also filed a lawsuit against Mr. Candero. That case was dismissed. A lawyer for Mr. Candero declined to comment. Abdur Rahim, a Bangladeshi immigrant, alleged that his lender, Bay Ridge Credit Union, inserted hidden fees. In an interview, he added he was told to lie on his loan application. The application, reviewed by The Times, said he made $128,389, but he said his tax return showed he made about $25,000. In court, Bay Ridge has denied there were hidden fees and said Mr. Rahim was “confusing the predatory-lending statute with a mere bad investment.” The credit union declined to comment. Several employees of lenders said they were pushed to write loans, encouraged by bonuses and perks such as tickets to sporting events and free trips to the Bahamas. They also said drivers almost never had lawyers at loan closings. Borrowers instead trusted their broker to represent them, even though, unbeknown to them, the broker was often getting paid by the bank. Stan Zurbin, who between 2009 and 2012 did consulting work for a lender that issued medallion loans, said that as prices rose, lenders in the industry increasingly lent to immigrants. “They didn’t have 750 credit scores, let’s just say,” he said. “A lot of them had just come into the country. A lot of them just had no idea what they were signing.” Mrs. Hoque did not want her husband to buy a medallion. She wanted to use their savings to buy a house. They had their first child in 2008, and they planned to have more. They needed to leave the studio apartment, and she thought a home would be a safer investment. But Mr. Hoque could not shake the idea, especially after several friends bought medallions at the city’s February 2014 auction. One friend introduced him to a man called “Big Savas.” It was Mr. Konstantinides, a fleet owner who also had a brokerage and a lending company, Mega Funding. The call came a few weeks later. A medallion owner had died, and the family was selling for $1 million. Mr. Hoque said he later learned the $50,000 he paid up front was just for taxes. Mega eventually requested twice that amount for fees and a down payment, records show. Mr. Hoque said he maxed out credit cards and borrowed from a dozen friends and relatives. Fees and interest would bring the total repayment to more than $1.7 million, documents show. It was split into two loans, both issued by Mega with New York Commercial Bank. The loans made him pay $5,000 a month — most of the $6,400 he could earn as a medallion owner. After paying his two medallion loans and business costs, Mr. Hoque had about $1,400 left over each month to pay the rent on his studio apartment in Queens and cover his living expenses.

All other costs are estimates based on Mr. Hoque’s records and industry averages as of 2014. Mr. Konstantinides said in his statement that lenders disclosed all the fees to Mr. Hoque and encouraged him to consult with a lawyer and accountant. “Mr. Hoque had extensive experience and knowledge of the taxi industry,” he said. By the time the deal closed in July 2014, Mr. Hoque had heard of a new company called Uber. He wondered if it would hurt the business, but nobody seemed to be worried. As Mr. Hoque drove to the Taxi and Limousine Commission’s downtown office for final approval of the purchase, he fantasized about becoming rich, buying a big house and bringing his siblings to America. After a commission official reviewed his application and loan records, he said he was ushered into the elegant “Taxi of Tomorrow” room. An official pointed a camera. Mr. Hoque smiled. In late 2012, Andrew Murstein appeared on the Fox Business Network to talk about medallions. “These are little cash cows running around the city spitting out money,” Mr. Murstein said, beaming in a navy suit and pink tie. He did not mention he was quietly leaving the business, a move that would benefit him when the market collapsed. By the time of the appearance, Medallion Financial had been cutting the number of medallion loans on its books for years, according to disclosures it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Murstein later said the company started exiting the business and focusing on other ventures before 2010. Mr. Murstein declined numerous interview requests. He also declined to answer some written questions, including why he promoted medallions while exiting the business. In emails and through a spokesman, he acknowledged that Medallion Financial reduced down payments but said it rarely issued interest-only loans or charged borrowers for repaying loans too early. “Many times, we did not match what our competitors were willing to do and in retrospect, thankfully, we lost the business,” he wrote to The Times. Interviews with three former staffers, and a Times review of loan documents that were filed as part of lawsuits brought by Medallion Financial against borrowers, indicate the company issued many interest-only loans and routinely included a provision allowing it to charge borrowers for repaying loans too early. Other lenders also left the taxi industry or took precautions long before the market collapsed. The credit unions specializing in the industry kept making new loans. But between 2010 and 2014, they sold the loans to other financial institutions more often than in the previous five years, disclosure forms show. Progressive Credit Union, run by Mr. Familant, sold loans off almost twice as often, the forms show. By 2012, that credit union was selling the majority of the loans it issued. In a statement, Mr. Familant said the selling of loans was a standard banking practice that did not indicate a lack of confidence in the market. Several banks used something called a confession of judgment. It was an obscure document in which the borrower admitted defaulting on the loan — even before taking out any money at all — and authorized the bank to do whatever it wanted to collect. Congress has banned that practice in consumer loans, but not in business loans, which is how lenders classified medallion deals. Many states have barred it in business loans, too, but New York is not among them. Even as some lenders quietly braced for the market to fall, prices kept rising, and profits kept growing. By 2014, many of the people who helped create the bubble had made millions of dollars and invested it elsewhere. Medallion Financial started focusing on lending to R.V. buyers and bought a professional lacrosse team and a Nascar team, painting the car to look like a taxi. Mr. Murstein and his father made more than $42 million between 2002 and 2014, disclosures show. In 2015, Ms. Minaj, the rap star, performed at his son’s bar mitzvah. The Melrose C.E.O., Alan Kaufman, had the highest base salary of any large state-chartered credit union leader in America in 2013 and 2015, records show. His medallion lending supervisor, Mr. Fisher, also made millions. It is harder to tell how much fleet owners and brokers made, but in recent years news articles have featured some of them with new boats and houses. Mr. Messados’s bank records, filed in a legal case, show that by 2013, he had more than $50 million in non-taxi assets, including three homes and a yacht. The medallion bubble burst in late 2014. Uber and Lyft may have hastened the crisis, but virtually all of the hundreds of industry veterans interviewed for this article, including many lenders, said inflated prices and risky lending practices would have caused a collapse even if ride-hailing had never been invented. At the market’s height, medallion buyers were typically earning about $5,000 a month and paying about $4,500 to their loans, according to an analysis by The Times of city data and loan documents. Many owners could make their payments only by refinancing when medallion values increased, which was unsustainable, some loan officers said. City data shows that since Uber entered New York in 2011, yellow cab revenue has decreased by about 10 percent per cab, a significant bite for low-earning drivers but a small drop compared with medallion values, which initially rose and then fell by 90 percent. As values fell, borrowers asked for breaks. But many lenders went the opposite direction. They decided to leave the business and called in their loans. They used the confessions to get hundreds of judgments that would allow them to take money from bank accounts, court records show. Some tried to get borrowers to give up homes or a relative’s assets. Others seized medallions and quickly resold them for profit, while still charging the original borrowers fees and extra interest. Several drivers have alleged in court that their lenders ordered them to buy life insurance. Many lenders hired a debt collector, Anthony Medina, to seize medallions from borrowers who missed payments. Mr. Medina left notes telling borrowers they had to give the lender “relief” to get their medallions back. The notes, which were reviewed by The Times, said the seizure was “authorized by vehicle apprehension unit.” Some drivers said Mr. Medina suggested he was a police officer and made them meet him at a park at night and pay $550 extra in cash. One man, Jean Demosthenes, a 64-year-old Haitian immigrant who could not speak English, said in an interview in Haitian Creole that Mr. Medina cornered him in Midtown, displayed a gun and took his car. In an interview, Mr. Medina denied threatening anyone with a gun. He said he requested cash because drivers who had defaulted could not be trusted to write good checks. He said he met drivers at parks and referred to himself as the vehicle apprehension unit because he wanted to hide his identity out of fear he could be targeted by borrowers. “You’re taking words from people that are deadbeats and delinquent people. Of course, they don’t want to see me,” he said. “I’m not the bad guy. I’m just the messenger from the bank.” Some lenders, especially Signature Bank, have let borrowers out of their loans for one-time payments of about $250,000. But to get that money, drivers have had to find new loans. Mr. Greenbaum, a fleet owner, has provided many of those loans, sometimes at interest rates of up to 15 percent, loan documents and interviews showed. New York Commercial Bank said in its statement it also had modified some loans. Other drivers lost everything. Most of the more than 950 owners who declared bankruptcy had to forfeit their medallions. Records indicate many were bought by hedge funds hoping for prices to rise. For now, cabs sit unused. Bhairavi Desai, founder of the Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents drivers and independent owners, has asked the city to bail out owners or refund auction purchasers. Others have urged the city to pressure banks to forgive loans or soften terms. After reviewing The Times’s findings, Deepak Gupta, a former top official at the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the New York Attorney General’s Office should investigate lenders. Mr. Gupta also said the state should close the loophole that let lenders classify medallion deals as business loans, even though borrowers had to guarantee them with everything they owned. Consumer loans have far more disclosure rules and protections. “These practices were indisputably predatory and would be illegal if they were considered consumer loans, rather than business loans,” he said. Last year, amid eight known suicides of drivers, including three medallion owners with overwhelming loans, the city passed a temporary cap on ride-hailing cars, created a task force to study the industry and directed the city taxi commission to do its own analysis of the debt crisis. Earlier this year, the Council eliminated the committee overseeing the industry after its chairman, Councilman Rubén Díaz Sr. of the Bronx, said the Council was “controlled by the homosexual community.” The speaker, Mr. Johnson, said, “The vast majority of the legislative work that we have been looking at has already been completed.” In a statement, a council spokesman said the committee’s duties had been transferred to the Committee on Transportation. “The Council is working to do as much as it can legislatively to help all drivers,” the spokesman said. As of last week, no one had been appointed to the task force. On the last day of 2018, Mr. and Mrs. Hoque brought their third child home from the hospital. Mr. Hoque cleared space for the boy’s crib, pushing aside his plastic bags of T-shirts and the fan that cooled the studio. He looked around. He could not believe he was still living in the same room. His loan had quickly faltered. He could not make the payments and afford rent, and his medallion was seized. Records show he paid more than $12,000 to Mega, and he said he paid another $550 to Mr. Medina to get it back. He borrowed from friends, promising it would not happen again. Then it happened four more times, he said. Mr. Konstantinides, the broker, said in his statement that he met with Mr. Hoque many times and twice modified one of his loans in order to lower his monthly payments. He also said he gave Mr. Hoque extra time to make some payments. In all, between the initial fees, monthly payments and penalties after the seizures, Mr. Hoque had paid about $400,000 into the medallion by the beginning of this year. But he still owed $915,000 more, plus interest, and he did not know what to do. Bankruptcy would cost money, ruin his credit and remove his only income source. And it would mean a shameful end to years of hard work. He believed his only choice was to keep working and to keep paying. His cab was supposed to be his ticket to money and freedom, but instead it seemed like a prison cell. Every day, he got in before the sun rose and stayed until the sky began to darken. Mr. Hoque, now 48, tried not to think about home, about what he had given up and what he had dreamed about. “It’s an unhuman life,” he said. “I drive and drive and drive. But I don’t know what my destination is.” [Read Part 2 of The Times’s investigation: As Thousands of Taxi Drivers Were Trapped in Loans, Top Officials Counted the Money] Reporting was contributed by Emma G.

2019,"‘They’re Playing Our Song,’ Over and Over and Over Again","Ron and Staci Schnell have a special affection for Marvin Hamlisch’s romantic musical — even after seeing it 25 times. ARLINGTON, Tex. — This is a love story. It began in New York City and wended its way through eight states and 24 theaters, some of them on Broadway, before we end up at the 199-seat Theater Arlington, a few minutes from the original Six Flags Over Texas amusement park. Ron and Staci Schnell are here to see “They’re Playing Our Song,” the 25th time they’ve seen the musical together, and their first time seeing it in Texas. The Schnells love this show. It’s about a boy and girl meeting cute, falling in love, falling out of love and finding each other again before the final curtain. And this is a story of how two people — Ron and Staci Schnell (now 51 and 48) — fell in love, stayed in love and have scheduled their lives around performances of “They’re Playing Our Song” wherever they may occur. That the Schnells have seen this one musical so many times doesn’t make them peculiar; it puts them in the category now known as theater “superfans,” not dissimilar to Trekkies or Deadheads. There’s even a 2017 documentary about the type, called “Repeat Attenders.” Those fans tend to gravitate to the biggest or cultiest shows, “Wicked” or “Hedwig” or “Rent.” But that’s not what moved Ron Schnell, in 1979, when our story began. He was 13 and it was a special day: his grandma, Bernice Klein Schnell, was taking Ronnie to Broadway for the first time. She picked “They’re Playing Our Song,” at the Imperial Theater. Based on the romantic and professional history of its composer Marvin Hamlisch and its lyricist Carole Bayer Sager, the musical had a book by Neil Simon. Even better, Grandma was friendly with somebody in the ensemble. Young Ron was enchanted. He loved the music and the performances, notably Robert Klein as Vernon Gersch, the neurotic Hamlisch stand-in, and Lucie Arnaz as the free-spirited lyricist Sonia Walsk. And since his grandmother knew Hal Shane, who had a supporting role in the show, they were invited backstage and got autographs. All in all, it was a magical night. The only further thing Ron could do was to buy the cast album, which he played endlessly. And when Tony Roberts joined the cast a few years later, succeeding Mr. Klein, he saw the show again. Meanwhile he taught himself to play the score on the piano. By this point the young man from Rockland County was also teaching himself computer languages, which led to his eventual career as a software developer at some of the largest companies in silicon America. In 1991, Mr. Schnell moved to Miami, where he met Staci Lee, a graduate student in marriage and family therapy. After a reasonable amount of time, he felt he trusted her enough to share his affection for the “They’re Playing Our Song” album, which was now a fixture in his car’s 8- track player, alternating only with The Carpenters. He had faith that Staci would “get it” and therefore get him. “It’s not the most manly of shows,” he confided. They came to agree that “their” song was the second-act opener, “When You’re in My Arms.” In 1993, Ron relocated to Los Angeles for business and asked Staci to join him. But she was still studying at Nova Southeastern University and didn’t want to move in with him just like, you know. But if he was willing to wait until she finished her master’s degree, she’d agree to come for a long visit. The understanding was that a life-changing decision was imminent. “I wanted our engagement to be memorable,” Ron told me over a bowl of chips con queso at the Tipsy Oak restaurant in Arlington. “I decided if there was some way, maybe a high school was putting on the show, I could somehow find it.” This was before the internet, reader, and it wasn’t easy to research. And remember, too, that although “They’re Playing Our Song” was the couple’s favorite show, and that it ran on Broadway for 1,082 performances, Staci had never actually seen it. Mr. Schnell was undeterred. He came to learn about theater licensing, and Samuel French publishing, and discovered that there would be a production in Long Beach, Calif., in March 1994. On March 8 of that year, Ron told Staci he wanted to go to Long Beach for the evening. She didn’t know he’d done a full reconnaissance the day before, figuring out which way to approach the Long Beach Civic Light Opera theater so that Staci wouldn’t immediately see the marquee, nor that he had already filled a room at the Four Seasons Dana Point with rose petals, beauty products and contact lens solution (“So thoughtful,” Staci recalls). When she saw the sign for “They’re Playing Our Song,” she burst into tears. The proposal happened later that evening at the hotel. However, the theater, informed of Ron’s plan, gave the couple a pair of front row seats to see the production again the following Saturday night. “We sat next to [star] Jack Wagner’s mother,” Staci said, as if it were yesterday. Why seeing “They’re Playing Our Song” over and over became their thing is the one vague answer the Schnells offer. “We never actually said to each other ‘Let’s keep doing this,’” Ron said. “It was just sort of understood. I would say something like, ‘Hey, it’s playing in San Diego,’ to which Staci replied, ‘Which day do you want to go?’” The passion continued when they moved back to Florida. “The next time we saw it was when I was pregnant with our son in 1996,” Staci recalled. “It was a local production in Hollywood, Fla., close to home.” (They’ll kill me for saying so, but that 1996 version was the worst version the Schnells have seen so far.) At best, “They’re Playing Our Song” garnered mixed reviews, praised mostly for its score, which features a sprightly title song and a few other piano-bar favorites. And yet the Schnells keep on seeing it. They’ve seen it with full orchestras and just a piano accompaniment. They’ve seen it with actors on book, and with recorded music. They’ve seen it with Jack Wagner and Lorna Patterson, Jason Alexander and Stephanie J. Block, and with people who had day jobs at Home Depot. They’ve seen it in summer stock, of course, though never at a high school or dinner theater. Now the parents of two grown children, both inducted into the Frequent Viewing Club, every now and then they use revivals as a way to plan travel to various American cities. (Sometimes Ron, an expert witness on digital antitrust issues, can do some business nearby, too.) The most they’ve spent is $3,000 for tickets and travel, which got them to New York in February for a very special event: the 40th anniversary performance of “They’re Playing Our Song” with its original stars, Ms. Arnaz and Mr. Klein, as a benefit for the Actors Fund. It was there at the post-show party that I found myself sitting with a married couple from Florida, he in a black polo shirt embroidered with the logo from the original Broadway run. He had it made for himself, and he tends to wear it whenever he sees the musical. Which brings us to Texas. Here in Arlington, as we sit in the lobby as the audience wanders in, the feeling is festive. There are cafe tables and a bar serving coffee and lemonade. Members of the theater’s board come to say hello. It is opening night — the first “They’re Playing Our Song” opening the Schnells have ever attended. Steven Morris, the executive director of Theater Arlington, has directed this revival. Before joining the theater full time, he was in charge of the theater program at Lamar High School in Arlington for 27 years. The school’s theater is named after him. As the performance is about to begin, he tells the crowd about the couple that fell in love with “They’re Playing Our Song” and traveled all the way from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to see it. Murmurs ripple through the audience. The show starts. An orchestra of three plays in a cleverly designed loft above the stage. B.J. Cleveland, a local celebrity, is Vernon, 35 years after he made his Theater Arlington debut as one of the character’s singing alter egos. His Sonia is Lori Woods Blondin, the full-time head of the dance department at Lamar High. After the show, as the cast and the crowd sample the Cooper Street Bakery’s opening-night cake and the hummus and pitas donated by Prince Lebanese Grill, Staci and Ron stand to one side, being interviewed by Arlington media. “It was very, very good,” she said of the production a bit later. “The set design was outstanding,” Ron added. Business commitments will keep them from the Players of Utica production in upstate New York starting May 31. But they have a 2020 trip set: “They’re Playing Our Song” in Bay City, Mich.

2019,‘This Is All We Can Afford’: Shrinking Lives in the English Countryside,"Britain’s big squeeze In Cumbria, a bucolic landscape masks growing poverty and isolation. As bus lines are cut and services dry up under austerity, older people are feeling new constraints. Chris Harrisson, a farmer in Alston, England, checking on calves. Austerity has affected most of Britain’s rural areas, but Cumbria is particularly hard hit.CreditCreditLaetitia Vancon for The New York Times ALSTON, England — It was not until Trevor Robinson received a letter notifying him of a missed appointment at the hospital that he realized he had not spoken to another human being in more than six weeks. Mr. Robinson, a 77-year-old retired landscape gardener, had spent most of that time alone, sitting on his favorite frayed leather recliner looking out the window at the moorland surrounding his cottage in the northwestern county of Cumbria. “When you spend every second by yourself, you lose track of time,” he said as tears trickled down his face. “I feel lonely, very lonely, and bored.” Mr. Robinson’s isolation, shared by thousands of older people in Britain, is the result of a chain of cause-and-effect that stretches from rural Cumbria to the halls of power in London. He used to ride a subsidized bus to town until the local council discontinued the route. The council was responding to steep budget cutbacks stemming from the Conservative-led government’s decade-long austerity program. [Read more about what austerity is and how it has altered life for many Britons.] Even as austerity has sliced through nearly every aspect of British life, the government has protected high-profile benefits for older people, and it has raised the state pension on a more generous basis than previous administrations. But a free bus pass is of little use if buses no longer reach you, and many retired people have discovered that apparently minor cuts — the elimination of a bus route, the closing of a tiny health care center, community center or post office — can profoundly upend their lives. The effects are especially pronounced in rural areas, where the isolation of older residents has emerged as one of the greatest, and largely hidden, costs of local councils’ straitened budgets, with funding slashed by half nationwide since 2010, the National Audit Office has found. While experts say these problems are common to much of Britain’s countryside, they are particularly severe in Cumbria. Best known for its Lake District National Park and historic lakeside mansions, it is also one of the poorest rural areas in England. Twenty-nine of its communities are among the 10 percent most deprived nationwide. Household income levels trail the national average in all but one district. And by 2020, nearly a quarter of Cumbria’s residents will be over 65 — 5 percentage points higher than in 2008 and double the proportion projected for London. Half of those have long-term health problems or disabilities. Cumbria has had problems since its lead and zinc mines closed in the 1960s. But they have been amplified by austerity. This year, Cumbria County Council plans to cut about $23 million from its budget to cushion a steady drop in funding from the national government — to $17.7 million this year from nearly $200 million in 2012. By 2021, the council expects the grant to disappear entirely, despite recent declarations by Conservative Party leaders that the austerity era is over. In April last year, Cumbria put up its local council tax by 4 percent, the first rise in several years, after the government eased restrictions on such increases. “It’s always been expensive to deliver services to rural communities because the population is so spread out,” said Peter Thornton, the council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for finance. “But since the central government cuts that started in 2010 this becomes more of a challenge each year.” The council’s first major cut to services came in 2014: ending bus subsidies. It saved around 9 million pounds, around $12 million, a year, and lost about 60 percent of the area’s bus services. “But we are starting to rethink ways of providing transport,” Mr. Thornton said. “There’s increasing recognition of how these cuts have contributed to the problem of rural isolation and the impact on people’s mental health.” Bus cuts are also becoming a national issue. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, proposed last month to spend £1.3 billion, or about $1.7 billion, to restore lost services. Until recent years, the quality of life for seniors had steadily improved. From a high point in the mid-1990s, the poverty rate among older people had declined, the Joseph RowntreeFoundation says, falling to 13 percent in 2012-13 before rising to 16 percent in 2015-16. But one in six pensioners remain in poverty, and the rate has started to increase. “After positive progress, it is worrying that the number of pensioners living in poverty is once again on the rise,” said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, Britain’s largest charity working with older people. And with the slowdown in economic growth associated with Britain’s tortured withdrawal from the European Union, the government is facing renewed budgetary strains. Five years ago, Mr. Robinson used to take a bus to the city of Carlisle, about 40 minutes away, where he shopped at his favorite grocery store, Morrison’s, shot darts at a club and played cards and watched television with his best friend, Billy. That ended in 2014, with the withdrawal of bus subsidies. “I tried taking the new bus, but it only waits in Carlisle for an hour and a half before coming back,” Mr. Robinson said. “That’s just not enough time to get anything done, and if you miss the bus, you’re doomed.” Since then, Mr. Robinson has barely left the house. He spends most of his $175 weekly pension on food from the local store, which he gets a lift to once a week, and he rents a television. “I used to buy my favorite beef lasagna and fresh veg from Morrison’s,” he said. “But there’s not much choice in the village, so now I’m mainly eating instant soup.” He said he called the council to inquire about transport options to the city, but he was told, “Sorry sir, we simply do not have the funding.” Mr. Robinson draws a simple lesson from all this: “You need to be rich or upper middle class to survive in the countryside nowadays.” Two years ago, barely able to walk after he developed an infection following bunion surgery, Mr. Robinson applied for an attendance allowance, a benefit for people over 65 who are disabled. His problem was deemed not severe enough. “You pay taxes your whole life thinking the government’s going to take care of you when you’re old and dying, but their message to me was loud and clear,” he said, his voice rising. “They don’t give a damn.” Many seniors and their advocates say such rejections have grown increasingly common as welfare rules have tightened. “General benefits are a lot harder to get than 10 years ago,” said Hugh Tomlinson, the deputy C.E.O. of Age UK in South Lakeland, part of Cumbria. His clients’ rejection rate for attendance allowance, he says, has doubled in three years. “A lot of those decisions get overturned on appeal,” Mr. Tomlinson said, adding that he suspected the rejections were part of a new strategy calculating that few older people would take that step. “Our offices,” he said, “have had to convince a lot of people to appeal.” Not so long ago, Mr. Robinson and other seniors could have fallen back on their families for help with shopping and doctor’s appointments, not to speak of simple visits. But diminished job opportunities and benefit cuts have forced many rural young people to move to distant cities. Trevor Robinson’s son, Liam, had to leave a rental near Alston, about 25 minutes from his father’s house, when the authorities cut his benefits last year, saying he had not applied for enough jobs. He disputes that, and points instead to Cumbria’s budget for job seeker’s allowance, which has been cut by almost two-thirds, to $11 million in 2016-2017 from $32 million in 2009-2010. He says he also could not afford the heating bills, another major obstacle for rural residents, especially in high altitude areas like Alston. He now lives in subsidized housing in the city of Lancaster, about an hour and a half’s drive from his father. “I miss the clean air and space of the country and being able to check in on my pops,” he said. “But this is all we can afford.” Perhaps most disturbing for older residents is the shrinking health care sector, as hospitals close and doctors cluster in larger towns. This has been driven in large part by a funding formula that measures wealth partly on the number of cars per household — an absolute necessity in remote areas, but not in cities. As a result, officials say, Cumbria receives one of the lowest public health allocations per capita in the country, around $50 compared with about $235 in London. In 2016, Alston community hospital’s inpatient unit, with its seven beds, had to close because of staffing shortages caused by its isolation and lack of transport. Local residents met the decision with fierce opposition, because the beds were often the only place where the dying could spend their final days among friends and family. “I’ve seen two people there who were about to leave us,” Steve Frogley, 69, a retired electrician, said. “Now, people in that state are all the way in Carlisle or Hexham, and it’s really hard for their loved ones to go and visit them.” Carlisle and Hexham are about an hour’s drive from Alston. The N.H.S. North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group announced the permanent closing of the beds last March, saying it would treat more people at home. But many in Alston seemed unconvinced. “The hospital is sadly missed,” Mr. Frogley said. “It’s the biggest loss to the community since I’ve been here. It would have been a wonderful place to die.”",The New York Times
2019,‘This Is Unacceptable.’ Military Reports a Surge of Sexual Assaults in the Ranks,"Sexual assault in the American military surged in the last two years, driven almost entirely by a 50 percent increase in assaults on women in uniform, according to a survey released on Thursday by the Defense Department. The department’s annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military estimated that there were 20,500 instances of “unwanted sexual contact” in the 2018 fiscal year, based on a survey of men and women across the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. That was an increase of 38 percent from the previous survey in 2016. The grim data provide considerable ammunition for critics in Congress and veterans’ groups who have pressed repeatedly to change the way the military prosecutes sexual assault crimes. They want authority over such cases shifted away from military commanders and into the hands of an independent prosecutor’s office. “These aren’t just numbers, these are people’s lives,” said Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, who has pushed to remove the authority from commanders. The issue took on added political visibility in March when Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, said publicly that she had been raped by a superior officer and had suffered numerous sexual assaults while serving in the Air Force. She has opposed shifting authority over sexual assault cases away from commanders. The survey found that while assaults on men in the military remained flat, assaults on women recorded their biggest increase in years. Women now make up only about 20 percent of the military, but are the targets of 63 percent of assaults, the survey found, with the youngest and lowest-ranking women most at risk. Overall, one out of every 16 military women reported being groped, raped or otherwise sexually assaulted within the last year. “To put it bluntly, we are not performing to the standards and expectations we have for ourselves or for each other,” Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting secretary of defense, said in a message to senior military leaders this week. “This is unacceptable. We cannot shrink from facing the challenge head on.” The secretary proposed a list of actions, including better tracking and training, and a new program to identify repeat offenders even if their victims do not want to come forward. The figures come from a survey of about 100,000 active-duty troops, which the department has conducted every two years since 2006. The latest results are not the worst — assault rates were higher in both the 2006 and 2012 surveys. But the Pentagon has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into prevention efforts, education programs and resources for victims in recent years. It now has legions of sexual assault specialists and victims’ advocates, and the Army has even developed a hologram of an assault victim to help with training. Still, the report noted that the latest data suggests current strategies are not enough. “We’ve thrown about $200 million at this problem for eight to 10 years, and this report suggests it’s not working,” said Ms. Speier. Along with Senate Democrats, she has repeatedly introduced legislation that would create an independent prosecutor, but, she said, the military has always lobbied against eroding commanders’ authority, and the bills have languished. “Now people that have opposed the legislation are starting to come around,” Ms. Speier said. “People are starting to see we need to do more.” Opponents, including many in Congress, argue that military commanders are in the best position to understand individual cases, and that bringing in an outside prosecutor could tie their hands. A separate report in January showed that the number of sexual assaults at the nation’s service academies had risen by 50 percent since 2016, suggesting that the problem is just as widespread among the military’s future leaders as it is in the current ranks. It was also in line with high rates reported at civilian colleges and universities. The military-wide survey data released this week indicates that alcohol use remains a stubborn contributing factor, and was involved in 62 percent of assaults on women. Assaults increased across all branches, but the Marine Corps, which has proportionally more young, low-ranking troops and far fewer women than the other services, reported by far the highest rates. One in 10 surveyed women in the Marines reported being assaulted, twice the rate of either the Army or the Air Force. “Sexual assault erodes the trust and cohesion within the Marine Corps team, degrades our lethality and readiness, and is incompatible with our core values of honor, courage and commitment,” the Marine Corps said in a statement. “In the end, this is an issue of trust — trust that fellow Marines will look after each other.” The survey found that the rate of assaults on men in the military was much lower than on women. Overall, about one in 100 surveyed men said they had been assaulted in the last year, with the highest incidence reported in the Navy. While the survey found that troops were experiencing more assaults, they were somewhat less likely than before to report them. The reporting rate, a barometer for the troops’ confidence that the military will punish assaulters and protect victims — fell to 30 percent in fiscal 2018 from 32 percent in 2016. That’s still much better than the estimated 7 percent reporting rate in 2006, according to the new report. But Don Christensen, a retired Air Force judge and chief prosecutor, said that a large majority of victims do not trust the system. “It shows the old ways aren’t working, and it’s getting worse, not better,” said Mr. Christensen, who is now president of Protect Our Defenders, a group that advocates for military victims of sexual assault. Victims are often reluctant to come forward, he said, because “they are afraid the case won’t be handled well, and they are afraid they will be retaliated against.” He noted that, according to the latest figures, there were about 6,000 unrestricted reports of sexual assault in the military in the latest year. But at a briefing on Thursday, he said, Defense Department officials said that only about 300 cases had been prosecuted. The Pentagon’s report notes that the military took “disciplinary action” of some kind in 65 percent of cases in 2018, a slight increase from 2017. But nearly all of that punishment was meted out by commanders at their discretion outside the court system, Mr. Christensen noted, and could be as minor as a stern admonishment. “Commanders are basically being asked to practice law without a license,” he said. “It’s complicated, it takes up a lot of their time. It’s time to give this over to professionals.”",The New York Times
2019,Inside the Network of Anti-Abortion Activists Winning Across the U.S.,"State after state is passing sweeping abortion restrictions this year, from Alabama’s near total abortion ban, to Ohio’s ban after a fetal heartbeat is detected, to Utah’s ban after a pregnancy reaches 18 weeks. Already, eight states have passed laws that could challenge federal protections for abortion, with more on the way, prompting jubilation on the right and fear on the left. The laws may appear to present a united front and a coordinated political campaign. Instead they reflect a sustained effort by a network of disparate activists, each with their own strategy honed over decades of work. “It’s not like there’s some master planner out there saying, ‘This state should do this and this state should do that,’” said Samuel Lee, a longtime lobbyist for anti-abortion legislation in Missouri. “But there are some creative people out there in different states trying different things.” The anti-abortion movement, built over nearly five decades, is closer than it has ever been to its long-held dream of dismantling Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Empowered by a president who pushes their priorities, by a Supreme Court now seemingly tipped in their favor and by sheer determination, anti-abortion activists and lawmakers across the country have pushed dozens of bills into law in the past few months. The most aggressive of the anti-abortion laws that have been passed have not taken effect and are expected to face challenges in court — which in some cases was an aim of the anti-abortion activists to begin with. Perhaps more than any coordinated strategy, activists across the country are tapping into the same energy and feeding on one another’s momentum. “This is a wave that is rolling across our country in the pro-life states,” said Sue Swayze Liebel, who runs the National Pro-Life Women’s Caucus for Susan B. Anthony List. “Everybody just put the pedal down, let’s all go, everybody rushing to the finish line.” [How banning abortion in the early weeks of pregnancy became mainstream.] Ms. Liebel spent the most momentous week in years for the anti-abortion movement on the road. She started with activists in Texas, to drum up support for a bill that would ban abortion on the basis of race, sex or disability. By Wednesday, she was at the Missouri Statehouse to champion a bill that would ban abortions after the eighth week of pregnancy. By the end of the week, she was cheering friends like State Representative Mary Elizabeth Coleman of Missouri, an architect of the bill, as it passed the Legislature. The movement’s grass-roots networks can be hard to define. Activists are more likely to coordinate through their Catholic and evangelical churches than on mass political listservs or email chains. In some states the local Right to Life chapter may be the strongest activist hub. In others, it might be the Concerned Women for America chapter, or the regional Family Policy Council group. The activists do not often agree on whether their priority should be to pass a six-week ban or a 20-week one. But together, their efforts have magnified the voices of millions of Americans who want abortion to be illegal, and they are prevailing over millions of other Americans who do not. If there is a legislative link, it is in the national anti-abortion groups, like Susan B. Anthony List or National Right to Life, who offer model legislation and research for lawmakers and activists. Firms like the Alliance Defending Freedom or Americans United for Life offer legal counsel as the laws take shape. But raw cultural momentum has taken over and shows no signs of slowing. “The advice of lawyers is of less concern than it ever has been in the pro-life movement right now,” Mr. Lee said. “They don’t care. Social movements sometimes take on a life of their own.” That is what happened in Alabama, which on Wednesday passed the nation’s most restrictive measure, effectively banning abortion unless a woman’s health is at “serious” risk. The president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition, Eric Johnston, who calls himself an abortion purist, felt the slew of anti-abortion legislation that has been approved by other states in recent months did not go far enough. [Alabama passed one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws. Here’s what happens next.] This included even the so-called fetal heartbeat bills, which outlaw abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when an ultrasound may be able to detect the pulsing of what will become the fetus’s heart. Even in cases of rape and incest the fetus must always be the primary concern, he said, but not if the mother’s life is in danger. Last summer, as the Senate prepared to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Mr. Johnston, 72, saw an opportunity. After years of pushing various abortion restrictions, he began to write a bill for his most restrictive one yet. His language became central to the final law. The Supreme Court may decide not to take any abortion cases. But Mr. Johnston and other activists channeling the movement’s energy say this is the closest they have ever come to a perfect shot. “All the stars were lining up,” he said. “I thought, This may be the best time to do it.” Activists in Utah say that strategy never would have worked in their state, even though they applaud Alabama’s boldness. Mary Taylor, who leads ProLife Utah, said she felt “envious” watching other states pass anti-abortion bills. The Utah Legislature is a bit more cautious, she said, and so her coalition decided to push the 18-week ban instead of others that would go into effect around six weeks. Still, the surge of proposals across the country have helped her brainstorm more of her own for the next legislative session. Sometimes she talks with friends she has met over the years, like Ms. Liebel. But a simple newspaper article about another state’s strategy is often enough to generate a new idea, and a phone call to a new ally about how to proceed. “I’ll reach out and ask, ‘What were your strong points, what were the pitfalls?’ Things like that,” she said. “I’ve got one in the works right now.” The success of the anti-abortion movement is far from sudden. In Ohio, Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, said legislative successes in his state have come about through years of slow, careful and sometimes tedious work. Because Ohio was the first state to try, in 2011, to pass a ban on abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, Mr. Gonidakis said he had received calls from “state senators in almost every Midwestern state” asking about strategy. He also talked on the phone with policy staff for the State Senate in Kentucky, which later passed its own heartbeat bill. [What are “heartbeat” laws, and what do they mean for women?] Activists have been buttressed by many of the nation’s conservative churches, which have increased their emphasis on abortion policy in recent years. A few decades ago, many Southern Baptist churches would preach far more frequently against divorce, fornication and premarital sex, said Wayne Flynt, one of Alabama’s most influential historians and an ordained Baptist minister. “There has been a huge shift,” he said, “and a narrowing of focus to abortion and same-sex marriage.” This cultural movement is finding wins beyond the outright abortion bans. In Arkansas, where lawmakers recently banned most abortions after 18 weeks, Rose Mimms, who has led Arkansas Right to Life for 26 years, worked to pass additional priorities of the movement that have gotten much less public attention. While fellow activists pushed through things like the ban and a trigger law to outlaw most abortions if Roe is overturned, Ms. Mimms, 64, focused on under-the-radar bills, like one to amend the state’s safe haven law. A couple of years ago, she heard an activist speak about a “Safe Haven Baby Boxes” project, to install and promote secure boxes at hospitals and fire stations for women to surrender their infants without the threat of criminal prosecution. The interaction prompted her to push for a new law, passed this February, to add fire stations as a drop-off location. Republican control over state legislatures, built since the Tea Party wave in 2010, has made much of the anti-abortion movement’s success possible. A vision for the Missouri bill started to emerge when its Republican freshman legislators took a bus trip across the state in 2018. Ms. Coleman, 37, a newly elected state representative and longtime anti-abortion activist, struck up conversation with two other colleagues about how to build a new legislative strategy. Later, they combined forces with others and the legislation grew into what they called a “pro-life omnibus.” It included bans on abortions based on race, sex and Down syndrome diagnosis. It also included a tax credit for donations to pregnancy centers run by abortion opponents and a requirement that both parents be notified when a minor seeks an abortion. Currently, consent is required only from one. One of the legislators’ goals was to try new legal arguments in the state, and to review circuit court opinions on past laws to anticipate future roadblocks, Ms. Coleman said between votes on Thursday. Counterpunches from Democrats in blue states only cemented the movement’s resolve. Outrage among activists grew after New York passed a law protecting abortion in later stages of pregnancy, and Virginia’s governor used language that many Republicans saw as an endorsement of infanticide. Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor, described a situation in which an infant would be delivered with severe deformities, and then a “discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” In Mississippi, anger over the remarks in Virginia led to a meeting between two of the state’s most powerful men, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Senator Joey Fillingane, a leading critic of abortion in the Legislature. That impromptu conversation revived a bill, now signed into law, that would effectively ban abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy. Abortion rights groups are planning to fight many of these laws in court. On Tuesday, at statehouses and courthouses nationwide, groups like Naral and Planned Parenthood are planning to protest the slew of new abortion bans. “We must unite against this unprecedented attack on our fundamental rights and freedoms,” Dr. Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. “We are in the fight of our lives.” Opponents, for their part, feel the same about their fight. “It doesn’t take any coordination,” said Mr. Reeves, who is running for governor of Mississippi. “Obviously, in anything in life, whether it’s a basketball game or my daughter’s 14-and-under travel softball team this weekend, momentum matters. As momentum grows, it gives others the ability and confidence that they can get this done.” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Mary Elizabeth Coleman of Missouri.

2019,‘This One Hurts’: Rockets Despair After Warriors Eliminate Them From Playoffs,"On Pro Basketball HOUSTON — A standing ovation from their teammates greeted Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors when they finally made it back to the visitors’ locker room late Friday night after the last of their on-court obligations. That was several minutes after Bob Myers, Golden State’s president of basketball operations, fielded a congratulatory FaceTime call from his injured but giddy superstar Kevin Durant as the game wound down. Forced to watch on television back in the Bay Area, Durant didn’t even want to wait until the final buzzer to join the revelry. [Read what John Branch writes will be lost, and gained, when the Warriors leave Oakland for San Francisco.] The Warriors’ postgame merriment at Toyota Center was so spirited and unscripted, awash with clingy hugs and expletive-filled shouts of joy, that it would have been easy for an outsider to surmise that they had just won a championship with this 118-113 triumph over the Houston Rockets in Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals. They still need eight more victories to clinch a fourth title in five seasons, but second-round success has clearly never meant more to them. “It was about as fun as our first championship,” said Shaun Livingston, one of six holdovers from the Warriors’ first Curry-led title team in 2015. “This night had those kind of vibes.” Said Draymond Green: “I’m not going to sit here and sugarcoat it — like yeah, we’re used to winning, but this one felt amazing.” Curry rebounded from the first scoreless opening half of his playoff career to register a redemptive 33 points after intermission. Thompson scored 21 of his 27 points in the first half while Curry looked utterly lost, and drained the dagger 3-pointer from the left wing with 36.1 seconds to go that kick-started the Golden State festivities. Warriors Coach Steve Kerr used nine other players to compensate for Durant’s absence and started the veteran center Andrew Bogut in Durant’s place. After taking it all in, Bogut echoed Livingston and declared it “the best victory I’ve been a part of as a Golden State Warrior.” The sentiments were easy to understand on both sides after Golden State, by closing out its biggest rivals without Durant, plunged James Harden, Chris Paul and the rest of the Rockets into newfound depths of despair. You thought it was bad when Houston missed 27 consecutive 3-pointers at home in Game 7 of last season’s epic Western Conference finals? The Rockets didn’t even try to deny that falling short of Game 7 this time — with visiting Golden State missing both Durant and DeMarcus Cousins from its starting lineup — landed worse. “Well, this one’s going to leave a mark,” Houston Coach Mike D’Antoni said. “This is not just something you get over with. I’m definitely not going to get over it in this press conference, or tomorrow, or the next night. This one hurts.” The Rockets, remember, had spent much of the past year insisting to anyone who would listen that they were only a “hamstring away” — to use Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey’s shorthand for Paul’s pulled hamstring — from ousting the Warriors and going on to win the 2018 championship. The sudden manner in which Golden State lost Durant to a strained right calf Wednesday night in Game 5, at the same stage Paul was felled, seemed to set Houston up so perfectly for vengeance. At worst, Houston was an overwhelming favorite to win this Game 6 and drag Golden State into a Durant-less Game 7 at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif., on Sunday afternoon. But the stubborn Curry, Thompson, Green (8 points, 10 rebounds and 7 assists) and Andre Iguodala (with five 3-pointers in a playoff game for the first time since 2013) simply would not let it happen. You can see why Golden State has a ridiculous record of 30-4 over the past three seasons, including the playoffs, when Durant is out but Curry is still in uniform. With the game tied at 97, Curry scored 16 points in the final four minutes to Houston’s 16 as a team in the same span. The Warriors’ old reliables, helped along by Kevon Looney’s 14 points and a bonus 11 from Livingston, hauled the visitors to a win that inspired no less an N.B.A. luminary than LeBron James to tweet the following in admiration: “NEVER underestimate the heart of a Champion!!!!” Cue more heartache for the Rockets. James was quoting an old Houston line made famous in basketball lore by Coach Rudy Tomjanovich after his 1994-95 Rockets overcame being a lowly No. 6 seed to win a second straight championship. That was also the era when Houstonians began referring to their town as Clutch City, but those days have never seemed more distant after the Rockets botched their best chance yet to exorcise their Golden State demons. Harden overcame an uncharacteristic five missed free throws to finish with 35 points, while Paul delivered his best game of the series with 27 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists. And none of that will spare the Rockets’ star duo and D’Antoni another long and uncomfortable wait to try again to hush their louder-than-ever skeptics. “They’re a great team,” Harden said. “We’re not losing to some scrubs. We’ve got to find a way to keep getting better, keep growing and keep putting ourselves in position to keep playing them.” Easily forgotten, especially amid the waves of criticism that the Rockets will face now, is that Houston’s hunger to challenge the Warriors is unmatched around the league. Since December 2017, Morey has spoken openly about how the Rockets are “basically obsessed” with trying to dethrone them, as opposed to waiting out the Warriors’ dynasty like so many other teams. That spirit should probably grant them a measure of pause before Harden and Co. are blasted for the opportunities they just squandered — even though it won’t. Houston’s bigger problem, of course, is that it already has $115 million invested in five players for next season: Harden, an aging Paul, Eric Gordon, P. J. Tucker and the disappointing big man Clint Capela. The flexibility to make the sort of moves the Houston owner Tilman Fertitta vowed to make in defeat — “I can promise you we’re going to win some championships with James Harden,” Fertitta said — just isn’t there. The Rockets’ best hope may rest with a potential Durant defection in free agency, but the Warriors, frankly, looked as united as ever as they made their way to an overnight flight home to await Tuesday’s Game 1 of the conference finals against the winner of the other semifinal series between the Denver Nuggets and the Portland Trail Blazers. Their Game 7 is Sunday afternoon. Although there are bound to be questions about how much freshness the Warriors have left after what they expended to see off Houston, be advised that team officials are optimistic about Durant returning to the lineup at some point in the next round. I’m told that Cousins, furthermore, is also firmly on track to return to active duty during the conference finals from his recent torn quadriceps muscle. Not that you should expect anyone still alive in these playoffs to be openly pining for a shot at Golden State as Houston was. The championship response from the Warriors in the wake of Durant’s scary calf injury has undoubtedly restored some of their old fear factor. “You have to give them credit,” Gordon said. “They just know who they are.”",The New York Times
2019,Inside the Network of Anti-Abortion Activists Winning Across the U.S.,"State after state is passing sweeping abortion restrictions this year, from Alabama’s near total abortion ban, to Ohio’s ban after a fetal heartbeat is detected, to Utah’s ban after a pregnancy reaches 18 weeks. Already, eight states have passed laws that could challenge federal protections for abortion, with more on the way, prompting jubilation on the right and fear on the left. The laws may appear to present a united front and a coordinated political campaign. Instead they reflect a sustained effort by a network of disparate activists, each with their own strategy honed over decades of work. “It’s not like there’s some master planner out there saying, ‘This state should do this and this state should do that,’” said Samuel Lee, a longtime lobbyist for anti-abortion legislation in Missouri. “But there are some creative people out there in different states trying different things.” The anti-abortion movement, built over nearly five decades, is closer than it has ever been to its long-held dream of dismantling Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Empowered by a president who pushes their priorities, by a Supreme Court now seemingly tipped in their favor and by sheer determination, anti-abortion activists and lawmakers across the country have pushed dozens of bills into law in the past few months. The most aggressive of the anti-abortion laws that have been passed have not taken effect and are expected to face challenges in court — which in some cases was an aim of the anti-abortion activists to begin with. Perhaps more than any coordinated strategy, activists across the country are tapping into the same energy and feeding on one another’s momentum. “This is a wave that is rolling across our country in the pro-life states,” said Sue Swayze Liebel, who runs the National Pro-Life Women’s Caucus for Susan B. Anthony List. “Everybody just put the pedal down, let’s all go, everybody rushing to the finish line.” [How banning abortion in the early weeks of pregnancy became mainstream.] Ms. Liebel spent the most momentous week in years for the anti-abortion movement on the road. She started with activists in Texas, to drum up support for a bill that would ban abortion on the basis of race, sex or disability. By Wednesday, she was at the Missouri Statehouse to champion a bill that would ban abortions after the eighth week of pregnancy. By the end of the week, she was cheering friends like State Representative Mary Elizabeth Coleman of Missouri, an architect of the bill, as it passed the Legislature. The movement’s grass-roots networks can be hard to define. Activists are more likely to coordinate through their Catholic and evangelical churches than on mass political listservs or email chains. In some states the local Right to Life chapter may be the strongest activist hub. In others, it might be the Concerned Women for America chapter, or the regional Family Policy Council group. The activists do not often agree on whether their priority should be to pass a six-week ban or a 20-week one. But together, their efforts have magnified the voices of millions of Americans who want abortion to be illegal, and they are prevailing over millions of other Americans who do not. If there is a legislative link, it is in the national anti-abortion groups, like Susan B. Anthony List or National Right to Life, who offer model legislation and research for lawmakers and activists. Firms like the Alliance Defending Freedom or Americans United for Life offer legal counsel as the laws take shape. But raw cultural momentum has taken over and shows no signs of slowing. “The advice of lawyers is of less concern than it ever has been in the pro-life movement right now,” Mr. Lee said. “They don’t care. Social movements sometimes take on a life of their own.” That is what happened in Alabama, which on Wednesday passed the nation’s most restrictive measure, effectively banning abortion unless a woman’s health is at “serious” risk. The president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition, Eric Johnston, who calls himself an abortion purist, felt the slew of anti-abortion legislation that has been approved by other states in recent months did not go far enough. [Alabama passed one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws.

2019,‘Threatening the Future’: The High Stakes of Deepening School Segregation,"[For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] The 65th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education is on Friday, but fights over school segregation, rather than decreasing, are becoming more common. Cities like New York and San Francisco are debating how to assign students to schools in ways that foster classroom diversity, and school secession movements — in which parents seek to form their own, majority-white districts — are accelerating. A new report from U.C.L.A. and Penn State outlines the changes in school segregation since the landmark Supreme Court ruling named after Oliver Brown, a black father who sued to enroll his daughter, Linda, in an all-white elementary school blocks from their home in Topeka, Kan. The court’s unanimous 1954 ruling declared separate educational facilities “inherently unequal.” But the case is one of several major civil rights rulings, alongside those on voting rights and housing discrimination, that have been substantially weakened by more recent decisions. Today, the decreasing white share of the public school population across the country may lead some to believe that schools are becoming more integrated. But the reverse is true, according to the report. The percentage of intensely segregated schools, defined as those where less than 10 percent of the student body is white, tripled between 1988 and 2016, from 6 to 18 percent. In “a heightened period of racial conflict in our public life,” the report warns, deepening school segregation by race and class “are very high stakes trends threatening the future.” White students now account for less than half of the nation’s public school students, and Latinos are the most deeply segregated racial group in schools, according to the researchers. While segregation was once most severe in the former states of the Confederacy, in 2016 it was in four liberal states — New York, California, Maryland and Illinois — that black children were most likely to attend intensely segregated schools. Latinos were most likely to attend intensely segregated schools in California, New York, Texas and New Jersey. Nationwide, 42 percent of Latino students and 40 percent of black students attended schools where less than 10 percent of their peers were white in 2016. Those numbers have been rising since 1988. Statistics like these are no surprise after decades of court rulings that released school districts from desegregation orders, and there is no consensus among education advocates about how to respond. Some are urging broad new public policy efforts to integrate schools, while others call that goal unrealistic and even a distraction from improving the schools that currently enroll large numbers of nonwhite and low-income children. There were some bright spots, the researchers noted. In the Midwest, the share of black children attending intensely segregated schools has steadily decreased since 2001. With a growing population of Latino and Asian schoolchildren, segregation looks a lot different today than it did in the 1950s. Some superintendents and policymakers may believe, “We’re not a black and white district anymore, so we need to move beyond desegregation,” said Erica Frankenberg, a professor of education at Penn State and an author of the report. Instead, she added, they should ask, “What does it mean to desegregate when we have four racial groups, and some of these racial groups also have tremendous variety within them? What does that look like?” High-poverty, racially segregated schools typically have fewer experienced teachers, advanced courses and extracurricular opportunities. A large body of research shows that nonwhite and low-income students who attend integrated schools perform better academically, and also see long-term benefits such as higher incomes and lower rates of incarceration. White students who attend more integrated schools are not hurt academically, and may benefit from exposure to classmates who better represent the nation’s diversity. In 2016, 48 percent of public school students were white, 26 percent were Latino, 15 percent were black and 6 percent were Asian. According to the new report, the average white student in 2016 attended a school that was 69 percent white; the average Latino student attended a school that was 55 percent Latino; the average black student attended a school that was 47 percent black; and the average Asian student attended a school that was 24 percent Asian. Of particular concern to the researchers were the suburbs of large cities, because demographic change there has been so rapid. Between 2006 and 2016, the proportion of white public school enrollment in those suburbs fell by 10 percentage points, to 47 percent. That diversity was not reflected in schools. The typical suburban black or Latino child attended a school in 2016 that was three-quarters nonwhite, while the typical suburban white child attended a school that was two-thirds white. Because so few suburbs, especially outside the South, have a history of purposeful policymaking around school integration, “Doing nothing means accepting resegregation,” the report notes. White children who lived in large cities experienced more diversity, attending schools that were, on average, 55 percent nonwhite. But even there, white parents were clustering their children in a subset of schools; over all, white students made up only 20 percent of the students in those districts. The authors of the report, Professor Frankenberg, Jongyeon Ee, Jennifer Ayscue and Gary Orfield, suggest several policy remedies, such as using magnet programs and busing to draw students voluntarily to schools outside their neighborhoods and districts. They urge more federal and philanthropic investment in local experiments to increase integration, and they ask schools, particularly those in formerly white-majority suburbs, to diversify their staffs and add programming meant to serve students of color. Still, given the long history of white resistance to desegregation efforts, and the sense of exclusion some students of color feel in majority-white schools, some education advocates remain skeptical of relying too heavily on integration as a strategy for improving educational outcomes. “There are two ways to experience school integration policy in America: On paper and in real life,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of 50CAN, an organization that supports charter schools and school choice. The goal, he said, should be to “build schools that people are attracted to, regardless of who goes to them.” He continued, “I think schools are an important place to bring us together. But they are not the only place where the work of integrating society must happen, and in many respects, schools are not equipped to deal with the history of this nation which has separated us in the first place.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Time Is Up’: Pakistan’s Army Targets Protest Movement, Stifling Dissent","ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan’s powerful military has seemed unstoppable recently in getting what it wants: its favored candidate as prime minister, a victory of sorts in a dogfight with the Indian military, and its media critics hounded into silence or compliance. Now, the Pakistani Army has turned its sights on ending one of the last unbending sources of dissent to its power, an ethnic Pashtun rights protest movement known as P.T.M. that has called the Pakistani security forces to account for extrajudicial killings and other injustices. Trying to stop a rights demonstration in the troubled region of Waziristan on Sunday, the security forces killed at least eight people, according to members of the movement who described the dead as unarmed and peaceful protesters. The army also took into custody Ali Wazir, one of the movement’s leaders and a member of the country’s Parliament. After months of threatening and arresting leading P.T.M. figures, the army has made clear that it will no longer tolerate the group. A military spokesman said that its members attacked and wounded security forces before any shooting started — though the army has shown no evidence to counter witness accounts and videos largely pointing to the contrary. The military also accuses the protest movement of being a proxy for enemies in India and Afghanistan. For its part, the P.T.M. leadership has insisted since the attack that their members who were fired upon were unarmed and that the movement would not back down. Protests broke out Monday all around Pakistan’s Pashtun-heavy northwestern frontier. “This terrorism? Behind it is the uniform,” protesters shouted in Wana, Waziristan, referring to the country’s military. “This thuggery? Behind it is the uniform.” The Pakistani state has long had a troubled relationship with its Pashtun population, the second largest ethnic group in the country. Many Pashtun leaders disagreed with the formation of Pakistan when the country split from India in 1947. More recently, the Pakistani Army has often treated Pashtuns with suspicion because the Taliban militancy against the state has been predominantly Pashtun — though locals in Pashtun areas say that their area was until recently governed by draconian, colonial-era laws, and that they feel trampled both by the militants and the Pakistani military. When the P.T.M. started last year, its leaders were blunt about the prospect of being jailed or killed even as they clung to nonviolent protest. “We’re dying anyway,” was a common explanation of their resolve. Now, the military seems set to make that prediction true, setting up a conflict that some observers are already comparing, if prematurely, to when Pakistan’s oppressed Bengali population broke away to form Bangladesh in 1971. Last month, the military’s main spokesperson made it clear that the P.T.M. would no longer be tolerated, and that their next big move could be their last. The warning came at a time when Pakistan’s military was particularly confident, having recently shot down an Indian warplane and captured its pilot. “Their time is up,” Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the spokesman, said of the P.T.M. at a news conference. Details of Sunday’s clash are not clear. Eyewitnesses said a convoy of P.T.M. supporters, including two of its leaders who are members of Parliament, were on their way to a sit-in of tribal elders in Datta Khel in North Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan. The situation in the area has been tense. Earlier this month, Pakistani forces came under fire and lost one soldier. No group claimed the attack, but in retaliation, the military raided villages and rounded up people. The villagers protested the heavy-handed response. When the convoy was trying to cross a checkpoint to reach the sit-in, security forces blocked their path. On the other side of the checkpoint, eyewitnesses said dozens of people from the sit-in arrived to receive the P.T.M. members. “It was clearly a charged situation, but it is not clear what triggered the military personnel to start firing,” said Hamid Ullah, a local resident who witnessed the incident. Videos from the scene before and after the firing did not show any armed men among the protesters. One video shows the convoy had crossed the checkpoint, and Ali Wazir, one of the lawmakers, was being received with a garland of flowers by protesters when shooting erupted and the crowd around him dispersed. Mohsin Dawar, a leader of the P.T.M. and the second member of Parliament accompanying the convoy, rejected the military’s claim that P.T.M. supporters had fired at soldiers at the checkpoint. Mr. Dawar said all the supporters with him were unarmed. He urged an independent investigation. “P.T.M. is ready to present itself in any commission,” Mr. Dawar said. “Killing unarmed and entirely peaceful protesters in broad daylight cannot be justified under any Pakistani and international law.” After arresting his fellow member of Parliament, Mr. Dawar said the military was searching for him as well. He spoke via satellite phone from an undisclosed location. “North Waziristan has become a black hole since the incident,” he said. “Curfew has been imposed. Phones are not working. Roads are closed. The entire district has become a jail.” Manzoor Pashteen, the top leader of the P.T.M., said on Twitter that the group will continue its nonviolent constitutional struggle. “Those who attack, do they come with garlands of flowers around their necks?” he said, sharing videos showing unarmed protesters. “Which one of these regular folks and the people’s representatives are carrying weapons?” The trigger for the movement’s start last February was the killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, an aspiring model from South Waziristan with a large social media following who was shot dead by the police. Its growth has been rapid, and its often emotional rallies — with elderly mothers carrying pictures of children who are missing and allegedly disappeared by Pakistani forces — have drawn thousands of people. The Pakistani military has resorted to wide-ranging restrictions and harassment of the movement, and a media ban of their rallies and activities seems to be in place. As the P.T.M. increased pressure, Pakistan’s military has accommodated some of its demands, such as reducing the number of checkpoints in North and South Waziristan, easing aggressive searches, relaxing the curfew, starting demining programs and offering answers to some of the families searching for missing people. Current and former security officials said P.T.M. had proved difficult to control, largely because it has stuck to nonviolence and kept their demands within constitutional bounds. In this, they were different from Balochi separatists, who formed an armed insurgency, against whom Pakistan’s military could more easily justify the use of force. Despite publicly branding the P.T.M. a tool of foreign intelligence, in private Pakistani military officials seem divided about how much the movement owed to instigators from abroad and how much came from “emotional youth protesting for genuine grievances,” one senior retired official said. Pakistan’s human rights commission and international rights bodies have expressed alarm over the use of military force and have demanded investigations. What happens to the P.T.M. will be an indication of whether Pakistan will regain some of its lost space for dissent, or fall further into military control. Omar Waraich, the deputy director for South Asia at Amnesty International, said Pakistan’s human rights situation has sunk to its lowest since the 1980s rule of the military dictator Gen. Zia ul-Haq. “What was once space for a vibrant civil society and a lively if raucous media has progressively shrunk to the point of suffocation,” Mr. Waraich said. “P.T.M. has been the boldest attempt yet to hold the state accountable for human rights violations, especially against Pashtuns. The crackdown is the latest demonstration by the state, and particularly the military, that it will not tolerate dissent.” OpinionManzoor Ahmad Pashteen",The New York Times
2019,‘Tolkien’ Review: A Fellowship That Rings Obvious,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Tolkien” opens in the trenches of the Somme during World War I. The young J.R.R. Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult), a second lieutenant delirious with fever and exhaustion, rushes through bloody, muddy, fetid pathways desperately looking for a friend. Over the tops of the trenches he sees fire that looks like dragon’s breath; eventually he will see, yes, a dragon. Following Tolkien on what seems a fool’s errand is a boyish, worried, unfailingly loyal adjutant named, you guessed it, Sam. The biopic flashes back to Tolkien’s school days; the younger incarnation of the writer, played by Harry Gilby, is placed in foster care after the death of his lively, storytelling mother, and into a prestigious boy’s academy. After some skirmishes with the headmaster’s son, Tolkien eventually makes friends with the young man and his other mates, and they semiformally form a, you guessed it, fellowship. Directed by Dome Karukoski from a script by David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford, this picture about the pre-fame days of the author of “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” teems with many on-the-nose moments. And it does so while hewing so strongly to the Distinguished British Biopic ethos (including the “England: Land of Magnificent Sunsets” trope) that it teeters on the edge of genuine obnoxiousness. Surprisingly, the emphatic score by the customarily more nuanced Thomas Newman is one of the prime offenders. Nevertheless, “Tolkien” manages several scenes of credible emotional delicacy. And it doesn’t shy away from the conspicuously literary, treating the writer’s explorations of Wagner (sparked by his love interest and future wife Edith, played by Lily Collins) and passion for philology (sparked by chats with the intimidating professor Joseph Wright, played by Derek Jacobi) with a commendable amount of detail.

2019,"‘Too Late to Die Young’ Review: Big Changes, Quietly Observed","Dominga Sotomayor’s new film is set among artists vacationing in Chile in 1990. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Too Late to Die Young,” Dominga Sotomayor’s haunting third feature, could be classified as a summer vacation coming-of-age story. Since it takes place in Chile, summer coincides with New Year’s Eve, when the movie’s big, climactic party takes place. The setting is highly specific. The year drawing to a close is 1990, when the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet came to an end. Though nobody on screen talks about politics, the sense of exhaustion and tentative optimism that hovers over their actions might have something to do with the state of their country. Or maybe not. Sotomayor approaches her characters and their problems with subtlety and tact, and is more interested in reading their glances and gestures than in putting words in their mouths. In any case, her attention is focused on the daily routines at a makeshift vacation colony in the foothills of the Andes, where a group of artistically inclined adults and their children and pets have come to escape the stresses of city life. The younger children ride bikes, splash around in the swimming hole and nap in the sun. Their teenage siblings smoke, strum guitars and flirt. The grown-ups gossip, cook, drink wine and discuss work that needs to be done. There are intimations of trouble: a break-in at one of the cabins; disputes over water; concerns about fire and relations with the locals; marital tensions. But most of what happens has a ritualistic feel, and the still, dusty air wraps the story in nostalgia. A romantic triangle takes shape involving Sofia (Demian Hernández), who is 16. Lucas (Antar Machado), who is her age, is clearly in love with her, but she’s more interested in Ignacio (Matías Oviedo), an older guy with a motorbike. Sofia’s parents are separated, and she is impatient for adulthood. When her father tells her to put out a cigarette, she says: “I’m a smoker. End of discussion.” A younger girl, Clara (Magdalena Tótoro), searches for a lost dog, whose disappearance is both a plot device and something of a metaphor. The families are set in their ways, but at the same time relations among them seem fragile and fungible. Their world looks stable and also as if it might collapse at any moment. “Too Late to Die Young” is above all an achievement in mood and implication. Sotomayor has a way of structuring scenes and composing images that makes everything perfectly clear but not obvious. Motives and actions are mysterious and relationships are ambiguous not because she wants to mystify anyone or anything, but because she’s a realist. By the end of the film, you know its world intimately, without necessarily understanding it any better than the people you’ve been observing. Too Late to Die Young Not rated. In Spanish, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes.

2019,‘Trial by Fire’ Review: A Strong Case Against the Death Penalty,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Like the 1995 picture “Dead Man Walking,” “Trial by Fire” was created by filmmakers who believe that capital punishment is barbaric both as policy and in practice. This fact-based film takes the argument a step further in its details: While “Walking” was about a confessed killer who sought spiritual redemption, “Trial by Fire” details the state killing of a man many believe to have been innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. The man was Cameron Todd Willingham, who was found guilty of killing his three daughters by arson in 1991. Some time before his execution in 2004, various authorities were presented with evidence that the fire had not been set by Willingham and that his protests of innocence were sincere. Directed by Edward Zwick (“Glory,” “The Last Samurai,” and more recently, “Jack Reacher: Never Go Back”) from a script by Geoffrey Fletcher (“Precious”), the movie is based on a New Yorker article by David Grann. The story as told by Grann is detailed and linear, in a prose style both spare and refined. The dramatization hems and haws, incorporating flashbacks, fantasy sequences and other features intended to add intrigue to the narrative and depth to the characterizations. They wind up feeling like window-dressing, though. Expertly acted throughout — Jack O’Connell does his level best to make Willingham more than the standard-issue Hollywood Complex Roughneck, while Laura Dern, as a prison pen pal who becomes a defense ally, is a reliably elevating presence — the movie’s raw facts are sufficient to rouse viewer indignation. But the material arguably calls for a more proactively provocative approach. Where are old-school cinematic firebrands like Sam Fuller or Phil Karlson when you need them?

2019,‘Trust in Cyril Ramaphosa’? South Africa Election Tests A.N.C. Leader’s Strength,"JOHANNESBURG — Millions of South Africans cast ballots on Wednesday, voting for the first time since President Cyril Ramaphosa assumed power early last year with promises to renew both his corruption-ridden party and the beleaguered nation. A quarter-century after the end of apartheid captured imaginations worldwide, Mr. Ramaphosa and his party, the African National Congress, faced an electorate increasingly disillusioned with the state of South Africa’s democracy. The vote is partly a referendum on Mr. Ramaphosa, whose personal popularity has consistently polled higher than his party’s. Many of the A.N.C.’s traditional supporters approve of him, polls show. But they question whether he can outflank powerful party rivals and root out the endemic corruption that has come to define the A.N.C., Nelson Mandela’s once celebrated liberation movement. “I got trust in Cyril Ramaphosa — he’s done a lot already against corruption,” Reckson Chauke, a 57-year-old steelworker, said after he voted for the A.N.C. in Alexandra, a black township in Johannesburg. About 50 miles to the south in Sharpeville, the site of a 1960 massacre that was a turning point in the fight against apartheid, Johanna Sothoane, 72, said she had cast a ballot against the A.N.C. for the first time since she began voting in 1994. “People are getting tired of the A.N.C. The corruption which is there, I don’t know. It’s terrible,” Ms. Sothoane said as she left the polling station. “Ramaphosa? He didn’t convince me.” She would not say which party she had supported. [Look back on a quarter-century of transformation in South Africa after the end of apartheid.] Mr. Ramaphosa made the battle against corruption a pillar of his campaign. At his party’s last rally before Election Day, he addressed widespread criticism that no party official has been held accountable for corruption since he forced Jacob Zuma, his scandal-tainted predecessor, out of office more than a year ago. “We are going to fight against corruption despite stern opposition from those who benefited,” Mr. Ramaphosa said in an unmistakable reference to members of his party. But even the last days of the campaign offered constant, and sometimes unusual, reminders of the challenges he faces. A top A.N.C. leader accused the government of spying on him. And a long-running government inquiry on public corruption turned to the issue of rampant looting of the state-owned transport company. [Read more on corruption scandals in South Africa under the African National Congress.] Nationally, the party, which has governed continuously since 1994, is all but certain to win enough votes to ensure that Mr. Ramaphosa secures the five-year presidential term. Election officials said they hoped to announce final tallies on Saturday, though the results are expected to be evident by Friday. But the outcome of two other issues — the A.N.C.’s margin of victory and its hold on the provinces, especially the nation’s richest, Gauteng — could have far-reaching repercussions. In the last general election, in 2014, the A.N.C. won 62 percent of the vote nationwide. It also won all nine provinces, except the Western Cape, the nation’s second-richest, which for the past decade has been in the hands of the Democratic Alliance, the main opposition. A significant win nationwide could hand Mr. Ramaphosa a popular mandate in his anti-corruption drive. But a dip below the symbolically important threshold of 60 percent — which the A.N.C. has never dropped beneath — could embolden his rivals within his party, many of whom have close ties to Mr. Zuma. The results in Gauteng — home to Johannesburg and Pretoria, the commercial and political capitals — could speed up the realignment of the nation’s politics. Polls show that the province is a key battleground in the election, with the A.N.C. at risk of being forced into a coalition. To try to keep the province, the A.N.C. fought hard in townships like Alexandra, where Mr. Ramaphosa campaigned personally. Though it has been a party stronghold, many township residents were looking to alternatives. “The A.N.C. has always been in charge in Gauteng, but what have they accomplished?” said Bonang Kgwadi, 18, who was voting with her sister, Emily, 21. Both first-time voters, they said they supported the Democratic Alliance because they had been impressed by its stewardship over the Western Cape. Support for the party has been falling in Gauteng in the past five years, especially among black middle-class voters angered by corruption. In local elections in 2016, many turned against the party, which ended up losing both Johannesburg and Pretoria. The cities are now led by fragile coalitions between the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters, a splinter group led by former A.N.C. leaders. Mr. Ramaphosa — an A.N.C. veteran who made a fortune in business before returning to politics in 2012 — campaigned hard to win back alienated black professionals in the cities. He is particularly popular among these voters as well as white South Africans. But politicians and voters on the left, especially the young, say that Mr. Ramaphosa is a symptom of a larger problem: a small, A.N.C.-connected black elite that has grown rich while the vast majority of black voters remain impoverished in an economy still largely controlled by white South Africans. Across the nation, the A.N.C.’s strongest support lies in poor rural and urban communities where many residents remain dependent on the party for jobs, business, housing and other benefits. Mr. Zuma and his allies appealed to them, promising a “radical economic transformation.” In Orange Farm, a rural area south of Johannesburg, Loraine Menoe, 51, said she had voted for the A.N.C. just as she has in every election since 1994. The party, she said, had brought tangible change to the lives of people like her: public housing, electricity, schools for all black children and monthly cash grants. She said her family received about $200 a month and had gotten government housing two months ago. “I waited 20 years, but at last I got it,” said Ms. Menoe, who is unemployed. “Even God says that everyone must wait for his turn.” Though a moderate, Mr. Ramaphosa has been forced to adopt some of his rivals’ positions, including a potentially explosive one that would allow the expropriation of land for black South Africans without compensation for the current owners. That issue has been championed most aggressively by the Economic Freedom Fighters, whose leaders, usually clad in red overalls, have tapped a growing frustration among poor and young voters. Polling data show that support for the party, which was founded in 2013, is expected to climb in this vote. In Alexandra, Thembi Tshabalala, 54, said she was voting for the Economic Freedom Fighters. “I’ve always voted for the A.N.C., but I’m still unemployed and I’m still living in a shack,” Ms. Tshabalala said, adding that she shared her home with a brother and two grandchildren. “When it rains, it gets wet inside.” Mr. Ramaphosa, who served as Mr. Zuma’s deputy for nearly four years, narrowly became the A.N.C. leader in a party vote in December 2017. Two months later, he forced Mr. Zuma to step down as the country’s president, about a year before the end of his term. The excitement over Mr. Ramaphosa’s presidency — called “Ramaphoria” — fizzled out in the following months. Little came of his promise to jump-start the economy as South African businesses and foreign investors took a wait-and-see attitude. Mr. Ramaphosa moved quickly to gain control over state enterprises that had become a main source of graft during the Zuma years, and appointed respected individuals to the nation’s law-enforcement and tax agencies. But the slowness in introducing reforms became evident when trouble at Eskom, the state utility, led to the worst rolling blackouts in years. Mr. Ramaphosa has faced fierce resistance to cleaning up the A.N.C. Many senior party leaders — identified in a government inquiry into corruption as having been involved in illicit activities — remain in power at the highest levels of the party and government. The party’s own integrity commission recommended the removal of top figures from the A.N.C.’s list of candidates in the national vote. But party leaders decided to look into the matter only after the election. Ace Magashule, the party’s secretary general and the former leader of a province where corruption flourished under his watch, accused the government of tapping his phone. Mr. Ramaphosa dismissed the accusation.",The New York Times
2019,‘Tuca & Bertie’ Explores Dark Truths in the Kitchen,"critic’s notebook A loopy new animated series about two birds also provides sharp commentary on restaurant culture. Netflix’s new animated series “Tuca & Bertie” centers on the day-to-day adventures of two best friends who also happen to be birds, stumbling into their 30s together in Bird Town. The show is a raunchy, silly and often chaotic delight, propelled by charming, wacky animation. It’s also a sharp commentary on the #MeToo movement, especially as it has played out in professional kitchens across the country. More than a year has passed since Mario Batali stepped away from his restaurants following allegations of sexual misconduct, and only two months since his partnership with the Bastianich family of restaurateurs dissolved. Countless more stories of abusers in the food business have since come to light. But what, if anything, has changed? “Tuca & Bertie” pushes toward a messy answer, using the setting of a bakery where Bertie works not to teach an empowering lesson, or to offer a message of hope, but to point out the darker, complicated and more disappointing reality of the moment: So much remains unchanged. In the first episode, Bertie, a song thrush voiced by Ali Wong, and Tuca, a toucan voiced by Tiffany Haddish, chase a neighborhood bully to their local patisserie. There, they meet Pastry Pete, a chef who has won a Tasty Num-Num award for developing a fictional pastry that combines a cruller with a Bundt cake. He calls his creation the crunt. Pastry Pete and Bertie soon compete, baking croissants in an intense, sweaty montage. What seems like a harmless scene — a smug chef who underestimates Bertie’s skills as a baker — shapes the narrative arc of the show, which slowly illuminates the complexities of harassment in the kitchen and eventually looks back further to Bertie’s childhood trauma. It’s a ruthless combination of humor and devastating emotional nuance, and it guts. The best animated shows for adults have always used the surrealism of illustration to blow up some emotional truth. But their writers rooms have rarely been headed up by women. The creator of “Tuca & Bertie” is Lisa Hanawalt, the illustrator behind the series “BoJack Horseman.” “I chose cooking fairly early on in the process of developing her character,” Ms. Hanawalt said, referring to Bertie. “I wanted something that would be comparable to how I felt coming up in the comics world when I was a young cartoonist being mentored by older publishers and cartoonists.” The restaurant industry was an ideal setting, a space where the power dynamics can be particularly tyrannical and dysfunctional. Pastry Pete is well established and, as the inventor of the crunt, regarded as a kind of creative genius. That powerful reputation neatly covers up his abusive behavior. On the first day of her internship in his patisserie, before the anxious, hesitant Bertie has a chance to even say something about Pete’s invasion of her personal space, he invokes an enduring restaurant code: No matter what he says or what he asks of her, the only correct answer is “Yes, chef!” “When I was observing kitchens and kitchen culture, the ‘Yes, chef!’ thing really stood out to me,” Ms. Hanawalt said. “It seemed very ripe for the kind of storytelling I wanted to do.” (Ms. Hanawalt also noted that the character of Pastry Pete wasn’t based on a real chef.) When Pete puts his hands on Bertie’s head, forcing it toward the heat of a boiling pot of roux, he is testing his own powers over her. Adding to Bertie’s confusion is her initial crush on Pete, which manifests itself in sex dreams and heightened anxiety. Wanting to succeed at her dream job, and to please Pete, she channels all of this into the more rapid production of high-quality croissants and Danishes — into doing even better work. As a food conference approaches, Bertie prepares by mastering an impressive technique for the crünt, Pete’s newest invention: a hybrid croissant and Bundt cake. “Her Sailor Moon-esque dance of making it doesn’t really make sense, it’s pure fantasy,” Ms. Hanawalt said, “but I wanted something that displayed her virtuoso.” Despite her anxiety, Bertie nails the demonstration of the new pastry. But when she has to leave before the party that celebrates the end of the conference, Pete gets angry. “I can’t force you to make the right decision for your career,” he says menacingly. (Things aren’t much better at Bertie’s day job, at the magazine publisher Conde Nest, where a sexual harassment seminar involves a goose from human resources asking the entire conference room, “Who can tell me which parts of this doll it’s O.K. to whistle at?”) What helps Bertie finally recognize the problem at the patisserie is the appearance of another bird and aspiring baker — one who, when she is pushed toward the boiling pot, speaks up and walks out. “Some people can’t handle the rigors of this job,” Pete says, but Bertie isn’t falling for it this time. For such a weird, big-hearted, high-energy show, the realness of “Tuca & Bertie” can be acutely painful. Abusers don’t change. They often aren’t brought to justice. Pastry Pete doesn’t appear to learn anything at all or suffer for his actions, apart from getting pooped on by a giant bird. Flying overhead, Bertie cackles with Tuca, enjoying the deliciousness of the moment. Maybe that’s because she has to, knowing that the next day Pete will continue to sell his pastries, reputation and bank account intact, and this cartoon splat might be the only justice she ever sees.

2019,"‘UglyDolls’ Review: Stay Ugly, Friends","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Adults who regularly buy children’s gifts will recognize the denizens of the movie “UglyDolls,” the plush toys of the same name. Milder in design than old-school troll dolls, these figures have a message: Idiosyncrasies of appearance and personality are not “ugly,” but rather emblems of awesome individuality. The relentless positivity of this fable is put across with such bounce-house energy that children in the audience may be bludgeoned into submission instantly. (It made this adult’s teeth hurt.) Here, Moxy, the most cheerful doll in Uglyville, wakes each morning just knowing there’s a child for her in “the big world.” Moxy and some of her misfit pals set out to find said big world, only to be obstructed by the Institute of Perfection, a land of pretty dolls presided over by a pert-nosed, golden-haired paragon, creatively named Lou. He and some mean-girl dolls in his thrall will stop at nothing to thwart Moxy and her dream. These characters are voiced by some of the most prominent names in pop music: Kelly Clarkson, Janelle Monáe, Blake Shelton, Charli XCX, Pitbull and Nick Jonas, to name but a few. Comic talents such as Wanda Sykes and Gabriel Iglesias also feature. Yet every aspect of this computer-animated movie directed by Kelly Asbury seems equally overdetermined and tossed-off, as if it were a caffeinated weekend project for everyone involved. The neon colors bring to mind what a “Candy Crush” movie might look like, while the never-ending songs are cute, flavorless paeans to self-love. Individual scenes evoking “The Lego Movie” and “Toy Story 3” feel like lifts rather than homages, and are blatant to the extent that your older kids might even notice.

2019,‘Unlikely’ Hikers Hit the Trail,"trending Our public lands have a diversity problem. But grassroot initiatives and outdoor-gear companies hope to change that. Jenny BrusoCreditCreditPeter Hanson Jenny Bruso is a 37-year-old, plus-size, queer hiker living in Portland, Ore. She went on her first hike seven years ago after a person she was dating asked her to join. On the 5.8 mile loop trail she felt self-conscious, walking slowly and sweating because she wasn’t used to working out. “I really didn’t know what to do except walk,” she said. “But I felt something kind of unlock, this feeling of possibility like I was seeing nature for the first time.” Ms. Bruso became obsessed with hiking. But the more she hiked, the more she saw that the people on the trails did not resemble her. In 2016, she created an Instagram account, Unlikely Hikers, posting photographs of African-American, gay, transgender and disabled hikers. Within a year she had 8,000 followers and now she has more than 59,000. She also began to organize group hikes several times a month. Ms. Bruso is one of many hikers turning to social media to try to make the outdoors more welcoming and diverse. While Ms. Bruso targets all minorities, other hikers and outdoors groups try to inspire people from specific nationalities, identities or with physical challenges. Many organize real-life events to push their members outside. Outdoor-equipment companies including REI and Merrell are helping to fund or promote these new groups and leaders. Our public lands have a diversity problem. A report released in 2017 by the National Park Service showed that 78 percent of visitors were white. African-Americans, by contrast, represented 7 percent of visitors. In the same year, the Outdoor Industry Foundation found that while 34 percent of African-Americans participated in outdoor activities, among white people the percentage is 51 percent. “Come 2040, our country will have more people of color than white people,” said Ambreen Tariq, 36, who runs the Instagram account and website, Brown People Camping. “If these people aren’t going into the parks and green spaces, there won’t be anybody to be advocates and stewards,” she said. “We need people to get out there to love the land so they will fight to protect it.” In August 2016 Ms. Tariq, a Muslim who works in a policy and communications role for the federal government, went on a camping trip in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. “It was startlingly white,” she said. “There was diversity in the people I hung out with, the food I eat, my work, but not in this park.” She immediately started Brown People Camping to show Muslims hiking, climbing and camping. She also works with hiking experts to arrange group outings. Are efforts like these working? There are other positive signs besides the attention on Instagram. A recent study by Kampgrounds of America reported that of the 1.4 million households that camped for the first time in 2018, 51 percent of them are from non-white groups. And last year, an Outdoor Industry Association report concluded that outdoor participation among Hispanics has increased by an average 1.0 percent over the past five years and among Asians by 0.9 percent over the same time period. Ms. Bruso started Unlikely Hikers with a picture of herself from the backside, looking over a waterfall. “Calling all Unlikely Hikers and misfit nature lovers!” its caption read. “Despite how it may look in the commercials, magazines and other online nature communities, nature doesn’t care about your size, gender, race, ability, gear.” Her group hikes are as inclusive as possible. If someone needs to take a break, everybody takes a break. The slowest hiker sets the pace. She gets weekly requests from Instagram followers to organize hikes in their cities, and some have started informally organizing their own. Disabled Hikers was founded last year by Syren Nagakyrie, a 37-year-old disabled freelance writer and consultant based in Forks, Wash. She was tired of spending hours scouring guidebooks and online resources to find accessible trails. Now on her website, disabledhikers.com, she publishes trail reports and writes guide trails. She recently explored Olympic National Park in Port Angeles, Wash., to find trails sturdy enough for a wheelchair. She too also leads group hikes. “Unlikely Hikers was the first organization I had heard of to really break through into increasing diverse representation in the outdoors,” Ms. Nagakyrie said. “I have no doubt that without their work, it would be much more difficult for other projects and communities.” Large corporations are trying to bolster these grassroots initiatives. Ms. Bruso’s Instgram account became so influential that REI recruited her as a brand ambassador. She speaks at company events and shares positive brand messages to her audience, while the outdoor-gear company helps sponsor her events and posts her work to their social-media followers. “We understand that to be relevant in the world, we need to recruit younger, more multi-cultural audiences,” said Laura Swapp, REI’s director of experiences marketing. “We need to look at available market share and take these opportunities.” REI works with groups like Outdoor Afro, Brown Girls Climb and Latino Outdoors that organize climbing expeditions and activities for people of color. Pattie Gonia, a drag queen, is another brand ambassador, as is Mikah Meyer, an openly gay man who in April became the first person to visit in one continuous journey all 419 national parks in the United States. It took him 3 years. An influential way Ms. Bruso has advocated for women like her is to help convince REI to expand its plus-size clothing offerings. Last year she attended and spoke at trunk shows on the company’s behalf to get feedback from hikers about what they needed and wanted. “Sixty-five percent of women in the United States are over the size of 16, and the industry doesn’t design for them,” Ms. Swapp said. REI doubled its sale of apparel in extended sizes last year, and this year, plus-size clothes will be available in 21 stores, up from 16 in 2018 (the brand has 154 stores across the United States, so it still has a ways to go.) Reading about group hikes online led Bisa Myles, 45, to Tanzania and up Mount Kilimanjaro in March. Even though the plus-size, African-American woman loved the outdoors, she had never hiked before; none of her friends were ever interested. She signed up for the group climb — named the Curvy Kili Crew — after seeing a post from another plus-size woman about her hike up Kilimanjaro. Ms. Myles described the hike as “challenging, tiring, beautiful and the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done. “It’s not something I’ll stop now that the climb is over either,” she said. “I’ve really connected with it. It’s something I can do without feeling pressure. It’s not like working out, just about being fit. It’s about a new love of being outdoors.” She now leads hikes herself several times a year. 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian Modak, on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

2019,‘Vida’: Tanya Saracho on Colorism and the ‘Authenticity Police’,"Ask a showrunner The showrunner of the Starz drama, which returns Thursday, discusses her vision for Season 2. Starz’s splashy half-hour drama “Vida” begins with two Mexican-American sisters, Lyn (Melissa Barrera) and Emma (Mishel Prada) Hernandez, returning home to a gentrifying Eastside Los Angeles after the death of their mother. While dealing with their loss and the reality of the large debt their mother left behind, they encounter homophobia, wrestle with sexual identity and wade through the heavy emotional baggage that comes with complicated family relationships. And then there’s the secret wife their mom never told them about. In its short six-episode first season, “Vida” deftly covered a lot of ground — the show is an intimate look at the experiences of the grandchildren of immigrants and the struggle to balance being both Mexican and American. Season 2, premiering Thursday, delves even deeper into the sisters' performative bicultural identity. Tanya Saracho, the showrunner, said most of the writers — herself included — have encountered what she’s dubbed the “authenticity police.” “You’re not brown enough, you’re not light enough, you’re not Mexican enough. Your Spanish is not good enough,” she explained. On the flip side, “We are steeped in the dominant culture. It reminds us of our otherness every day.” In a recent phone interview, Saracho discussed being a first-time showrunner, tackling colorism in the new episodes and making her television directing debut. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. During Season 1, you posted on social media about the uneasiness you felt being a new showrunner. Did you have mentors for that process? I didn’t have mentors, but I did have people who held my hand. There were technical things, like — what kind of camera [to use]? Those kinds of things that I didn’t know about, I felt that it was O.K. to ask. Even though I’d done a showrunner training program and learned about budgets from John Wells in a one-day workshop, that’s not enough [time]. Everybody around me was a woman and maybe there’s something to that, that I didn’t feel dumb asking my producer Robin Schwartz, “What does that mean?” or “How do we hire a line producer?” [Starz] said, “Show us what you want it to look like.” I made a whole presentation, but mostly I said, “I want it to feel this way.” Some people, because they’ve been around cameras a long time, they know shorthand they can say on set. I don’t have training in this. Theater is my training. They did give me a pilot presentation where it felt like a great crash course for showrunning because we had to do everything from top to bottom, hire all the same positions. Aesthetically, it was a time where I could learn to communicate with a director. Because I had a specific way I wanted it to look. What motivated those choices you made for the visual style? I wanted it to feel [insidery]. A lot of times when we watch our communities represented on the screen, it feels like a museum piece. Like we’re coming to watch a safari. But that’s an outsider’s point of view. Also our skin color — I find that TV whitewashes our different shades; they wash the diaspora out of us. Latinx [a gender-neutral term for Latinos] — we are all subtones and undertones, and they just wash it out with a blue, or something bright. Or they brownface us even more. They just saturate us. I wanted it to look like us, but also to give it that prestige of an indie film. This season, you directed an episode for the first time. Why did you pick the finale? At the end of the last season, Marta Fernandez, my executive at Starz was like, “You should direct next season.” I was like, “Yeah, I do want to direct like fourth or fifth season.” She was like, “No, just direct next season. You’ll be fine. You will have support.” When we came to set up the season, the one that made the most sense to direct, so that I could finish my showrunning duties, was the last one. But I was just as scared because I was like, “Hold on, that’s the finale. I don’t want my finale to suck.” It was like this looming thing at the end. It was a source of anxiety, but then it was the best experience. I’ve directed 16 plays in the theater. And I forgot, “Oh, that’s right. I’ve directed actors. I’ve done that part.” My favorite part was sitting and editing my own stuff. All the stuff I was scared about, like not knowing [camera] angles, running out of time for a scene — none of that happened. So I’ve got the bug now. I want to do it again and again. Only for my shows — I don’t want to mess up somebody else’s show — and maybe a movie. Now the possibilities are endless, and I have to thank Marta for making me do it. Can you talk about the Spanglish that’s used on the show? There are opinions on the type of Spanglish we use. It’s so complicated because it’s a made-up way of communicating and there’s not one uniform way. There’s no dictionary that you could look at. It’s how we communicate and if you hear us, the writers, like in our texts — the California Spanglish is just very different from the Tex-Mex stuff. Also, it’s generational. But every character has had a cadence and a rhythm since the beginning. Eddy has a different kind of Spanglish than Mari; Eddy’s older. Eddy still says “carnal,” “firme” — words that Mari should not say. And with marketing, too. The fact that we get the words desmadre and chingona on the key art and teaser art, to me it’s radical. It’s revolutionary because not even every Latino is going to know what desmadre is — it's something like a “hot mess.” Mexicans and Mexican-Americans haven’t gotten a chance to see themselves like that in key art. On Latino TV shows, we rarely see Afro-Latinos. Is that something you thought about in regards to casting? Not for this show. I’ve been very aware of this and I’m in full agreement with you. My next show I’m developing is called “Brujas” and it’s all Afro-Latinx leads. I just had a mini writers’ room for [the pilot] and it was all Afro-Latinx writers. In the “Brujas” writers’ room, we talked about how proximity to whiteness becomes the goal. Our culture’s colonized. All of us. Have you heard of the notion of “hay que mejorar la raza,” meaning “You have to better the race”? A lot of Afro-Latinx suffer from their mothers or fathers saying, “Marry lighter, marry white so we can better the race.” We have that in us, in our culture. In this season of “Vida” I wanted to touch on the notion of being prieto, and how colorism is alive and well in the Latinx community. All that is our shame, our stuff that we haven’t aired out that much. And I love when we get to air it out.",The New York Times
2019,‘Vladimir Putin’ Talk Show in U.K. Prompts Sharp Intake of Breath in Russia,"LONDON — Whether it be the suspicion that he meddled in the Brexit referendum or the accusation that he ordered the poisoning of a former spy, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia stirs strong emotions in Britain. Now, the BBC is hoping to mine the Russian leader’s fame — or infamy — with a comedy series presented by a digital effigy of Mr. Putin, who cackles in a trailer for the program that his next great geopolitical victory will be to host the “No. 1 chat show in the U.K.” The satirical show, called “Tonight With Vladimir Putin,” uses a three-dimensional cartoon of Mr. Putin interviewing real guests in front of an audience, the BBC announced on Wednesday. Whether the Kremlin will see the funny side is debatable. “He doesn’t often get mocked and I don’t think that he’ll like it,” said Joanna Szostek, a lecturer in political communication at the University of Glasgow. “It’s not going to help bilateral relations, obviously,” Dr. Szostek added, noting that Moscow was likely to see the show as politically motivated because it considered the BBC a propaganda arm of the British government. The tone of the show could feed the Kremlin narrative that Western criticism of Mr. Putin was driven by an anti-Russian agenda, she said. The Putin caricature begins the trailer provocatively. “Greetings, people of the ‘United Kingdom’!” the digital puppet yells outside Buckingham Palace, miming air quotes in a less-than-subtle reference to the bruising political battles around Britain’s departure from the European Union and the fractious elections for the European Parliament that are being held this week. In the first episode, planned to air on June 14, “Mr. Putin” — or “everybody’s favorite bear-wrestling global strongman,” as the BBC described him — will meet Alastair Campbell, the onetime spokesman for former Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the next episode, the digital host will try “to get his head around feminism” in a discussion with the comedian and podcaster Deborah Frances-White, according to the statement. The sharp intake of breath from observers of Russian politics was almost audible after the BBC’s announcement. Comments on Twitter from Moscow-based journalists and researchers included a face-palm emoji in reaction to the puppet’s accent and a warning that the broadcaster was “playing with fire.” In Russia, such a caricature would be unthinkable nowadays. A show in the 1990s on the Russian network NTV, called “Puppets,” featured a cartoon figure of Mr. Putin and other prominent politicians, including former President Boris Yeltsin. But the show was discontinued soon after Mr. Putin assumed the presidency in 2000, and nothing like it has been shown on television since. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, dismissed the BBC show in a conference call with journalists on Thursday. “Lots of books have been written about Putin, lots of caricatures have been drawn, lots of puppets and cartoons have been created,” he said. “Putin hasn’t read books about himself or looked at caricatures,” Mr. Peskov added. “He doesn’t want to take after them. Let these caricatures take after him.” Russia Today, the English-language network that is widely seen as part of the Kremlin’s propaganda machine, also raised an arched eyebrow. “The show appears to be a regurgitated dystopian nightmare,” the Russian broadcaster said on its website. “Surprisingly, many people were able to overcome bouts of nausea and cringe-induced spasms long enough to air their disgust,” the article said, citing negative reaction on Twitter. A spokeswoman for the BBC said on Wednesday that the show’s creators would not be available to comment. An earlier version of this article misstated the day that the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov talked with journalists. It was Thursday, not Friday.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Walking on Water’ Review: The Artist Christo Thinks Big, as Usual","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Short on details but long on delight, “Walking on Water” follows the artist Christo as he creates one of his large-scale art installations. This cinéma-vérité documentary centers on “The Floating Piers.” That project, an orange-hued, three-kilometer floating walkway on Lake Iseo in Northern Italy, had been planned for decades and was eventually built in 2016. Like the artist’s “Wrapped Reichstag” in Berlin in 1995 or “The Gates” in New York City’s Central Park in 2005, the work was dissembled shortly following its completion, this time after 16 days. All of these ephemeral projects are “totally useless,” Christo says, declaring that the only reason he makes such things is because he enjoys seeing them. That disarming, pretension-free attitude runs throughout the film, save for a few scenes when problems arise and are soon overcome. The director Andrey Paounov culled through hundreds of hours of footage, much of it shot by others, to assemble the documentary. There are no interviews, nor discussion of Christo’s creative partner and wife, Jeanne-Claude, who died in 2009. Instead we spy on an artist who races around like a mad scientist, and who seems comically befuddled by technology. His passion is genuine, as is his sense of wonder. With the immense effort that goes into “The Floating Piers,” you can’t help wanting to know more about its construction and funding, and about Christo’s life and background. But “Walking on Water” leaves those for you to research later. Like the artist and his work, this film lives in the now.

2019,‘We Are So Secretive’: How Nicole Dennis-Benn Depicts Working-Class Life,"In her new novel, “Patsy,” the writer tells an immigration story that defies conventions of motherhood and sexuality. Over a lunch of oxtail, rice and peas, and sorrel punch on one of the first warm days of spring, Nicole Dennis-Benn’s sunny disposition came through quickly. The writer, 37, wore a turquoise, yellow and orange printed dress with bangles, and in conversation her responses — “I love it!” “Yes!” “So true!” — were just as bright and upbeat. Her fiction is another story. “Here Comes the Sun,” her 2016 debut, explores sex tourism at a beach resort in her native Jamaica. Her new novel, “Patsy,” out on Tuesday, takes on similarly heavy themes, including reluctant motherhood, the harsh realities of immigration and the challenge of coming into one’s gender and sexual identity. Its title character dreams of emigrating from Jamaica to New York and reuniting with Cecily, the woman she loves. But part of the life Patsy leaves behind includes her 5-year-old daughter, Tru. The book alternates between their perspectives. For Dennis-Benn, who now lives in Brooklyn with her wife, Emma, “Patsy” feels more personal than “Here Comes the Sun.” “I was always on the outside, coming out as a lesbian,” Dennis-Benn said. “That’s how Patsy and Tru feel, like they’re outsiders, looking in.” Originally planning to become a doctor, Dennis-Benn studied pre-med at Cornell and earned a master’s in public health at the University of Michigan. It wasn’t until she was working at Columbia University as a project coordinator and met Emma that she started to see writing as a potential career. “I was still in the immigrant mind-set,” she said, before Emma challenged it. “I always see you writing at nights. Are you really a writer?” Dennis-Benn recalled her saying. “She was the one who introduced me to M.F.A. programs.” Ahead of her new novel’s release, she talked about her immigration story, how she writes authentic Jamaican characters and more. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Why did you want to tell this story? I was an adjunct at CUNY, teaching at the College of Staten Island. I had to wake up really early in the morning to travel on the subway and the Staten Island Ferry. I realized I was on the train with all these Caribbean immigrants, and right above our heads would be ads saying, “Come to Jamaica” or “Come to the D.R.” “Come to Bahamas.” And here we are in New York City, hustling. It was cold. The questions started coming to me: “Who were these people before they left their country? What parts of themselves did they carry? What parts of themselves did they leave behind?” That’s when Patsy came to me — this woman who wanted so badly to be in America, a country that was sold to many of us as a fantasy, but then realizes that, if immigrants don’t have the education or the legal status, they’re doing the jobs that Americans are rejecting. One of the crushing realities I know personally is of cousins and family members who came here and went through the Rolodex in our mind, like, “Did we ever hear from Jamaicans or anybody that we’d have to clean toilets?” And the answer would be no. As I started writing this immigrant story, I realized that this woman is not here to give back to her family. She’s here to be a new person. That was when the story opened up, like, “Oh my goodness, she left a whole child behind.” That was challenging for me to write. Why was it challenging? Because I found myself judging Patsy. Even though I was creating it, it is jarring, because I felt like, “Wow, this is a woman doing this.” But in my imagination, I always thought, “How about if I write a woman who feels that she couldn’t own that motherhood role? And taking her to the extent where she actually abandons this child?” Patsy didn’t have a choice to begin with. Abortion is illegal in Jamaica, and so a lot of women end up just having their babies, whether or not they want to be mothers. I wanted to explore that part of motherhood and see how that story would unfold. How do you navigate that, judging your characters? I write through it. Sometimes I take breaks, maybe a week or two to really assess, “What am I really judging?” For example, with the motherhood part, I’m judging this woman who absolutely cannot embrace her role as a mother. Realizing I had to really unpack my own upbringing, my own socialization as a Jamaican woman — or a woman, in general — and then move forward. Why did you include the perspective of Patsy’s daughter, Tru? I wanted to show the child who was left behind in Jamaica. Usually people say to them, “You ought to be grateful, at least they’re going to America to send back things for you.” They don’t speak about that sense of loss or abandonment. I wanted to get into the psychology of this person who’s coming of age, coming into their own identity and questioning the abandonment. And also, too, an individual who is gender nonconforming. Tru doesn’t fit into this box of femininity, of womanhood, but has no guide, no one else who is actually like her. What are the challenges of writing about the negative parts of your culture and your home — the homophobia, for instance — knowing that this will be for broad consumption? I always think about James Baldwin when I get asked that question, in that he said he loved America so much that he could criticize it. I feel the same way about Jamaica. I love my country. I do write the beauty of it, but I also don’t shy away from those issues that are the reasons I left to begin with — homophobia, classism, racism, displacement. I’m writing to hold up that mirror. I want to talk a little bit about the use of Jamaican patois. Why did you decide to write in dialect? We’re told in Jamaica not to use patois in public. It was so ingrained that, even now, I have to remember, like, “Oh yeah, I do have that language.” So this was kind of a rebellious act. As an artist, I have that power to say, “I’m going to put it back into my work, to preserve it.” I want to write authentic Jamaican characters, and I’m not going to write two Jamaican characters talking to each other without using our language. Growing up, I never read characters who looked like me, who sounded like me. For me, it’s important to do this for another person, for another woman of color, another Jamaican to see that our people exist on the page. I tap into issues that could actually be anybody’s experiences, regardless of who they are, their culture, their race, their background: motherhood, sexuality, class and colorism. I want to tap into those things but actually use protagonists who look like me — queer, black, working-class Jamaicans. What are the challenges of writing working-class characters? We have so many great stories, but we are so secretive. Look at our young girls, for example — there are so many big issues that we are grappling with, but we’re not able to talk about them, because society respects our silences and shame more than our voices. Now, having this privilege to tell our stories, I’m telling the stories of my mother, my grandmother, the women around me and a society that was colonized, where we were taught to hate ourselves and the sound of our own voices. To know that I have this power, it’s like, “Let me actually tell those stories we were taught not to share with the world.” Follow New York Times Books on Facebook and Twitter (@nytimesbooks), sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

2019,"‘We Have Always Lived in the Castle’ Review: An Arch, Feminist Fairy Tale","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “We Have Always Lived in the Castle,” a playfully arch and unsettling film based on Shirley Jackson’s 1962 novel, there’s nobody obvious to root for; everyone is dour, foolish, phony or deranged. Possibly even murderous. Under Stacie Passon’s precise direction, this gothic fable of isolation and violence expertly treads a fine line between tragedy and camp. Merricat (Taissa Farmiga), still childlike at 18, lives in the cavernous Blackwood family chateau with her older sister, Constance (Alexandra Daddario), and their sickly Uncle Julian (a reliably furtive Crispin Glover). The girls’ parents died several years ago after eating a suspicious meal that left Uncle Julian debilitated and the sisters shunned. Constance, unfailingly coifed and composed, makes do as a dutiful homemaker, baking pies and canning fruit with a glistening smile plastered on her pretty face. A skulking, slouching Merricat endures the taunts of the townspeople when she makes weekly trips for provisions, rushing home to bury trinkets in the castle’s enormous garden and casting protective spells. The sisters take care of each other; they cuddle in bed and fantasize about living on the moon, which hangs outside of Merricat’s window like a cartoon cutout. Their home is full of lush fabrics, gorgeous wallpaper and a worrying number of candles. (Piers McGrail’s cinematography makes the tableaus look like twisted photo spreads from Life magazine.) Farmiga’s Merricat speaks in a clipped cadence that sounds both creepy and competent; her knowledge of mushroom toxicology is troublingly comprehensive. Uncle Julian silently glides into the frame in his wheelchair, suddenly reciting cryptic lines from the family history he’s writing. Constance tends to the house in what appears to be a state of willful oblivion, looking cheerful and stunned. The delicate balance of the household is upended with the arrival of Charles (Sebastian Stan), a dashing cousin who seems helpful at first but whose authoritarian streak reveals itself when he takes an aggressive interest in Merricat’s buried treasures and starts calling Constance “Connie.” (Having him chug milk from the carton is also a nice touch.) Like the jeering men in the town, Charles turns out to be an entitled patriarch; under every languid grin lies a leer and a smirk. Mark Kruger’s screenplay isn’t subtle, but then neither is Jackson’s novel — a sharp, demented fairy tale in which the women live happily ever after despite the men, rather than because of them. The outside world is cruel, capricious, inhospitable; only when the sisters lock themselves inside their crumbling castle can they truly be free.

2019,‘We Have a Lot of Questions’: Doubts Loom Over G.M. Plan for Lordstown Plant,"It has all the elements of a classic Trump tale: intervention with an otherwise heartless company, a saved factory in the heartland, and assurances that old-school manufacturing jobs would be preserved. On Wednesday, the factory in question was the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Mr. Trump announced that it was being sold to a little-known maker of electric vehicles, Workhorse Group, and that G.M. was making a new investment in the state. “I have been working nicely with GM to get this done,” he wrote on Twitter. “With all the car companies coming back, and much more, THE USA IS BOOMING.” But for all the seemingly good news in Ohio, which has been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs, the president’s record in delivering on such deals suggests that caution is warranted. He helped persuade Carrier to keep a factory in Indianapolis open in 2016, but the company still cut roughly half of the jobs at stake there. In 2017, he said Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics supplier, would invest $10 billion to build a manufacturing complex in Wisconsin. The company was supposed to create 13,000 jobs — positions that have proved illusory. Mr. Trump’s 2018 assertion that “Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan” was a stretch by any measure. Workhorse, a small company based near Cincinnati, makes battery-powered pickup trucks, delivery vans, drones and aircraft, faces big obstacles in getting the Lordstown plant humming again with hundreds working the line. It has no experience in mass vehicle production, its shares recently traded for less than $1, and quarterly revenues were less than the price of one high-end sports car. “This president is no stranger to grandiosity when it comes to job claims,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a partnership between employers and the steelworkers’ union. “Foxconn is in limbo and virtually no one believes it will live up to the billing.” Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, noted that Workhorse employs fewer than 100 people, compared with the thousands who worked for G.M. in Lordstown as recently as April 2018. “It’s still too early to tell whether the sale is good news for workers,” he said in an interview. It is not clear whether G.M. will strike a deal. The company said it was in discussions to sell the plant to a new business partly owned by Workhorse and headed by that company’s founder and former chief executive, Steve Burns. G.M. said the deal had the potential to bring “significant” production and assembly jobs to the plant. The number, however, would likely be far fewer than G.M. employed, given Workhorse’s size. Separately, G.M. said it would invest $700 million in three other Ohio cities — Toledo, Parma and Moraine — creating about 450 manufacturing jobs. The company also said on Wednesday that it would invest $130 million to keep 300 jobs at a plant in Oshawa, Ontario, that it had planned to close. G.M. announced in November that it would stop production at five North American factories, including Lordstown and Oshawa, and lay off 14,000 workers. Since then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized the automaker, particularly over Lordstown. In March, he demanded that G.M. reopen the factory or sell it “to a company who will open it up fast!” During the 2016 election campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to increase automotive jobs in the United States, and Ohio was a key state in his victory. For more than 50 years, life in Lordstown, Ohio, revolved around the G.M. plant at the edge of town. In March, the plant ceased production. This is what their crisis looks like. Like the Carrier plant in Indiana, Lordstown took on political symbolism for a president who has repeatedly promised to restore American manufacturing jobs and industrial prowess. At a rally in nearby Youngstown in 2017, he declared: “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house.” Nationally, the manufacturing sector has done well since he took office, but in Ohio, factory employment remains 10 percent below where it was before the recession. In halting the Lordstown plant’s output of the Chevrolet Cruze — G.M. said the factory had been “unallocated” — the company eliminated 1,600 jobs. Some 700 of the Lordstown workers have found positions at other G.M. factories as of this month, the company said. Sales of the Cruze have dwindled over the last few years as consumers gravitated away from small cars in favor of trucks and sport utility vehicles. G.M. said it was discussing its Lordstown plans with the United Automobile Workers. A spokesman for Workhorse, Tom Colton, said the company and the new affiliate that would own the plant intended to use unionized labor. But the union appeared to be skeptical of the deal and called on G.M. to resume operations at the Ohio plant. “General Motors should assign a product to the Lordstown facility and continue operating it,” Terry Dittes, the union’s vice president, said in a statement on Wednesday. G.M. and the U.A.W. are scheduled to start talks on a new labor contract in July. Automakers have in the past agreed to production commitments in exchange for cost reductions from the union. Workhorse was founded in 1998 to take over production of delivery vans that G.M. had dropped from its lineup. Workhorse was acquired by Navistar in 2005 and later sold to AMP Holding, which changed its name to Workhorse Group after the acquisition. The company’s customers include UPS and FedEx, and it has several thousand orders for its electric trucks. It is hoping to win a contract to supply delivery vehicles to the United States Postal Service. But Workhorse has struggled financially while preparing to increase production. In January it borrowed $35 million from a hedge fund, Marathon Asset Management. Its stock price increased by more than 200 percent on Wednesday to close at $2.65. Mayor Arno A. Hill of Lordstown, a Republican, said he was “elated” by the news, but acknowledged it was early in the process. “We have a lot of questions,” he said. “We’d like to find out how many people will be employed and the level of investment. We’re very optimistic that we could be on the leading edge of something here.” The Youngstown area has clawed its way back from being a byword for economic collapse, drawing new employers and a hotel downtown for the first time in decades. Still, the local economic picture is mixed. After inching higher amid the fracking boom in 2014, employment has edged down more recently. Decades of economic struggle have left some Ohioans cautious. “The president has a habit of tweeting things that turn out later to be either inaccurate or completely false,” said David B. Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Akron. “We have to wait and see and make sure what the president tweeted out is true and that it comes to fruition.” On the other hand, if the Lordstown plant does open under Workhorse’s auspices, Mr. Cohen said, “it will be a big win for the president.” It would also be good news for Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat whose district includes Lordstown, and who is one of the lesser-known contenders for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination. “It’s been so heartbreaking over the past few months,” Mr. Ryan said in an interview. “This has a lot of upside if we can get the deal inked and help this company grow.” A headline on an earlier version of this article misstated the name of the prospective buyer of the Lordstown plant. It is Workhorse, not Workhouse.",The New York Times
2019,‘We Knew What Was Coming’: Sri Lanka Sees ISIS’ Hand in Attacks,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — The suicide bombs were packed with ball bearings, iron nails and the explosive TATP, all hallmarks of the way the Islamic State likes to commit mass murder. One of the bombers had traveled to Syria. Another trained in Turkey. One man arrested hours after the attacks had commuted between Sri Lanka and Syria, leading investigators to identify him as a possible middleman between the Islamic State and Sri Lankan militants. As Sri Lankan investigators reveal key details from the suicide blasts that killed more than 250 people in churches and hotels across the island on Easter Sunday, more evidence points to a role by the Islamic State in inspiring — and perhaps directing — the slaughter. Even as the Islamic State has been routed from territories in Iraq and Syria where its black flag once flew with impunity, the Sri Lanka attacks show the group is still capable of orchestrating carnage through loyalists in far-flung countries. Few outside counterterrorism experts believed Sri Lanka was in imminent danger. But many Sri Lankans knew that the Islamic State was eyeing them. And some are furious that multiple warnings went unheeded. They feel their government essentially allowed more than 250 lives to slip between the cracks. In November 2016, the justice minister told Parliament that more than two dozen Sri Lankans had recently joined the Islamic State, which he said was becoming a “grave problem.” A few months later, a group of moderate Muslims presented police officials with 11 dossiers on local Islamist extremists, including Zaharan Hashim, whom they identified as the “leader of ISIS team in Sri Lanka.” Officials have identified Mr. Zaharan as one of the suicide bombers and possibly the ringleader. For years, moderate Muslims had expressed concern that Mr. Zaharan was tearing at Sri Lanka’s delicate fabric that spans its Muslim, Buddhist and Christian communities. They unsuccessfully urged the police to arrest him. Sri Lankan officials have blamed one another for dismissing detailed warnings about these threats. The fact that no one acted on the information about a growing Islamic State presence, just as no one acted in the weeks before the attacks on specific intelligence about possible suicide bombings, has compounded the grief and anger. “I’m frustrated, but more than that, I am pained,” said Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the former justice minister, who had spoken in Parliament more than two years ago about the Islamic State’s foothold. “I was carefully watching their movements. I knew the Islamic State was preparing for an attack here. Nobody listened.” Sri Lankan officials say they are “95 percent finished” with the investigation and feel confident that they have arrested nearlyall the accomplices — 140 people have been identified as suspects — and have recovered their explosives, found during several raids. Many new details of the attacks, including some that suggest a more active role by the Islamic State than just inspiration from afar, were told to The New York Times by a senior official involved in the investigation who has also been briefed about foreign intelligence on the Islamic State. The senior official, like several others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. All the bombers were identified by officials as Sri Lankan. And investigators said that Achchi Mohamed Mohamadu Hassthun, seen on video footage coolly walking into St. Sebastian’s Church on Easter Sunday wearing a large backpack, was the bomb maker. Investigators said that they had found bomb-making manuals on his computer and that he may have trained in Turkey. According to the senior Sri Lankan official, Mr. Hassthun built 11 TATP bombs in a garage in a suburb south of the capital, Colombo, using ordinary household materials, including huge bottles of glue. Triacetone triperoxide, commonly known as TATP, is the explosive of choice for ISIS bombers, including those behind the deadly attacks in Paris in November 2015. Another bomber, Abdul Latheef Jamil, had traveled to Syria. But investigators suspect he might have been radicalized earlier in Australia, where he studied aeronautical engineering. The authorities believe that Inshaf and Ilham Ibrahim, sons of one of Sri Lanka’s wealthiest spice traders, possibly financed the whole plot. In a final voice mail to his wife, the authorities said, Inshaf listed the money owed to him from various people, provided advice on which of the couple’s cars to sell, and told her, “I am going to God.” Sri Lankans remain puzzled why some of their most privileged young men would do this. But the Islamic State ideology’s allure to some of Sri Lanka’s most well-to-do families has been known for years. “These are not individuals from normal Muslim families,” Mr. Rajapakshe told Parliament in his 2016 speech. Mr. Rajapakshe said he had based his claims on detailed information provided by moderate Muslims and government intelligence officers. He and others said it made sense because affluent Sri Lankans had more time and resources to surf the internet and find extremist material than those who had to devote all their energies to making ends meet. Still, Mr. Rajapakshe said, after he gave his speech, he was ridiculed as an anti-Muslim bigot. Sri Lankan officials said the first Sri Lankans joined the Islamic State in 2013 or 2014, around the time the group declared its caliphate straddling Syria and Iraq. Back then, Daya Ratnayake was Sri Lanka’s army chief, and he said the military and intelligence establishment was paying close attention. “We knew what was coming,” he said. He said that the military established special groups to follow radical university students and online postings. He said the government deported more than 100 radical Islamist preachers, many from Pakistan. And he was aware that Mr. Zaharan’s group on Sri Lanka’s eastern coast was alienating moderates and conservatives alike. “Our message to the moderates was to keep these radicals with you, don’t kick them out, don’t isolate them,” he said. But that’s exactly what happened. After Mr. Zaharan’s followers attacked worshipers of the Sufi sect, he evaded arrest and disappeared. In 2015, the Sri Lankan government confirmed its first case of a homegrown Islamic State fighter. Mohamed Muhsin Sharhaz Nilam, a well-respected school principal and karate instructor from central Sri Lanka, was killed in a coalition airstrike in Syria. Around this time, Sri Lanka’s politics were in upheaval. Voters threw out President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the strongman who brought Sri Lanka’s decades-long civil war to a brutal end in 2009, and elected Maithripala Sirisena, a career politician from humble roots who presented himself as a democratic reformer. Independent analysts say that Mr. Sirisena was too quick to move Sri Lanka off its military footing and that he sidelined many good intelligence officers. Experts who track the Islamic State’s media operations said they had seen few if any specific mentions of Sri Lanka before the Easter attacks. The Islamic State had said plenty about slaughtering Christians, but its focus was the Middle East, Europe and, more recently, West Africa. The Islamic State’s claim of responsibility for the Sri Lanka attacks, and its release of a video showing Mr. Zaharan pledging allegiance to the group’s leader, seemed to prove that they at least had maintained contact. Further, to make the devastating bombs used in Sri Lanka, most experts believe that experienced Islamic State operatives must have helped. “You need expertise to make the bomb, expertise for the detonators, expertise for the selection of the sites and how to indoctrinate people to kill themselves,” said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, Indonesia. “All that,” she said, “takes face-to-face training.” Sri Lankan investigators say they are still trying to determine how that might have happened. Officials believe that a Sri Lankan man named Sadiq, who has been arrested, traveled to Syria several times and served as Mr. Zaharan’s right-hand man. They also suspect that the Islamic State encouraged or directed the local group to attack churches. Before the Easter attacks, there had been little Muslim-Christian strife in Sri Lanka. Adherents of both religions are small minorities compared with the country’s Buddhist majority. Investigators say that all the bombs in packs worn by the attackers were triggered by pulling a strap. Another bomb had been placed outside one of the churches, timed to explode around 90 minutes after the first explosions, for the purpose of killing the emergency teams and officials who rushed to the scene. It failed to detonate.",The New York Times
2019,"In Istanbul Election Do-Over, Erdogan’s Opponents Unify","The decision by Turkish authorities to wipe away a stinging defeat for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and rerun the election for mayor of Istanbul left the opposition angered but determined on Tuesday to win the race a second time. Ekrem Imamoglu, the opposition candidate who narrowly won the March 31 election, only to have that victory annulled on Monday, announced on Tuesday that he would run again, and rallied his supporters by retweeting a message from his party’s Twitter account that said, “We will win again.” The move by Mr. Erdogan to overturn the election results quickly reverberated through Turkey and beyond. Sporadic protests broke out Monday evening after the announcement, and the lira, a barometer of the way foreign investors regard the country, declined sharply on Tuesday — down 5 percent from earlier in the week. The decision by the High Electoral Council, which cited irregularities in how officials were chosen to oversee voting at some polling stations, left the opposition with the difficult decision of whether to take part in a new election that it considers illegitimate. Boycotting the vote would have handed control of the country’s financial capital and largest city back to the president and his party. Instead, Mr. Imamoglu and the opposition made the choice to compete in a new election, scheduled for June 23, even as they denounced it an affront to democratic principles. “Our democracy has been struck a great blow,” Mr. Imamoglu told reporters on Tuesday in Ankara. “We should all fix this process together.” Early Tuesday, several minor candidates announced that they would withdraw from the race, in an apparent effort to forge a united front and throw their support behind Mr. Imamoglu. That could tip the balance in a race that was decided the first time by a razor-thin margin, less than 0.2 percent of the vote. Mr. Imamoglu’s win over Binali Yildrim, the candidate of the governing Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., was an embarrassing blow to Mr. Erdogan in his home city. Mr. Erdogan was voted in for another five-year term as president last year, with sweeping new powers, strengthened by recent changes to the constitution. But political analysts say the opposition wins in several cities in March, including Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, infuriated Mr. Erdogan. The president and the A.K.P. alleged irregularities and petitioned for a new vote. After an initial recount of some contested districts in the city, election officials certified Mr. Imamoglu as the winner, and he entered office in April. But in a stunning reversal, the High Election Council ruled, 7 to 4, on Monday in favor of the governing party and called a new vote. The move drew criticism in the country and abroad as the latest example of Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarian overreach and a blow to Turkey’s democratic foundation. The governor of Istanbul will act as interim mayor until the election. Mr. Erdogan addressed lawmakers in Parliament on Tuesday, saying the nation could not ignore “unlawfulness” in the election. “I believe the people of Istanbul will make the right decision on June 23,” he said. “We consider this decision that cleaned up the shadow over the Istanbul elections as a step to strengthen our democracy.” On Tuesday, lawmakers from the Republican People’s Party, the opposition party of Mr. Imamoglu, gathered in Ankara to plot a way forward. “Everything is going to be very fine,” the party’s leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, told reporters outside the party headquarters, according to the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet. “Despite everything we will bring democracy to this country.” In a televised speech Monday night, Faik Oztrak, a party spokesman, had used similar language as he denounced the decision to rerun the election as an attack on legitimate democracy. Considering the narrow margin between Mr. Imamoglu and Mr. Yildirim, the withdrawal of the other opposition candidates, who took a combined 2.6 percent of the vote, could make a difference. The Turkish Communist Party withdrew its candidate, and the Communist Movement and Labour Movement Party, two groups whose candidates ran as independents, announced that they would also withdraw. One of the biggest points of criticism of the council’s decision to invalidate the results was that it applied only to the result of Istanbul’s mayoral election, not the many lower offices that were contested at the same time. Meral Aksener, the head of a nationalist party that supported Mr. Imamoglu, raised that question when addressing lawmakers in Parliament Tuesday. “In those envelopes there were four ballots. Four ballots under the jurisdiction of the same ballot box officials,” she said. “Choosing only the metropolitan municipality votes and canceling those ones — how can you explain it?” Some analysts said Mr. Erdogan’s decision to dispute the election could damage him in the long term and was likely to increase support for the opposition. Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the German Marshall Fund in Ankara, a policy institute, said that Mr. Erdogan was not merely gambling, but playing Russian roulette. “The stakes are very high. The odds are against him,” Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. “This is a question about whether Erdogan is willing to pay a long-term political price to take Istanbul.” The political turmoil has worsened an already precarious economic situation in Turkey. Inflation is at almost 20 percent, eroding living standards at the same time that growth has stalled. Mr. Erdogan’s successful bid to nullify the Istanbul election results is certain to further undercut the confidence of the foreign investors whose money has fueled Turkish growth, but who have become increasingly disenchanted with his management of the economy. Every decline in the lira amplifies the country’s problems and heightens the danger of a vicious circle of rising prices and sagging growth. When the lira loses value, imported goods become more expensive, feeding inflation. Turkish companies that have borrowed money in dollars, a common practice, have more trouble repaying their loans as the lira they earn in sales decline in value. Bankruptcies in Turkey are already on the rise, straining Turkish banks. Business people complain that government agencies and courts are tilted in favor of Erdogan cronies. Yet, with another election pending, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to impose the austerity measures and other reforms that economists say are needed to tame inflation and prevent a credit bubble from bursting. Opposition protesters had rallied on the streets of Istanbul on Monday night after hearing the news of the new election, but by Tuesday, the streets were quiet.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘What Does Daddy Cry About?’,"Someday I will have to tell my son how his sister died. But not yet. Mr. Greene is a writer. In August our son, Harrison, will celebrate his third birthday. He is our second child, but we have never parented a 3-year-old before. As parents, my wife and I are beginners again. Four years ago, a brick fell from an eighth-story windowsill on the Upper West Side and hit our daughter, Greta, in the head, killing her. She was 2. Before Harrison turned 2, we had a reference point for his every move — when they each first walked, when they spoke their first words, when they started throwing tantrums. We compared their sleep, their behavior on the playground. Neither was physically adventurous; both started walking around 13 months, with the same floppy-limbed uncertainty. Both of them had a habit of swatting nervously at other children who got too close. We delighted in the ways they were similar to and different from each other. And then Harrison turned 2 years and 18 days old, and we entered uncharted territory. It is a bittersweet thing, watching Harrison learn to make connections Greta did not. Every week now, he reaches new milestones. He has curly hair and full lips and a stare that goes dark when he is hurt. He is highly attuned to the feelings of others — “That guy looks sad,” he informed me once in a Fairway, well within earshot of said grim-faced stranger. He laughs easily, grins wider and cries louder than any other child in the neighborhood. Watching him grow, I am occasionally reminded of how little we will ever know about Greta. Harrison’s personality is a public fact, but Greta’s own little tendencies remain only in her parents’ memories. Once, she was a person, imposing her will on the world. Now she is our lonely, private fact. Many of my superstitions surrounding Greta's accident have died down. I no longer cross the street to avoid passing under construction sites with Harrison. And when Harrison first smacked his face on the jungle gym, filling his mouth with blood, I remained calm — when my son reached for me, screaming, he saw no fear in his father's eyes. I don’t celebrate these small triumphs so much as note them with a kind of grim satisfaction before sprinting to keep Harrison from toppling face-first over his Big Wheel. Parenthood is a merciless second-by-second referendum on the person you’ve already become, and one of its biggest gifts to me has been its relentless grounding in the present. The essential truth of parenting is that there is no time for you: You are now a busy stagehand for someone else’s play. In some fundamental way, I've never been happier. My son is full of precise observations now. He will point to a flower and mention that it is just like the one in his book. Recently he pointed to a picture of Greta on the refrigerator. “That’s Harrison!” he said. I corrected him gently. “That’s Greta, buddy,” I said. He repeated her name in his little voice, which is still losing its toddler static. The moment reminded me, again, of a truth I am resisting. Some day — I don’t know when, only that it is drawing sooner — I will have to sit down and explain to him that he has a sister and why she is not here. When he was a baby, we would tell him about Greta, lightly and casually: Your sister loved bananas too. Your sister was a real pain about sleep. But he is older now, and I feel his keen, parsing intelligence observing my every word. I have learned something from my growing reticence to say her name: I am keeping her from him. It is not her life I want to keep secret, but the circumstances of her death. We wish to protect our children. I was unable to protect Greta. Now, having seen the brick destroy my first child, I must deliver the knowledge of the brick to my second. We will have to choose the moment in Harrison's life to introduce this crack into his foundation, and I will have no way of controlling where it goes inside him afterward. The accident will teach Harrison lessons I never want him to learn. It represents everything that is meaningless, malevolent and terrifying about the universe. I do not know how to tell him any of this, and so I stall for time, bargaining: Not yet. I watch Harrison run on the playground, chasing his two best friends up a slide and flopping down on his belly, laughing with his whole body. His hands are filthy and he runs over to me, demanding that I wipe them clean before running away again. Not yet. Harrison likes to reflect, lying awake in his crib at night, about all the things — the many, many things — that made him upset that day. He cried because the boy on the playground had a toy train and he didn’t. He cried because the ice cream truck didn’t stop. One night, while we both lay in the dark, he asked me, “What does Daddy cry about?” I froze: It was a Tuesday. My wife was due home from her hospital shift in about 20 minutes. My shoulders ached and there were still dishes piled in the sink. I was not ready to tell the truth. But I didn’t want my son to hear hesitation in his father’s voice, so I said, evenly: “Well, buddy, your daddy cries sometimes because he misses your sister, and he wishes she were here. But you make him feel better.” I waited a moment to measure the impact of these words. “Yeah,” he said, his voice thoughtful. He asked me, moments later, a question about Lightning McQueen. I don’t know how to do this — how to cultivate Harrison’s relationship to an absence, how to parent him next to someone invisible to him. I wait for signs from Greta. In moments of serenity I put myself back in the big open field in New Mexico where my wife and I retreated to prepare for Harrison's birth. There, the stars stretch endlessly, looming above like prehistoric creatures. The longer I stare at them, the more I hear the voices of both of my children. Harrison at my left, Greta at my right. In this place, I can say to them what needs saying. But I don’t live in that field; I live here. And here, Harrison is tugging at me, hard. He wants to play with dinosaurs; he badly needs me to sit right here — no, over here. It is important that I hold this dinosaur. I get down on my hands and knees and together we make dinosaurs roam the earth. Above our heads, on the wall, there is a painted portrait of our daughter, done by a friend. Harrison knows that this painting is called “Greta” and can point to it and say her name joyfully. He doesn’t know what it means yet, but then again, neither do I.

2019,"Opinion | ‘What Is the President Hiding, and Why?’","letters Readers discuss Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns and to let his advisers testify before Congress. To the Editor: Re “Secrecy Battle Builds as Judge Rebuffs Trump” (front page, May 21): President Trump’s fight against shining light on his financial dealings clearly indicates that he knows that any documents will show illegal business activities. It would be a simple matter to exonerate himself by making available his tax returns and his banking transactions. If there is nothing shady, he is innocent. If there is wrongdoing, he is best served by hiding the evidence. As Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform does have a legitimate legislative purpose: The Constitution gives the public the right to understand if and how the president is compromised in carrying out his presidential duties by his past business dealings. Other recent presidents have not had this issue because they have distanced themselves from business dealings and made available tax returns. We, the American public, have the right to understand why Mr. Trump fights so hard to keep us in the dark. Peter MithoeferArroyo Seco, N.M. To the Editor: Re “McGahn Skips Hearing, Defying Subpoena, and Democrats’ Anger Swells” (nytimes.com, May 21): It seems clear that the president of the United States is provably guilty of obstruction of justice. It also seems clear that President Trump continues to openly obstruct justice in every way at his disposal. Preventing the former White House counsel Don McGahn’s testimony is but the latest example. Mr. Trump’s supporters seem completely and oddly at peace with this. During the Watergate hearings Howard Baker famously asked, “What did the president know and when did he know it?” There is a better question at this moment that should be asked by every member of either party.

2019,‘When They See Us’ Transforms Its Victims Into Heroes,"Critic’s notebook Ava DuVernay’s mini-series depicts the excruciating toll that persecution and incarceration had on the teenage boys known as the Central Park Five. I was 13, a mere year younger than Kevin Richardson and Raymond Santana, two of the boys who made up Central Park Five, when they were wrongfully convicted of beating and raping the white female jogger Trisha Meili in 1989. I had just returned to the United States after living in my father’s country of Trinidad and Tobago for three years, and the televised melodramas that would cement my coming-of-age as a black woman — Anita Hill testifying at Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearings, the videotape of Los Angeles police officers beating Rodney King, the O.J. Simpson Bronco chase — had yet to happen. Back in 1989, I was still a novice to the rules and rituals of American racism. But, like so many other African-American and Latino kids who lived in the New York metropolitan area, I was about to get a primer: The Central Park jogger case. Because of my proximity to that trial, I thought I’d be prepared to watch “When They See Us,” Ava DuVernay’s four-part Netflix mini-series, debuting Friday, that depicts the horrifying events surrounding the case, and the excruciating toll the public persecution and swift conviction had on these teenage boys and their families. Instead, it took me two days to watch the first episode, and after each pause, I had to convince myself that I could sit through the next scene. This is not because this show lacks beauty or depth. It is thoughtfully cast, well-paced and visually stunning, thanks to DuVernay’s longtime collaborator, the cinematographer Bradford Young. In fact, “When They See Us” is DuVernay’s strongest work to date. But what makes it so devastating is its relentless portrayal of a criminal justice system that locks up, scapegoats and brutalizes black and brown American children with ease and enthusiasm. Part dirge, part indictment, the series stands out because it insists that we see the boys as they once were and as they always saw themselves: innocent. [Read an interview with the Central Park Five.] “When They See Us” is not the first project to delve into this subject matter. In 2003, Meili published a memoir, “I Am the Central Park Jogger: A Story of Hope and Possibility,” in which she publicly revealed her identity for the first time, recounted her ordeal, and said that she has no memory of her attack and has been told by doctors she never will. But, as a television mini-series, DuVernay’s project more directly benefits from the archival research found in the 2012 documentary “The Central Park Five,” directed by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon. Debuting at the dawn of President Obama’s second term, that film “positioned itself as something of a public pardon,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review. “Equal measures criminal investigation, cultural exhumation and a consideration of race in a presumptively postracial America, it seeks to set the record straight.” Seven years later, America looks very different. As a result, DuVernay’s story eschews the measured tone of the documentary for an outrage more akin to to Anthony Davis’s forthcoming opera, “The Central Park Five,” and Alexandra Bell’s new series of prints, “No Humans Involved — After Sylvia Wynter.” Appearing in this year’s Whitney Biennial, Bell’s photolithographs critique the media’s coverage of the Central Park jogger case — especially the New York Daily News and its racist headlines like “Park marauders call it ‘Wilding’” and “Wolf Pack’s Prey” — and the publishing of Donald Trump’s 1989 newspaper ad calling for the execution of these teenage boys. And it is the horror of Trump’s $85,000 full-page demand, and the heedless, racist rush to demonize children that it exemplified, that backdrops this mini-series. (This week offered a striking contrast in the form of President Trump’s Twitter response to Robert Mueller’s findings: “There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent.”) In the foreground, however, is a newer and even richer story: “When They See Us” restores the childhood innocence that the media, the police and prosecutors went to great lengths to deny and distort. It also grieves the years lost by the five victims, convicted as boys and released as men. Time is paramount here. Opening in medias res, the first episode does not begin in Central Park, but in the comfort and familiarity of the boys’ residential neighborhood of Harlem. Their playful banter and adolescent restlessness, and the youthful appearances of the actors, underscore the naïveté and vulnerability that enables them to be exploited and coerced into confessions by police officers who held and interrogated them on and off for 14 to 30 hours, often without their parents present. The second episode is even more harrowing because it follows the conspiracy — not the one boys are accused of, but the one mounted by the police and prosecutors who fudge timelines and overlook crucial evidence in order to expedite a guilty verdict. In the final two episodes, all but one of the boys is recast with an older actor, to mark how much they and the world have changed. (Korey Wise, the oldest of the boys, who was tried as an adult and sentenced to 5 to 15 years, is played throughout by a riveting Jharrel Jerome, known for “Moonlight.”) [Read the history of the Central Park Five case.] DuVernay has explored police brutality and mass incarceration before, in her film “Middle of Nowhere,” her Academy Award-nominated documentary “13th,” and her TV series “Queen Sugar.” But she uses time differently here, slowing it down enough for the viewer to feel the intensity of the boys’ bewilderment at their setup by the cops and then speeding it up as we watch these men adjust back to society, forever tainted by their experiences. The effect is a set of reversals in which DuVernay uses the conventions of the crime drama to upend our typical allegiances to police protagonists, and shift our gaze from the powerful to the targets of their institutional racism. In fact, this case was solved not by any rigorous police investigation, but by a chance encounter and an unusual admission of guilt. Twelve years after the five were convicted, Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist (with whom Wise had brief encounters in prison), confessed to prison officials that he was the one who attacked Meili. In 2002, after new DNA evidence corroborated Reyes’s version of the events, the Central Park Five’s convictions were vacated. And in 2014, they won a landmark $41 million settlement from the city. “No amount of money could have given us our time back,” Yusef Salaam, who was 15 at the time of his conviction, recently said in an interview. “When They See Us” does not pretend to make up for that lost time. Instead, it gives us something we haven’t yet fully seen: their humanity, and the intimacy these boys nurtured with their families and, over time, with each other in order to survive. By doing so, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Korey Wise and Yusef Salaam emerge as the heroes of their own story — and if we pay heed to the series’ urgent message about criminal justice reform, ours too.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Where the Crawdads Sing’ Still Rules the Fiction List. Over on Nonfiction, Though, Things Are in Flux.","Inside the List For the first time since his 1975 debut, “Black Sunday,” Thomas Harris has written a book that doesn’t include Hannibal Lecter, the erudite cannibal Stephen King once called “the greatest fictional monster of our time.” Lecter ruled the pages of “Red Dragon,” “The Silence of the Lambs,” “Hannibal” and “Hannibal Rising,” dining on the delicately prepared organs of his victims, but it’s a young woman, Caridad Mora, who drives the plot of Harris’s first novel in 13 years. “Cari Mora,” which has almost 350,000 copies in print, enters the fiction list this week at No. 3. “People are always asking me, ‘How do you think of these characters?’” Harris recently told The Times in his first substantive interview since the mid-1970s. “People ask you that when they can’t think of anything else to say. I respond that I don’t make anything up. So look around you. Because everything has happened.” Of his reluctance to talk to the press, Harris says, “I’ve been fortunate that my books have found readership without me promoting them, and I prefer it that way.” Going so many years without granting an interview made him a popular target for intrepid reporters. He has always rebuffed them politely, but it is perhaps worth noting that in “Red Dragon,” a serial killer glues a journalist to a wheelchair before biting off his lips and setting him on fire. The most interesting thing about the fiction list, though, is that Delia Owens’s “Where the Crawdads Sing” is still sitting at No. 1. The novel, which was published last August, got an initial boost from Reese Witherspoon, who picked it for her Hello, Sunshine book club. Since then it’s become a true word-of-mouth hit, sellling over one million copies. [ Dive into our summer reading package. ] Things are beginning to loosen up on the nonfiction list, which has been dominated for months by two memoirs: Michelle Obama’s “Becoming,” which was published in November, and Tara Westover’s “Educated,” which came out in February 2018. (Well over a year after its publication, “Educated” is still selling so strongly that it doesn’t yet have a paperback release date, which is almost unheard-of in the book industry.) Both “Becoming” and “Educated” are still in the top 10, but Mark R. Levin’s “Unfreedom of the Press” has seized the top spot (sending “Howard Stern Comes Again” to No. 2), and another new book, William H.

2019,‘Why Are So Many of Our Girls Dying?’ Canada Grapples With Violence Against Indigenous Women,"As violence against Indigenous women and girls grows, a national inquiry into the causes is drawing to a close, with a report expected on June 3. A mural in Winnipeg honoring missing and murdered Indigenous women.CreditCreditAaron Vincent Elkaim for The New York Times WINNIPEG — In the 24 hours before the disappearance of Tina Fontaine, a 15-year-old from the Sagkeeng First Nation in Canada, she was seen by provincial child welfare workers, police officers and health care professionals. Then she was found dead, dumped in Manitoba’s Red River, and wrapped in a plastic bag and duvet weighed down with 25 pounds of rocks. “Canada and the system failed Tina at every step,” Thelma Favel, the great-aunt who raised her, said on a recent day from her small home in Powerview, a sleepy town on Lake Winnipeg near the reserve of the Sagkeeng First Nation. “Why are so many of our girls dying?” Many in Canada have been asking that question. Tina’s death in 2014 — and the acquittal of a white man in her killing — was one of an increasing number of deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls that has shocked Canadians in recent years. The violence galvanized the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to open a $54 million national inquiry three years ago that promised to get at the root causes of the violence. Part of Mr. Trudeau’s pledge to overcome decades of “humiliation, neglect and abuse” of Indigenous populations, and to reconcile with them, the inquiry heard testimony from nearly 1,500 families of victims and survivors in often emotional hearings across the country. Its findings are to be made public on June 3, and its chief commissioner Marion Buller, a prominent Indigenous judge, recently hinted that it could include, among other things, recommendations that homicides of Indigenous women automatically be treated as first-degree murder. Law enforcement is also expected to be called to account. [For more Canada coverage in your inbox, sign up for the Canada Letter newsletter.] But some Indigenous advocates have said that, however good its intentions, the inquiry has been marred by a lack of transparency and poor communication with families of victims. “Justin Trudeau is trying to put rose-colored glasses on a very dark chapter of Canadian history,” said Kim O’Bomsawin, an Indigenous filmmaker whose documentary “Quiet Killing” examines violence against Indigenous women. “This is just more words.” Yet even before its release, the inquiry has been forcing a national reckoning. Among the cases attracting renewed scrutiny is that of Cindy Gladue, a 36-year-old Indigenous sex trade worker and mother of three who bled to death in a bathtub in an Edmonton motel room in June 2011; the man accused of her killing, Bradley Barton, an Ontario truck driver, was acquitted by an all-white jury. Human rights advocates say Ms. Gladue was dehumanized during Mr. Barton’s trial, including having her preserved pelvis introduced as evidence. After the Alberta Court of Appeal ordered a retrial in 2017, Mr. Barton appealed the decision to Canada’s Supreme Court, which ruled on Friday that he should be retried for manslaughter. Justice Michael Moldaver wrote that the criminal justice system has let Ms. Gladue down. The violence against Indigenous girls and women, experts say, is deeply rooted in Canada’s history. From the 1870s until 1996, Canada forced thousands of Indigenous children to go to residential schools in an effort to suppress their language and culture. Many faced physical, sexual and mental abuse. The trauma from this history has contributed, experts say, to persistently high rates of poverty, drug abuse, alcoholism, domestic violence and suicide. Cindy Blackstock, a professor of social work at McGill University, who is director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, said other problems were chronically underfunded social services for vulnerable girls and women and a lack of educational opportunities. The violence has been unrelenting. Indigenous women and girls make up about 4 percent of the total female population of Canada but 16 percent of all female homicides, according to government statistics. Some 1,181 Indigenous women were killed or went missing across the country between 1980 and 2012, according to a 2014 report by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. That number has since risen and Patricia Hajdu, who served as minister for the status of women, has estimated that it may be as high as 4,000 since many of the cases go unreported. The police have estimated that 10 percent of missing women in the country are Indigenous. Winnipeg, whose name is derived from the Cree words for “murky water,” has the largest Indigenous population in Canada. That is where Tina Fontaine’s life came to an end. Her history in many ways reflects the cycle of violence affecting Indigenous communities. Her paternal grandfather was sent to a residential school, and became an alcoholic. Her mother, who became a ward of the state as a child, eventually joined the sex trade. Ms. Favel said the child was “doomed before she was born.” Her mother was 12 when she began dating her father, who was then 23. After their chaotic relationship fell apart and Tina’s father was afflicted with cancer, Tina and her sister Sarah went to live with her. Ms. Favel said Tina was a happy girl who showed promise. She liked math and dancing, and television crime shows. She aspired to be a social worker. But at 12, the girl’s father, who only had four months to live, was beaten to death in an argument with two men over $60. Despairing, she began to skip school, smoke pot and cut herself. She got a tattoo with two angel wings and her father’s name on her back. When asked to write a victim’s impact statement during the trial of her father’s killers, she fell apart. “She kept crumpling the paper and said she couldn’t do it,” recalled Ms. Favel, on whose living room wall hangs a painting of Tina, waifish with big brown eyes. In June 2014, Tina left Ms. Favel’s home and went to Winnipeg, about 75 miles away, to visit her mother. Ms. Favel gave her $50 and a prepaid phone card, telling her to call if she wanted to come home. The call never came. Instead, she said, the girl texted photographs of herself with a black eye to her sister, saying that their mother, who was working in the sex trade, had beaten her. Alarmed, Ms. Favel said she reached out to three Manitoba family services agencies, which bickered over who was responsible. Eventually, Tina was placed by child and family services in a series of local motels, from which she ran away. She began living on the streets in Winnipeg’s impoverished north end. A missing person’s report was filed with Winnipeg police. On two occasions on Aug. 1, 2014, she was turned away from city shelters, according to a March report by the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth, which noted she was vulnerable to sexual exploitation. On Aug. 8, Winnipeg police pulled over a truck in which Ms. Fontaine was riding with an intoxicated man. The girl was allowed to go despite being the subject of a missing person’s report. Later that day, she was found unconscious in a back alley. After being hospitalized, testing positive for drugs and telling a case worker she was spending time with a much older drug user called Sebastian, she was discharged and placed at a Best Western Hotel in Winnipeg’s gritty downtown. The advocate’s report noted that the child abuse unit of the Winnipeg Police should have intervened. Instead, Ms. Fontaine left the hotel on her own. After Ms. Fontaine was found dead in the Red River, the police arrested Sebastian, whose real name is Raymond Cormier. The New Brunswick native had 92 previous convictions, including assault with a weapon and drug possession. During an elaborate sting operation, the police bugged his apartment and recorded him. Prosecutors said the recordings showed he had wanted to have sex with Ms. Fontaine and had been enraged after finding she was 15 years old. “I drew the line and that’s why she got killed,” he was overheard saying. The court also heard that Mr. Cormier had owned the same type of duvet that was wrapped around Tina’s body. But the autopsy failed to determine cause of death and there was no evidence of sexual assault and no forensic evidence linking Mr. Cormier to the crime. In February 2018, Mr. Cormier was acquitted of second-degree murder, spawning outrage and protests across the country. Visitors regularly pay tribute to Tina at a makeshift memorial of pink roses and photographs near the dock where her body was found. On a recent day, a card said: “sleeping beauty.” Ms. Fontaine’s legacy is also felt in other ways. After her death, volunteers routinely dredge the Red River looking for the bodies of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.",The New York Times
2019,‘Wild Animals Belong to All of Us’,"Q. AND A. Collet Ngobeni is a member of the Black Mamba Anti-Poaching Unit, the predominantly female team that patrols a private wildlife reserve in South Africa. This year marks the sixth anniversary of the Black Mamba Anti-Poaching Unit, South Africa’s predominantly female team of anti-poachers. Established in 2013, the 36 women patrol the Balule Nature Reserve, a 100,000-acre private wildlife reserve in northern South Africa, on the western boundary of Kruger National Park. The women, some of whom are as young as 18, are there to protect the country’s lions, pangolin, elephants and rhinos, whose horns are thought to have medicinal properties and can garner hundreds of thousands of dollars on the black market. The Mambas track about 78 miles of the park’s border for eight hours a day, looking for snares or traps, inspecting the border fence and searching cars for weapons or contraband. But while they may look like soldiers in their camouflage uniforms, the Mambas are completely unarmed. In addition to the pride of working in a traditionally male environment, being a Mamba gives the women the opportunity to show their children — especially their female children — that women can hold meaningful work outside of the home. Their beginning salary is about 3,500 South African rand, or about $224 dollars, monthly, with the chance to earn more the higher they go. Pandoro Safari Game Lodge and Roar Africa both offer tours to visit with the Mambas. “These women are part of the changing-face of the male-dominated safari industry, and without them our wild spaces and wildlife would perish,” said Deborah Calmeyer, Roar Africa’s founder and chief executive. Collet Ngobeni has been a Black Mamba since 2013. Now 34, Ms. Ngobeni lives in Bushbuckridge, a small community nearly two hours away from the Reserve, with her husband and two young children. When I grew up, I only knew that wild animals are for white people! They didn’t belong to black people. But that’s not true. Wild animals belong to all of us because it’s nature. I only knew that if you go to university, you need to be a teacher or doctor. We changed that mind-set. They can be a photographer. They can be anything that they like as long as they love it. We go to the school here, called Bush Babies, to educate these kids on nature. When they see us in schools, because of our uniforms they call us soldiers and they get excited to see us. They pay attention to us. We tell them that they must tell their parents that it’s not good to kill wild animals. We have people who have a lot of money — they check for the boys that are poor, then recruit them to be poachers. I was at home. I was not working. Now and then I heard news on the radio speaking about poachers and rhinos. I was not aware of anti-poaching; I wanted to be a guide or a tracker. So when I heard they want women to do the anti-poaching, I was very happy to be the one who applied. I wanted to give a change to my community. My husband was very positive about this. He said, ‘You are going to make a change in our communities and in our kids and in our future generations.’ My mother was scared. She said, ‘These people are going to kill you!’ I explained that it’s not only for me but for future generations. They need to see wildlife in real life, not in postcards. She is not scared anymore because she realized how great a job we are doing. My life is not in danger. These poachers are not in the reserve for the human beings, they are there for the animals. If they see us they don’t come after us. They just run away. I know how to interact in the bush. So, I don’t feel in danger when I’m in the bush. I don’t go alone. We work in a group. In 2014, I was with two of my colleagues patrolling the fence. There was a car parked next to the fence. They were outside the reserve and we were inside. If we see cars we greet them with smiles, but these people did not want to speak to us. They were poachers. I was scared. But we were not going to leave them there. We needed to show them that we are here with pride and we know what we are doing. They saw us try to take their number plate. We managed to scare them. They drove away. We have smartphones with an app that let’s everyone know where we are. When we go out to patrol we tell the others where we’re going. If we see rhinos we take pictures and send to the office so they know where to send people to patrol at night. The first one was very hard: They were training us how to survive in the bush without bathing — for seven weeks! That was very hard because we would wake up early in the morning, and run or walk along the fences. We made our houses with branches. They showed us how to interact when we see the Big Five [elephant, lion, leopard, rhinoceros and Cape buffalo]. The second training was two weeks. I stay in the reserve now for 21 days and go home for 10 days. People donated houses to us in the bush. We call them compounds. We share with two or three people. At first they thought it was a man’s job what we are doing. They were not giving us the respect they were supposed to give us. Now they see that this woman can do the job they are doing. When they see us they love us! Especially when we are at the gate doing road checks. Because in their lodges they tell them what we do in the reserve. We go there to educate those people that they don’t have to poach animals, or take firewood with them because it’s illegal.

2019,‘Wine Country’ Review: Searching for Laughs in a Midlife Bacchanal,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It’s hard not to feel like a party crasher while watching the sloppy comedy “Wine Country,” about a group of close friends on a getaway. You know the feeling: With a hopeful smile, you slide into a clubby, cheery gathering where revelers are grinning and regularly busting a gut, collectively riding the same giddy wave. You think you want in on the joke but then suddenly, desperately, you’re looking for the nearest exit. Crammed with funny performers — starting with Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph and Rachel Dratch — “Wine Country” looks like an easy, obvious win. Longtime friends, who decades earlier worked in the same pizzeria, travel to Napa, Calif., to celebrate a milestone birthday. Rebecca (Dratch) is about to turn 50, which has inspired the group celebration-retreat. Abby — Poehler, who also directed and helped come up with the story — is the event’s engineer and also the story’s real fulcrum. She hasn’t just hatched the itinerary, she’s also created dossiers for her friends filled with precision-timed commitments more suggestive of an armed invasion than a collegial reunion. The brisk opener is promising, with a series of quick introductions that sketch in each woman’s identity and suggest the hurdle each will soon confront. Rebecca is a therapist with an inattentive husband; Naomi (Rudolph) is the overextended mother with no visible help. Abby is packing up her desk at work while making the final arrangements, so seems to have complications. The other friends — played by Emily Spivey, Paula Pell and Ana Gasteyer — also have identities and issues, most tinny or vague. And, unsurprisingly, Tina Fey pops in every so often as the owner of the McVilla that Abby rents, a sprawl that comes with its own driver and (inept) cook (Jason Schwartzman). Once the friends convene, the movie settles into a lazy, lackadaisical groove. The episodic story — Spivey and Liz Cackowski wrote the script — tracks the women as they hang out, tour Napa, drink, laugh and cry. Repeat. The comedy is situational and confessional, the flat one-liners mixed in with more memorable physical comedy. The scripted lines rarely zing, sing or sting (some seem improvised), but when the performers fall down or screw up their faces, you get to watch them fill in their characters with something like real feeling, as when Naomi drunkenly invades a musical group and grabs the mic. You wouldn’t want to be in that bar or, really, anywhere these women assemble, but Rudolph is a treat. Poehler pads the drinking and sharing with pallid landscape shots that look like travel ads, though Napa has rarely appeared this washed-out. There’s some flirting and an unfunny bit about millennials. Mostly, Poehler focuses on the women in various formations. She also gives herself the best scene, snapping off her twinkle for a killer deadpan that becomes an unsettlingly unreadable blankness. Alas, in other scenes, some apparent and egregious digital manipulation occasionally turns the women’s faces into distracting smears. It’s a baffling choice given that one of this movie’s minor pleasures is that it assumes that a group of middle-age women are worth hanging out with, funny or not.

2019,‘Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation’ Review: A Return to 1969,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Michael Wadleigh’s epic, immersive, and still stirring 1970 documentary “Woodstock” remains the definitive account of the “Three Days of Peace, Love and Music” that went down in upstate New York in the summer of 1969. While that picture has a well-deserved rep as a fantastic concert film, it’s also a first-rate piece of contemporary reportage. “Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation,” directed by Barak Goodman, uses the perspective of nearly 50 years’ hindsight to demonstrate anew how the festival was both a mess and a miracle, and implicitly argues that it was a good deal more miracle than mess. The movie is all archival footage, no talking heads. Attendees both famous (David Crosby, for instance) and not contribute commentary and anecdotes off screen. The shots of the flower children flocking to the festival site are bracing. These young creatures that were once deemed “dirty hippies” look clean and cute and sweet. The heroes here include Max Yasgur, the dairy farmer who let the festival organizers use his land, which got pretty torn up. Then there’s the singer Richie Havens, who, having been practically cornered into opening the show, delivered a transcendent set. The cheerful anarchist Wavy Gravy and his mates from the Hog Farm commune provided solace to bum-trip victims, then fed the masses when concession food ran out. Finally, the residents of nearby White Lake chipped in, donating supplies from their own pantries when the going got tougher. “Kids are hungry, you gotta feed them,” one says. The “love thy neighbor” ethos behind that sentiment has been all but choked out of this country’s lingua franca. This movie will compel you to think about why that happened.

2019,"‘Wow, What Is That?’ Navy Pilots Report Unexplained Flying Objects","WASHINGTON — The strange objects, one of them like a spinning top moving against the wind, appeared almost daily from the summer of 2014 to March 2015, high in the skies over the East Coast. Navy pilots reported to their superiors that the objects had no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes, but that they could reach 30,000 feet and hypersonic speeds. “These things would be out there all day,” said Lt. Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot who has been with the Navy for 10 years, and who reported his sightings to the Pentagon and Congress. “Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we’d expect.” In late 2014, a Super Hornet pilot had a near collision with one of the objects, and an official mishap report was filed. Some of the incidents were videotaped, including one taken by a plane’s camera in early 2015 that shows an object zooming over the ocean waves as pilots question what they are watching. “Wow, what is that, man?” one exclaims. “Look at it fly!” No one in the Defense Department is saying that the objects were extraterrestrial, and experts emphasize that earthly explanations can generally be found for such incidents. Lieutenant Graves and four other Navy pilots, who said in interviews with The New York Times that they saw the objects in 2014 and 2015 in training maneuvers from Virginia to Florida off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, make no assertions of their provenance. But the objects have gotten the attention of the Navy, which earlier this year sent out new classified guidance for how to report what the military calls unexplained aerial phenomena, or unidentified flying objects. Joseph Gradisher, a Navy spokesman, said the new guidance was an update of instructions that went out to the fleet in 2015, after the Roosevelt incidents. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about the military, conflict and consequence.] “There were a number of different reports,” he said. Some cases could have been commercial drones, he said, but in other cases “we don’t know who’s doing this, we don’t have enough data to track this. So the intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace.” The sightings were reported to the Pentagon’s shadowy, little-known Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which analyzed the radar data, video footage and accounts provided by senior officers from the Roosevelt. Luis Elizondo, a military intelligence official who ran the program until he resigned in 2017, called the sightings “a striking series of incidents.” The program, which began in 2007 and was largely funded at the request of Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was the Senate majority leader at the time, was officially shut down in 2012 when the money dried up, according to the Pentagon. But the Navy recently said it currently investigates military reports of U.F.O.s, and Mr. Elizondo and other participants say the program — parts of it remain classified — has continued in other forms. The program has also studied video that shows a whitish oval object described as a giant Tic Tac, about the size of a commercial plane, encountered by two Navy fighter jets off the coast of San Diego in 2004. Leon Golub, a senior astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the possibility of an extraterrestrial cause “is so unlikely that it competes with many other low-probability but more mundane explanations.” He added that “there are so many other possibilities — bugs in the code for the imaging and display systems, atmospheric effects and reflections, neurological overload from multiple inputs during high-speed flight.” Lieutenant Graves still cannot explain what he saw. In the summer of 2014, he and Lt. Danny Accoin, another Super Hornet pilot, were part of a squadron, the VFA-11 “Red Rippers” out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Va., that was training for a deployment to the Persian Gulf. Lieutenants Graves and Accoin spoke on the record to The Times about the objects. Three other pilots in the squadron also spoke to The Times about the objects but declined to be named. Lieutenants Graves and Accoin, along with former American intelligence officials, appear in a six-part History Channel series, “Unidentified: Inside America’s U.F.O. Investigation,” to air beginning Friday. The Times conducted separate interviews with key participants. The pilots began noticing the objects after their 1980s-era radar was upgraded to a more advanced system. As one fighter jet after another got the new radar, pilots began picking up the objects, but ignoring what they thought were false radar tracks. “People have seen strange stuff in military aircraft for decades,” Lieutenant Graves said. “We’re doing this very complex mission, to go from 30,000 feet, diving down. It would be a pretty big deal to have something up there.” But he said the objects persisted, showing up at 30,000 feet, 20,000 feet, even sea level. They could accelerate, slow down and then hit hypersonic speeds. Lieutenant Accoin said he interacted twice with the objects. The first time, after picking up the object on his radar, he set his plane to merge with it, flying 1,000 feet below it. He said he should have been able to see it with his helmet camera, but could not, even though his radar told him it was there. A few days later, Lieutenant Accoin said a training missile on his jet locked on the object and his infrared camera picked it up as well. “I knew I had it, I knew it was not a false hit,” he said. But still, “I could not pick it up visually.” At this point the pilots said they speculated that the objects were part of some classified and extremely advanced drone program. But then pilots began seeing the objects. In late 2014, Lieutenant Graves said he was back at base in Virginia Beach when he encountered a squadron mate just back from a mission “with a look of shock on his face.” He said he was stunned to hear the pilot’s words. “I almost hit one of those things,” the pilot told Lieutenant Graves. The pilot and his wingman were flying in tandem about 100 feet apart over the Atlantic east of Virginia Beach when something flew between them, right past the cockpit. It looked to the pilot, Lieutenant Graves said, like a sphere encasing a cube. The incident so spooked the squadron that an aviation flight safety report was filed, Lieutenant Graves said. The near miss, he and other pilots interviewed said, angered the squadron, and convinced them that the objects were not part of a classified drone program. Government officials would know fighter pilots were training in the area, they reasoned, and would not send drones to get in the way. “It turned from a potentially classified drone program to a safety issue,” Lieutenant Graves said. “It was going to be a matter of time before someone had a midair” collision. What was strange, the pilots said, was that the video showed objects accelerating to hypersonic speed, making sudden stops and instantaneous turns — something beyond the physical limits of a human crew. “Speed doesn’t kill you,” Lieutenant Graves said. “Stopping does. Or acceleration.” Asked what they thought the objects were, the pilots refused to speculate. “We have helicopters that can hover,” Lieutenant Graves said. “We have aircraft that can fly at 30,000 feet and right at the surface.” But “combine all that in one vehicle of some type with no jet engine, no exhaust plume.” Lieutenant Accoin said only that “we’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths.” In March 2015 the Roosevelt left the coast of Florida and headed to the Persian Gulf as part of the American-led mission fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The same pilots who were interacting with the strange objects off the East Coast were soon doing bombing missions over Iraq and Syria. The incidents tapered off after they left the United States, the pilots said.",The New York Times
2019,‘XY Chelsea’ Review: A Whistleblower Out of Focus,"This hazy profile of Chelsea Manning features more glamour shots than psychological insights. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Frustratingly fuzzy and intermittently provocative, “XY Chelsea” profiles Chelsea Manning, the U.S. Army analyst who leaked cascades of classified documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. Picking up as Manning’s 35-year prison sentence is commuted by President Obama in 2017, Tim Travers Hawkins’s good-looking documentary features more glamour shots than psychological insights. Manning’s turbulent, remarkable story — including a troubled Oklahoma childhood with heavy-drinking parents, two suicide attempts and seven years in an all-male prison while transitioning to a woman — is a nonfiction filmmaker’s dream. Hawkins, however, seems content to hover on its surface, a decision that, depending on your viewpoint, feels either cowardly or humane. Certainly, when The New Yorker’s Larissa MacFarquhar interviews Manning (who’s currently back in jail for refusing to testify in the WikiLeaks inquiry) and tries to delve deeper, her subject appears visibly rattled. Refusing to fully interrogate Manning’s crime or her ethical choices, Hawkins simply observes her embrace of freedom in shots that favor impressionistic attention to her evolving physical appearance. (Outfit discussions might outnumber political ones, but they also usefully underscore that, for a trans person, presentation and politics are one and the same.) Later, as Manning suffers the treacheries of social media and embarks on a Senate run, the glimpses of steel in her wounded personality suggest the film’s focus on emotions over actions might be doing her, and her intellect, a disservice. “I’m not the person that people think I am,” she says near the beginning, but “XY Chelsea” (Manning’s Twitter handle) doesn’t enlighten us much. What’s left is a touching and tragic portrait of a vulnerable work in progress, one that for now might only be visible through a clouded lens. XY Chelsea Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes.

2019,‘Yomeddine’ Review: A Leprosy Survivor’s Journey Under the Desert Sun,"A.B. Shawky’s empathetic feature film follows a former leper through Egypt as he searches for the family who abandoned him. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The star and hero of the warm drama “Yomeddine,” Beshay, is a survivor of leprosy, who has lived in a leper colony in northern Egypt for most of his life. In the seclusion of the colony, he is married and makes his living picking up and selling trash from a local landfill. As played by the magnetic Rady Gamal, a cafeteria worker who was himself cured of leprosy, Beshay’s face and hands bear the scars of illness, but his pride remains intact. In one of the film’s first surrenders to narrative cliché, Beshay’s wife dies, leading him to venture outside the colony for the first time in his adult life. He hopes to find the family who abandoned him at the colony door. But in a nod to the film’s Arabic title, meaning “Judgment Day,” Beshay’s mission exposes him to scrutiny. “Yomeddine” is not a coming-of-age exactly — Beshay is no adolescent — but his search for a lost part of his identity mimics the patterns of the well-worn bildungsroman genre. And though leprosy may not be a common cinematic hook, the familiarity of the hero’s quest gives Beshay’s journey a lightness and predictability that seems at once welcoming and somewhat weightless. “Yomeddine” makes its strongest impression through the direction and performances; at times, the story is rather flimsy. In his first narrative feature film, the director A.B. Shawky demonstrates deftness with an inexperienced cast. He shoots with an eye for off-handed gestures, taking care to capture the light so that their skin — whether smooth or pockmarked — glows in the desert sun. But it’s the weathered Gamal who walks away with the movie, his insouciance and soulfulness immediately registering as beauty. Yomeddine Not rated. In Arabic, with English subtitles.

2019,‘You Can’t Always Be Exactly Who You Are’: A Chat With Maya Rupert,"The campaign manager for Julián Castro talked to The Times about the challenge of authenticity for candidates of color. Maya Rupert has a tough job: As campaign manager for Julián Castro, she is trying to help elect the first Latino president in United States history. But Ms. Rupert is hoping to make some history of her own, as well. She is just the third black woman to run a presidential campaign — Donna Brazile managed Al Gore’s campaign in 2000, and Maggie Williams managed part of Hillary Clinton’s 2008 run. Mr. Castro, the former housing secretary, is running far behind in public opinion polls and fund-raising. But he is campaigning steadily, and he recently met the donor and polling requirements for the first Democratic debate, likely securing him a spot and giving him a chance to broaden his reach with voters. Ms. Rupert previously worked at various groups dealing with economic, racial and social issues, but this is her first time working on a campaign. The transition to electoral politics has been a seamless one, she says, because she sees her new job as a continuation of her career-long fight for justice. Ms. Rupert recently spoke with The Times about how this election is different from past cycles and the role race will play, both as a policy issue and on the Democratic stage. This interview has been edited and condensed. Q. Is it strange to you that it’s 2019, and it’s still so rare to be a black woman running a presidential campaign? A. It’s real strange to me. I know so many amazing black women, like, we’ve got to get on this. But I also have a lot of hope that that’s changing. People are realizing how critical it is for campaigns and their leadership teams to reflect the communities that they are trying to resonate with. Secretary Castro always puts together diverse teams, so I know that his commitment is a genuine one. I’m sure that there are some people who are hiring from an optics perspective of having a diverse team this cycle. What people are going to see, though, is that in order to be successful, you need a diverse team. It’s so much more than just hiring a diverse pool because it’s the moment to do it. What challenges do people of color who run for office face that white candidates don’t? There are a couple of things. I think the American public metabolizes conversations about race being led by white people differently than they do when those same conversations are being led by people of color. I think there’s greater comfort, in some ways, hearing from a white candidate talking about how we need to confront white nationalism, and there’s discomfort when that same rhetoric comes from a candidate of color. We definitely grapple with how can Secretary Castro talk about race and racism in a way that is true to him and his experience, without being resisted in a way that white candidates just don’t have to deal with. The other is a little bit more subtle. Right now there’s a lot of conversation around this idea of authenticity. Well, the tough thing about being a person of color in this country, is that one of the first things you learn in order to succeed is that you can’t always be exactly who you are. We’re conditioned to a certain level of inauthenticity. And so, to suddenly be told that thing that made it so that you could succeed is now going to become a liability, is challenging. Secretary Castro tells the story about how people think he’s too squeaky clean, and he responds that he comes from a place where you don’t get second chances. We don’t get the opportunity to just fail up. If you messed up, that could be it. There’s a cruel irony to people of color growing up being told you have to be twice as good to get half as much. It’s so tied up in the way that we understand and perceive professionalism and whiteness as more closely aligned. How did you feel when you saw that Joe Biden released a campaign announcement video in Spanish? It’s a sign of the times. I think that people recognize that Latino voters will have a huge say in how this cycle plays out, and I think a move like that is a signal that this is a community that no one can take for granted. You can’t run for president and not speak to the Latinx community. Do you see that as someone stepping in your lane? Competing for your votes? From an electoral standpoint, it’s positive, it’s how we get a better policy. As far as a competition thing, I don’t see that as a single lane. There’s this weird dichotomy that we keep getting told, that you can either compete for folks of color or for white folks in the Midwest. I think that’s a false choice, and I think one of the most effective things Secretary Castro has done is point out that false choice. For example, everybody has an affordability crisis, and it manifests itself in a different ways. We don’t treat issues as taking them out of a bucket and addressing them. We really want to get at the root cause and talk about how all these things are related. You can’t talk about college affordability without talking about the achievement gap, or bettering teaching as a profession, or addressing the school-to-prison pipeline. You have to look at it more holistically. With this primary field being the most diverse in history, do you think a white man could win the Democratic nomination for president? I definitely think so. I’m always a little surprised at questions like that, because not only can he, history shows us that there’s a huge advantage. The idea that somehow being a white man has suddenly become a disadvantage is distracting from what the real project of representation is. The way white men who are running answer that question, though, will be very telling. Because I think that no one will be able to be successful without acknowledging — given a field this diverse, and given the changing demographics — if they are the right person at this time. I think we would be doing ourselves a disservice to think somehow being a white man has now become something that they’re going to have to overcome. Are you worried about building momentum for Mr. Castro? Honestly, no. Every day we talk to more people who are having the exact same reaction: They like these ideas, and they want to make sure that his ideas are the ones getting talked about. We just came back from She The People, which was the first-ever presidential forum specifically for women of color. Working for a candidate whose ideas resonate with this constituency, I was so thrilled because he got to air some of these ideas with folks who make up the backbone of the Democratic Party. I would rather have moments like that, where his message resonates with the women who are going to be the organizers for this election, who are going to be the people setting the tone, demanding answers and pushing things forward. I would rather see him be a top-tier candidate in a moment like that than anything else.",The New York Times
2019,"‘You Should Be in the Kitchen’: At Afghan Assembly, Women Are Told They Don’t Belong","KABUL, Afghanistan — On the second day of a traditional Afghan assembly this week, a delegate rose to speak on the topic at hand, peace in Afghanistan. A bearded man from Kandahar ordered her to shut up. “He told her: ‘Peace has nothing to do with you. Sit down! You should be in the kitchen cooking!’” recalled Behnoh Benod, 31, a male delegate who witnessed the put-down. The assembly, known as a loya jirga, was convened by President Ashraf Ghani to debate Afghanistan’s path to peace. Organizers proudly pointed out that 30 percent of the 3,200 delegates were women. But several female delegates said they felt ignored, marginalized or patronized. They were told that men should lead the jirga’s 51 committees and women should serve as secretaries. Some women complained that they were groped and fondled — not by men, but by women who patted them down during security checks. Other women said they had been confronted by male delegates who claimed to support women’s rights, but only under Shariah, or Islamic law — a view shared by the Taliban. “I asked them which Shariah law, the Taliban Shariah law or ISIS Shariah law,” said a delegate, Sakina Hussaini, referring to the Islamic State. “Some men didn’t accept women as human beings and I had to scream at them,” she said. Mr. Benod said just 16 of the delegates on his 108-member committee were women. A male delegate was selected as committee chair. Of the 51 committees, 13 were headed by women, and 28 elected women as committee secretaries. For many women, the jirga got off to a dismaying start when Mr. Ghani appointed as chairman Abdul Rab Rasoul Sayyaf, a combative former warlord known for his harsh views on women’s rights. Things quickly went downhill when a female delegate complained directly to Mr. Sayyaf and was hustled out by security guards. Other delegates hooted and clapped to drown out her protest. State-run television, RTA, which broadcast the proceedings, posted a banner on Twitter showing images of Mr. Ghani and Sher Mohammed Abas Stanekzai, the chief Taliban peace negotiator. Beside them were photos of two women with their faces covered — one by a niqab, a veil that leaves the eyes visible, and the other by a burqa, the all-encompassing garment forced upon women under the Taliban regime that was toppled in 2001. After a torrent of complaints on social media, a new banner appeared. Mr. Ghani and Mr. Stanekzai were still depicted, but four smiling women wearing head scarves that left their faces uncovered were added to the two with their faces concealed. And on Monday, as the jirga opened, some female delegates arrived dressed in burqas. “Most of these women have come from provinces and they have no idea why they are here,” said a delegate, Taiyaba Khavari. Ms. Khavari and other women said they grew disillusioned as they were insulted or interrupted by male delegates. Torpekai, 45, a delegate who goes by one name, said she had been pleased to be among war victims invited to Kabul. She said her 18-year-old son, a police officer, had been killed by the Taliban. Ms. Torpekai said she had planned to tell delegates that she wanted the Taliban punished if a peace deal gave them a role in a postwar government. But the men who dominated the jirga did not bother to listen. “No one would hear me out,” Ms. Torpekai said. “They said women shouldn’t be here — this isn’t a discussion for women.” It was not just women who felt disillusioned by the jirga. Social media lit up with arch commentary from Afghans who dismissed the assembly as a patronage tool for Mr. Ghani. Some critics said the jirga usurped Afghanistan’s Parliament. The government shut down the capital for five days, giving government workers the week off while other Afghans fumed over blocked roads and security sweeps. Taxi drivers complained that they were cut off from fares. Shopkeepers moaned that customers could not reach them. The jirga was caught up in a bruising presidential election campaign, in which Mr. Ghani is struggling to stay relevant while his government is excluded from peace talks in Doha, Qatar, between the Taliban and the United States. The militants refuse to meet with the government, calling it illegitimate. Many of Mr. Ghani’s political rivals boycotted the jirga, among them Abdullah Abdullah, the president’s partner in the unity government. Mr. Abdullah is running for president against Mr. Ghani. Rahmatullah Nabil, another presidential candidate who boycotted, called the jirga a waste of money and a campaign rally for Mr. Ghani. Jirga organizers said it was an effective exercise in grass-roots democracy that incorporated a wide range of Afghan society. Among the delegates were urban and rural residents, victims of war and terrorism, young people, traditional elders, and ulema, or Islamic religious scholars. Organizers said that with the government sidelined at the peace talks, the jirga produced a national consensus on conditions for peace with the Taliban. The assembly’s recommendations are not legally binding. “It’s our sacred tradition,” said Mohammed Umer Daudzai, who organized the gathering. “I doubt that anybody will say consensus-building or dialogue is a bad idea.” The jirga has a long and contentious history. After delegates to a secret jirga in the late 18th century conspired to replace the Afghan ruler, Zaman Shah, he had them all killed. In 1987, a gunfight erupted outside a jirga hall, killing or wounding 30 people. In 2002, some 200 female delegates attended a jirga that elected Hamid Karzai president. But many women had to jostle with male delegates for public microphones. Others said they had been threatened by government intelligence agents. At the close of the jirga on Friday, Mr. Ghani accepted its recommendation to seek a cease-fire, a goal of the Doha peace negotiations. He urged the Taliban to negotiate within Afghanistan and said he would release 175 Taliban prisoners. Among other recommendations accepted by Mr. Ghani was a demand that any postwar government honor the Afghan Constitution and protect the rights of women and children. He thanked the delegates, “especially the women.” One delegate, Wazhma Tukhi, 25, said she was satisfied. “The Constitution protects our rights, and that’s all Afghan women want,” she said. But another, Masuma Bahar, 24, said the jirga should have made a stronger case for preserving women’s gains over the past 18 years. “There were women on the board and they should have raised their voices, but they haven’t done anything,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,#MeToo Work at Art Basel Offers Cautionary Tale About Political Art,"Andrea Bowers removed part of her installation after complaints — but her piece raises questions about who can tell intimate stories. The Los Angeles artist Andrea Bowers made a monumental artwork that she hoped would support the #MeToo movement and presented it, with the help of four galleries, at the prestigious Art Basel fair in Switzerland. Three imposing walls of text and photos made up of 167 red panels retold the stories of men and women who had been accused of sexual misconduct or harassment since the movement began in 2017. But if the intent of her work, called “Open Secrets Part I & II, 2018, 2019,” was to raise awareness about insensitivity to women, it seemed to backfire when Helen Donahue, a woman who said she had been abused, complained on Twitter last week that photographs of her were used without her consent, and another woman, Abby Carney, said her name had been used without her consent. In a highly unusual move, Ms. Bowers extracted the panel in question, and issued an apology for having used the photographs. Ethics scholars said the incident at the fair, which closed Sunday, offered a case study in the complexity of creating political art. What rules apply for appropriating images and stories previously posted on personal social media accounts, or allegations made in a journalistic context? As socially conscious art has become increasingly popular, and these works enter galleries and other commercial settings, should moral lines be drawn? “This is a whole new set of questions,” said Prof. Griselda Pollock, director of the Center for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History at the University of Leeds in Britain. “Artists have a right to quote from the world, and they have authorization to present it as their art. But if you use materials that come from one context of use, with its own inherent ethics and politics, into another one, then we find that there are people who are challenging it.” Ann Demeester, director of the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands, who is an authority on ethics in contemporary art, said that Ms. Bowers’s work enters ambiguous territory because it makes artwork from personal images and material that was originally presented in a media context, without significant fictionalization or alteration. “I don’t know of any ethical written standards for artists, not even for curators,” she said, “but there’s a common understanding that you try to be as respectful as possible for any human person that you involved in an artwork. But sometimes when a work is activist, some people fall victim.” Protests erupted in 2017 at the Whitney Biennial when the artist Dana Schutz made a painting based partly on photographs of the mutilated body of Emmett Till, an African American teenager lynched in Mississippi in 1955. His mother had made the photos available to selected media after his death to illustrate the extreme brutality of his murder. Protesters objected to the fact that Ms. Schutz, a white artist, reused it for her own work. The legal aspect at stake is a principle called “fair use,” which typically applies when an original is transformed by being incorporated into art. The limits of fair use have been tested in lawsuits against Richard Prince, who has appropriated images posted on social media for his artworks and has sold them for millions of dollars. In this case, there is no lawsuit, but Robert Penchina, a partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr who specializes in copyright, trademark and media law, said that the fair-use principle could apply here. Including Ms. Donahue’s photo “in an artwork where the artist is putting it into context, combining it with 170-odd panels, is telling a particular story, transforming it by building upon it,” he said. “I think it is a good candidate for fair use, and potentially defensible on that ground.” The panel of the installation that contained the photograph was removed. Charles Krause, founding director of the Center for Contemporary Political Art in Washington, said, “This incident at Basel is probably a useful cautionary tale” for artists who make political art, and for “the gallery owners and fair promoters who are their editors.” “What about the accused?” he said in an email exchange. “How many of them have been found guilty in a court of law, as opposed to the court of public opinion and political expediency? Can we trust Andrea’s work is accurate with regard to them, or shouldn’t we concern ourselves about the actual facts of each individual case?” The panel of the installation that was removed concerned the freelance writer Michael Hafford and allegations made in 2017 by fellow journalists and former girlfriends in an article in Jezebel, an online magazine. Ms. Bowers, who declined to be interviewed for this piece, seems to have based her panel largely on that article, in which four women described physical or sexual mistreatment by Mr. Hafford. One of them, Ms. Donahue, told Jezebel he had caused her physical pain — and bruising — during intercourse that went beyond “rough sex.” Another, Abby Carney, said he had raped her in 2015. Ms. Carney wrote on Twitter, “TFW you find out someone turned your rape into “artwork” at Art Basel???” Neither woman has filed formal charges against Mr. Hafford. Mr. Hafford, reached by phone and email, did not respond to questions emailed to him by The New York Times. Neither would he comment on the allegations in Jezebel. In her artwork, Ms. Bowers incorporated photographs of Ms. Donahue’s bruised face, chest and shoulders that were originally posted on her Twitter account, and were also used in the Jezebel article; Ms. Carney’s full name was written into Ms. Bowers’ text. Ms. Donahue protested on Twitter that use of her image in the work was “exploiting us for ‘art’.” She added, addressing Ms. Bowers, “Do you know how [expletive] insane it is to find out my beat up face and body are on display as art rn for rich ppl to gawk at thru a stranger’s instagram story.” Ms. Bowers “absolutely realized that that was a mistake,” said Susanne Vielmetter, the owner and director of Vielmetter Los Angeles, one of the four galleries that collaborated to bring the artwork to the fair. “We all agreed it should be taken down,” she said. After they removed the offending panel from the installation, Ms. Bowers contacted Ms. Donahue, and explained the nature of her work and her intentions, Ms. Vielmetter said in an interview. The artist, in a public statement sent to The New York Times by her gallery and published on Twitter on Wednesday, said: “I, Andrea Bowers, would like to apologize to the survivor whose image was included in my piece,” adding “I should have asked for her consent.” Ms. Bowers is known for her drawings, videos and installations that focus on social issues ranging from workers’ rights to immigration to victims of harassment, including transgender women. Her artworks, in the collections of the Hammer Museum of Art, in Los Angeles, and the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, have reused text from protest posters and activist slogans. The galleries that brought “Open Secrets” to Art Basel, which also include Andrew Kreps, Kaufmann Repetto and Capitain Petzel, also issued an apology, adding “We stand by Andrea Bowers and her work and support the conversation that has only just begun.” In an interview, Ms. Carney said that she had never been contacted by the artist for any participation in the project and she had not received an apology from Ms. Bowers. “Part of the retraumatization is that it’s a half story or a poorly told version of the story,” she said in a telephone interview. “I’m trying to conclude that chapter, and to be known for my career successes and not for that.” The gallery owner, Ms. Vielmetter, in an interview at the fair, said that “this piece is showing how widespread this problem of abuse is, and how the cultural dialogue of what is and what isn’t acceptable sexual behavior is changing right now.” She added, “The last thing that we wanted to do was to do more harm to one of the survivors.” Ms. Vielmetter confirmed that the original asking price of the installation was $300,000 but added that the galleries who presented the art have now decided not to offer it for sale “out of respect for the ongoing conversation between Andrea Bowers and the survivor.” Ms. Carney said that she has mixed feelings about the fact that the single panel was removed, because she supports the idea of a discussion about this topic. “I believe she probably has good intentions,” Ms. Carney said of Ms. Bowers, “but when you’re telling someone else’s story, if you’re not careful, you can make it too general because you haven’t really taken the time to understand it.” She added, “My upset is not so much that I hate having my name out there, but more about getting a chance to talk about it. We are all writers and journalists, and we have powerful voices of our own.”",The New York Times

2019,$24.8 Million Raised in 24 Hours: Trump Adds to His Financial Advantage,"President Trump’s campaign announced Wednesday that he had raised $24.8 million over 24 hours as he kicked off his re-election bid, an enormous haul that punctuates the financial advantage he is expected to enjoy over his Democratic challengers in 2020. Mr. Trump’s one-day total was more than any Democratic presidential candidate raised in the entire first quarter of 2019, though it included money that went to joint fund-raising operations with the Republican National Committee. It came as he held a huge rally in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday night, telling throngs of cheering supporters that his new campaign slogan would be “Keep America Great.” Democratic strategists have fretted for months that Mr. Trump will spend 2019 building up a large war chest while the 23 Democrats running for president raise far smaller sums and then use that money to bludgeon one another in the primary campaign. Mr. Trump had already raised nearly $100 million for his re-election effort by the end of March, and had more than $40 million still on hand at that time. His campaign has spent millions of dollars on online advertising on platforms like Facebook and Google to find potential small donors, an investment that appeared to pay off handsomely on Tuesday. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] As an incumbent president, Mr. Trump also has the advantage of raising larger sums of money through his party. A spokesman for the R.N.C. said the $24.8 million figure was the total for the Trump campaign and its two joint fund-raising committees with the party, which can accept bigger checks. Republicans organized a day of phone calls to major donors on Tuesday to maximize their fund-raising haul. All told, $6 million was raised online, with an average contribution of $44; $8 million came from the phone-bank operation run jointly by the campaign and the R.N.C.; and $10.8 million came from larger donors to the R.N.C., a party official said. Mr. Trump also attended a fund-raiser on Wednesday at his resort in Doral, Fla., that was expected to raise about $4 million, according to a person briefed on the numbers. Mr. Trump filed papers with the Federal Election Commission for his re-election campaign on Jan. 20, 2017, the day he was inaugurated, but his team considered Tuesday the public kickoff of his 2020 bid. The single-day take of $24.8 million was nearly quadruple what former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. collected in the 24 hours after he officially declared himself a candidate, $6.3 million. Mr. Biden’s 24-hour total was the best of any Democrat in the race. In fact, Mr. Trump’s haul was more than Mr. Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders, former Representative Beto O’Rourke, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren raised in their first 24 hours as candidates — combined. Mr. Sanders raised the most money of any Democrat in the first quarter of this year, $18.2 million, followed by Ms. Harris ($12 million) and Mr. O’Rourke ($9.4 million). Mr. Biden, who entered the race in April, has not yet filed a quarterly fund-raising report but told donors this week that his campaign had raised nearly $20 million so far. Mr. Trump and his allies celebrated their fund-raising success on Twitter on Wednesday. “Crushing the competition,” wrote Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager.",The New York Times
2019,$4.6 Billion in Aid Advances to Help Cope With Migrant Surge at Border,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill on Wednesday to send $4.6 billion in additional aid to the southwestern border, as federal agencies there warn that they will run out of money to house and cope with the flow of Central American immigrants. The bipartisan agreement, which the committee advanced 30 to 1, allocates about $2.9 billion for the care of migrant children and $1.3 billion to improve facilities at the border. It does not allow the Department of Homeland Security to add beds at detention centers or migrant processing facilities. The agreement also includes oversight provisions sought by Democrats, including prohibiting the Office of Refugee Resettlement from sharing information with immigration officials about people who take custody of unaccompanied children. The restriction was designed to prevent the authorities from using the process of locating a family member or guardian of a migrant child as a backdoor means of finding undocumented immigrants. But the compromise was reached without input from House Democrats, who have been working on their own version, and it is unclear how the two measures align in addressing the administration’s urgent push for additional money at the border. “While House Democrats are still reviewing the Senate border supplemental legislation, my colleagues and I have concerns with the Senate bill as currently written,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. She said they hoped to bring a bill to the House floor next week. Concerns from House Democrats, particularly members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, about sending more money to agencies without stronger oversight, had led to the measure being pulled from an emergency relief package that passed the House last month. On Tuesday, House Democrats sent their Republican counterparts the text of their legislation, according to a congressional aide. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he planned a vote on the stand-alone measure next week, before members leave for their Fourth of July recess; House lawmakers have similar plans for their own measure. Having endured the nation’s longest government shutdown over funding President Trump’s border wall, lawmakers were careful to emphasize that the measure would primarily address humanitarian needs, including food, diapers and fundamental necessities for migrants in custody, and did not include money for the wall. The measure also allocates overtime pay for agents and officials at the border, as well as money for 30 new immigration judge teams to address a backlog of cases. “Our border security professionals and the children and families in their care cannot afford further delay,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, a Republican and the chairman of the committee, who asked his members to avoid adding amendments that would affect broader immigration policy. “I’m hopeful that a strong bipartisan vote will provide the momentum needed to assist our folks on the front lines.” Administration officials have warned Congress that without additional funding at the border, detainment centers and shelters for migrant children would continue to operate beyond capacity. The Office of Refugee Resettlement said this month that it would begin restricting or canceling legal aid, education and playground recreation for migrant children housed in government shelters as a result of financial constraints. Mark Morgan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told reporters this month that Congress had “failed” in supporting the efforts at the border. “I’m here as ICE begging for this,” Mr. Morgan said. “We need that to get the families out of the Border Patrol detention facilities and into better facilities.” The situation at the southwestern border — in May, more than 144,200 migrants were taken into custody there, the highest monthly total in 13 years — prompted most of the lawmakers to offer their support for the measure in committee. Five children have died in federal custody in recent months. As the chief architects of the compromise, Mr. Shelby and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the committee’s top Democrat, noted that both sides were forced to acquiesce on certain issues to reach the agreement. “Do I like every aspect of this bill?” Mr. Leahy said. “No.” But, he added, “we do not have the luxury of acting unilaterally on this committee or in the Senate.” Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia and chairwoman of the committee’s Homeland Security Subcommittee, told her colleagues that the measure “strikes a careful balance among competing views” and that spending bills for the next fiscal year would provide a chance to seek more funding for detention beds and expediting immigration proceedings. For Democrats, the oversight provisions, including preventing the money from being redirected toward construction of the border wall, requiring a monthly public report on the separation of families and money to accelerate processing of unaccompanied children, were enough to garner their support for the committee vote. It is unclear how that will translate to the Senate floor next week. Multiple senators, including Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, want clearer oversight language. If it is weakened, they could oppose the measure. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon and the lone no vote on the committee, said he still had a number of concerns about enforcement and facility conditions, including the failure to address for-profit centers housing migrant children. “America is better than this — the way we’re treating migrant children, migrant families waiting adjudication,” he said. But lawmakers were quick to emphasize that the package was a temporary solution for handling the surge in Central American families seeking asylum at the border, and that a long-term solution was needed to improve the nation’s immigration system. “All of us know perfectly well that immigration is a politically charged subject,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “But surely, at a minimum, Congress ought to at least be able to provide these emergency funds.” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he would postpone a markup scheduled this week to advance his own immigration legislation, which would radically overhaul asylum in the United States, making it far more difficult for some migrants to qualify and blocking many people from even seeking it. The measure would also do away with a court-ordered requirement that children be held for no more than 20 days in an immigration detention facility and alter a law that bars unaccompanied children from Central America from being quickly deported. Mr. Graham, who met Tuesday with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Mr. Durbin to explore a bipartisan compromise on asylum, said he had postponed action in his committee to provide more time to reach a deal. Mr. Durbin, who has been carrying around a sheet of yellow legal paper listing potential areas of consensus, has said he is open to such a compromise even though he and other Democrats consider most provisions of Mr. Graham’s bill unacceptable. He has proposed increasing the number of immigration judges available for asylum claims and providing aid to Central American countries conditioned on steps to deal with the root causes of migration. Mr. Durbin also wants to allow people to apply for asylum from their own countries, while Mr. Graham’s bill would essentially require that, blocking migrants who did not do so from seeking asylum in the United States. But without a more permanent solution, Mr. Graham warned on Wednesday as the humanitarian aid package was approved, “you better get ready to do this again, and again, and again.”",The New York Times

2019,10 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER at the David H. Koch Theater (June 12, 7:30 p.m.; June 13, 7 p.m.; through June 16). Unlike its monthlong winter season, Ailey’s spring season doesn’t even last a week, but the company packs a lot into it. Wednesday’s “Bold Visions” program includes a world premiere: “Ounce of Faith” by Darrell Grand Moultrie. Thursday’s gala features the Ailey calling card, “Revelations,” which is also on June 14’s “Trailblazers” program with Rennie Harris’s acclaimed two-act hip-hop ballet, “Lazarus.” The June 16 evening program pays homage to the beloved performer Carmen de Lavallade, who introduced Ailey to dance when they were both high school students in Los Angeles in the 1940s. 212-496-0600, davidhkochtheater.com AMERICAN BALLET THEATER at the Metropolitan Opera (through July 6). Performances of Cathy Marston’s recent retelling of Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” continue through Monday. Beginning Tuesday, they give way to the swashbuckling classic “Le Corsaire,” which had its premiere in the mid-19th century, making it a contemporary of Brontë’s tale. Instead of a demure Victorian romance, though, “Le Corsaire,” based on a Lord Byron poem, is a flashy, virtuosic fantasy about pirates, slaves and abducted maidens, complete with dated gender and cultural stereotypes that range from questionable to objectionable. But those leaps and spins! And that famous pas de deux! Audiences can be forgiving when the dancing is this fun. 212-362-6000, abt.org BALLET BRITISH COLUMBIA at BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (June 13-15, 7:30 p.m.). In 1990, a young Canadian dancer named Crystal Pite made her professional choreographic debut with this troupe, four years after its founding. Pite went on to become a highly praised dance maker, and Ballet BC has flourished in the past decade under the direction of Emily Molnar. Both women performed with Ballet Frankfurt under the direction of the revered American choreographer William Forsythe. In this visit to New York, all three share a program. The company will perform Forsythe’s sharp, shadowy “Enemy in the Figure,” Pite’s swirling “Solo Echo” and Molnar’s “To This Day,” set to the music of Jimi Hendrix. 718-636-4100, bam.org ‘BATTLE! HIP-HOP IN ARMOR’ (June 7, 5 p.m.) and ‘BATTLE OF THE LEGENDS: VOGUEING AT THE MET’ (June 11, 6:30 p.m.) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On Friday, the final round of hip-hop battles returns to the Met’s Arms and Armor gallery, where impressive young hip-hop dance artists, clad in chain mail, leather and metal inspired by the museum’s collection, do combat surrounded by age-old military gear. On Tuesday, in connection with the new exhibition “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” six dancers will partake in “Battle of the Legends,” a half-hour vogueing competition featuring prominent judges from the ballroom and fashion scenes, including Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue. Expect expert death drops, duckwalks and killer poses. 212-570-3949, metmuseum.org EIFMAN BALLET at New York City Center (June 7, 8 p.m.; June 8, 2 and 8 p.m.; June 9, 2 p.m.). The Broadway revival of “My Fair Lady,” soon ending its run, is a modern take on the Greek myth of the sculptor Pygmalion and his creation, Galatea. Now from St. Petersburg, Russia, comes “The Pygmalion Effect” by the choreographer Boris Eifman, known for his maximalist and often quirky stagings of well-known stories. In this telling, to the music of Johann Strauss Jr., the sculptor is instead a ballroom dancer who seeks to transform an awkward girl into a star. Ballet is the primary dance language, but in the ostentatious style and boisterous spirit of this production, “The Pygmalion Effect” could be a distant cousin of the Lerner and Loewe show uptown. 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] PILOBOLUS at the Joyce Theater (June 11-12, 7:30 p.m.; June 13-14, 8 p.m.; through June 29). It has been five years since the members of this animated, audience-pleasing troupe performed at the Joyce, but they’re making up for it with a three-week residency comprising two programs of dances made from 1971 to 2017. The most recent work is “Branches,” set to the sounds of nature and inspired by the woods of the Berkshires, where it was first performed. The oldest is 1971’s “Walklyndon,” a quartet that epitomizes the company’s founding philosophy of playful physicality. Both programs feature “Rushes,” a 2007 collaboration with the Israeli choreographer Inbal Pinto that allows Pilobolus to exhibit a rare melancholic poignancy. 212-242-0800, joyce.org SUNDAYS ON BROADWAY at Weis Acres (June 9, 6 p.m.). This intimate performance series, held in Cathy Weis’s downtown loft, concludes its spring season with a program curated by Weis and Emily Climer. Their guests include Jeremy Nelson and Luis Lara Malvacías, presenting the seventh in a series of improvised duets that explore time and aging, and Walter Dundervill and the video artist Iki Nakagawa, who have turned the process of creating a dance film into its own work. A programmatic gap in the fall was creatively filled by improvisational dances from a number of artists, and that fix was so successful it will be repeated as “Shorties,” described in press materials as “a flurry of micro-dances,” featuring 10 artists in one- to two-minute improvisations. cathyweis.org PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY at the Manhattan School of Music (June 7, 8 p.m.; June 8, 2 and 8 p.m.; June 9, 2 p.m.; June 11-12, 7 p.m.; through June 23). There was something about Bach that brought out the best in Paul Taylor. Whether he found in the composer a profound joy, as in the carefree classic “Esplanade,” set to a violin concerto, or romantic despair, as with “Promethean Fire,” danced to the organ blasts of “Toccata and Fugue,” Taylor seemed in direct communication with Bach. As part of its Bach Festival, and in memory of Taylor, the Orchestra of St. Luke’s presents a program of his Bach dances, as well as a world premiere by the very busy, much-admired choreographer Pam Tanowitz. 917-493-4428, msmnyc.edu/performances WOMEN/CREATE! A FESTIVAL OF DANCE at New York Live Arts (June 11-14, 7:30 p.m.; through June 16). The eighth edition of this festival features a collection of work that speaks to the many different interests of its participants: Karole Armitage is inspired by a 15th-century Noh play, while Jennifer Muller employs intense colors to set the scene. Jacqulyn Buglisi presents an ode to the environment; Carolyn Dorfman, in collaboration with Pilobolus’s Renée Jaworski, revisits vintage American pop culture; and Francesca Harper uses her own biography to explore the black body in mostly white spaces. Helen Simoneau and Katarzyna Skarpetowska also contribute dances. Different configurations of these works run on alternating programs. 212-691-6500, newyorklivearts.org",The New York Times
2019,10 Essential Nigerian Recipes,"What to Cook Good morning. We sailed a terrific print edition of The New York Times onto front steps and newsstand shelves this morning, with the Food section dominated by a beautiful essay and set of recipes by Yewande Komolafe that are meant to serve as an introduction to some of the essential dishes of Nigeria, the country in which Yewande was raised and still feels called by, after two decades in the United States. So here is fish pepper soup and jollof rice, beef suya and braised goat in obe ata (above), the Nigerian mother sauce of puréed red bell peppers, onions, tomato and habanero. Here, also, are Yewande’s recipes for efo riro, the stewed amaranth greens common to Yoruba kitchens across the Nigerian southwest, and for dodo, the fried sweet plantains that temper the heat of fiery main dishes. She tells the story of frejon, as well, a silky pudding of beans and coconut that is a dish of the port city of Lagos, a reflection of the cooking of those Africans repatriated there after the abolition of slavery in Brazil. And of crisp and starchy yam fries and Agege bread, dense and white. Of course there’s dessert, too: puff puff, a kind of Nigerian doughnut hole, nutmeg-spiked and tossed in spiced sugar. I hope — we all do here — that you will cook from Yewande’s words for years to come. There are many more recipes waiting for you on NYT Cooking. Creamy polenta with mushrooms, for instance. Slow-roasted salmon with citrus and an herb salad. Pasta with seared zucchini and ricotta salata. Yes, you need a subscription to access them. I hope, if you haven’t taken one out already, that you will buy one today.

Now, it doesn’t have anything to do with sauce pans or Mason jars, but gee willikers why’d it take me so long to catch up with the second season of “Fleabag” on Amazon? Maybe you’ve already binged it. Absolutely read Parul Sehgal on the subject of the show, then, and think long thoughts. ProPublica just unveiled its latest, an investigation into the 2016 capture of 10 Navy sailors by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It is of a piece with the rest of ProPublica’s Navy reporting, showing “inadequate training, poor leadership, and a disinclination to heed the warnings of its men and women about the true extent of its vulnerabilities.” In 2011, Barry Estabrook sounded the alarm in The Atlantic about the indentured servitude of farm workers in Immokalee, Fla., laboring in terrible conditions to bring Americans fresh tomatoes. Now Tobias Jones and Ayo Awokoya of The Guardian have performed a similar expose on the Italian tomato crop, farmed by migrant workers who are all but enslaved by the mafia that keeps the fields far from the rule of law. Finally, from The Times Magazine, here’s David Marchese’s interview with Trey Anastasio. And here’s Anastasio with Phish, “Johnny B. Goode,” Denver, Nov. 17, 1997.

2019,10 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice “No more pencils, no more books,” the song goes, and can we just say that we do not approve? Summer in this hemisphere officially arrives on June 21, but summer reading is upon us already, and more books are frankly just the thing. That’s why I’m following Parul Sehgal’s excellent advice and tearing through Kristen Arnett’s debut novel, “Mostly Dead Things” — it’s a gorgeous, funny story about love and grief and taxidermy — but if you’ve already read that, or are saving it for your two weeks at the lake house, then you might dip into the new sf collection from the great Ted Chiang, or read Jericho Brown’s latest book of poetry, or spend some time with Mira Jacob’s graphic memoir, “Good Talk.” Just read. We bring you Swedish thrillers and Jacobean mysteries and an alternate-reality jungle-infested 1920s Manhattan, assuming you like that kind of thing as much as we do. And if your summer plans involve armchair travel rather than the real thing, we offer one debut novel set in Alaska, another set in eastern Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, and a group biography of the characters who have taken up residence over the years on the isle of Capri. For the record, we like pencils too. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles MOSTLY DEAD THINGS, by Kristen Arnett. (Tin House Books, $24.95.) In this Florida-set debut novel, a young woman inherits her family’s taxidermy business after her father commits suicide. The book has plenty of room for wit alongside its earnest considerations of love and memory. “There’s none of the shyness and self-consciousness of so much American fiction that masks itself as austerity,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. Arnett “writes comic set pieces to make you laugh, sex scenes to turn you on. The action flips from the past to the present, swimming through first love and first grief on a slick of red Kool-Aid and vodka, suntan oil and fruity lip gloss, easy and unforced. This book is my song of the summer.” THE POISON BED, by Elizabeth Fremantle. (Pegasus Crime, $25.95.) A novel set in the court of James I that reopens the case of Robert and Frances Carr, aristocrats charged with killing a man who opposed their marriage. With skill and delicacy, Fremantle presents the period as a cabinet of curiosities; our reviewer, Sarah Perry, says that the novel makes “toothsome use of all this hurly-burly” to depict the Jacobean age with “the vivid, cleverly constructed and always faintly unreal quality of a stage set. … Throughout, the author’s eye for gleaming edges and the textures of flesh provides much to admire — objects and bodies in particular have a forceful and occasionally grotesque presence on the page.” BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT, by Malin Persson Giolito. Translated by Rachel Willson-Broyles. (Other Press, paper, $16.99.) In this absorbing Swedish legal thriller, a young attorney, reviewing the horrific case of a doctor convicted of molesting and stabbing a teenage girl, comes to believe the law was not entirely served. But was justice done anyway? “The author does not feel the imperative to explain too much or to tie her ending up in a neat bow,” Vanessa Friedman writes, reviewing the novel in her roundup of recent thrillers. “Instead, while by the end of the book the central question has been answered, even more have been posed — and not in the way that sets up a sequel (though that could happen), but in the way that imitates life, in all its messiness and obfuscation.” PAGAN LIGHT, by Jamie James. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.) Italy’s isle of Capri owes its cultural heritage to the famous and infamous outsiders who claimed it for their own, from the Emperor Tiberius to Oscar Wilde and Pablo Neruda. James’s “splendid history … presents a pageant of these decadent invaders and illustrious exiles,” Liesl Schillinger writes in her roundup of travel books for summer. “If you read James’s book, you will know that you should do more than sail through the narrow entrance of the Blue Grotto: You must hunt down the former Villa Behring, near Capri’s main square, where Gorky and Lenin played chess, and seek out the homes of the lesser-known figures of Capri’s past, whose rich stories are the true focus of this marvel of nuanced, connected biography.” EXHALATION, by Ted Chiang. (Knopf, $25.95.) Many of these nine deeply beautiful stories explore the material consequences of various kinds of time travel. Reading this book feels like being seated at dinner with a friend who will explain the state of the sciences to you without an ounce of condescension. “These stories are carefully curated into a conversation that comes full circle, after having traversed extraordinary terrain,” Amal El-Mohtar writes in her latest science fiction column. “It is as generous as it is marvelous, and I’m left feeling nothing so much as grateful for it.” GOOD TALK: A Memoir in Conversations, by Mira Jacob. (One World, $30.) Jacob’s graphic memoir is focused on what it means to be a person of color in America. Born in New Mexico to parents who immigrated from India, married to a white man and raising a biracial child in New York City, Jacob explores the tensions through talks with her relatives and others. “The medium is part of the magic of ‘Good Talk,’” Ed Park writes, reviewing the book for his graphic literature column. “The old comic-book alchemy of words and pictures opens up new possibilities of feeling. … The graphic elements (monochrome cutouts, photos) of ‘Good Talk’ seem to be a commentary on race. The people are black and white — except, of course, they’re not.” WESTSIDE, by W. M. Akers. (Harper Voyager, $22.99.) Akers’s lush, shimmering mystery is set in a Prohibition-era Manhattan that has been divided by a wall separating the affluent Eastside from the nightmarish Westside, which is teeming with jungle, rot and darkness. Our reviewer, Lyndsay Faye, calls it a “superb debut” that’s “steeped in existentialism while delivering gun molls, drunken wastrels and purebred thugs.” The private eye heroine, she adds, “attacks both trivial and impossible questions with endearingly clearheaded ferocity and good humor.” THE TRADITION, by Jericho Brown. (Copper Canyon, paper, $17.) Brown's poetry catalogs injuries past and present, personal and national, in a country where blackness is akin to illness. Even as he reckons seriously with our state of affairs, Brown demonstrates a spirit of semantic play. “In Brown’s poems, the body at risk — the infected body, the abused body, the black body, the body in eros — is most vulnerable to the cruelty of the world,” Maya Phillips writes in her review. “But even in their most searing moments, these poems are resilient out of necessity, faithful to their account of survival, when survival is the hardest task of all.” DISAPPEARING EARTH, by Julia Phillips. (Knopf, $26.95.) When two sisters are kidnapped on the remote Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Russia, it sends shock waves through the community. “The women who populate Phillips’s novel are so intrinsically and intelligently identified with their region that it’s impossible to understand or even consider them without Phillips’s precise evocation of Kamchatka,” our reviewer, Ivy Pochoda, writes. “She describes the region with a cartographer’s precision and an ethnographer’s clarity. … A tidy ending does not diminish Phillips’s deep examination of loss and longing, and it is a testament to the novel’s power that knowing what happened to the sisters remains very much beside the point.” THE UNPASSING, by Chia-Chia Lin. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) Addressing themes of cross-cultural mingling and immigrant assimilation, this captivating debut novel about a Taiwanese family in Alaska disarms with beautiful prose and intermittent moments of poetic idiosyncrasy. “What makes Lin’s novel such an important book is the extent to which it probes America’s mythmaking about itself, which can just as easily unmake as it can uplift,” Brian Haman writes in his review. An earlier version of this article misstated the period in which Elizabeth Fremantle’s novel “The Poison Bed” is set. It takes place in 1615, during the reign of King James I; it is not set during the reign of Henry VIII.",The New York Times

2019,10 Ways to Lower the Cancer Risk of Grilling,"If you plan to grill often experts suggest taking some small steps to make a big difference in lowering your exposure to compounds that are tied to cancer. Many people would be surprised to hear that grilling carries potential cancer risks. But each year, the American Institute for Cancer Research publishes guidance for “cancer-safe grilling,” cautioning consumers to avoid two types of compounds that have been tied to cancer. These compounds, called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines, get generated when food, especially meat, is cooked on a grill. They have not been proven to cause cancer in people, but lab studies have shown they alter DNA in a way that could lead to cancer. “Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are formed when any kind of organic matter,” primarily fat that drips off meat and down into the grill grates, “gets burned, because the carbon inside is being combusted in the flames, and those hydrocarbons get carried up in the smoke,” said Rashmi Sinha, senior investigator in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute. The resulting smoke can envelop the meat and coat it in the potentially carcinogenic compounds. The black char we’ve all seen on grill grates and grilled food? That’s the heterocyclic amines, or HCAs, which occur when high temperatures meet muscle meat, which includes red meat (pork, beef, lamb, goat), poultry (turkey, chicken) and fish. “Grilling — or even pan-frying — at these high temps causes amino acids found in the meat to react with another substance found in meat called creatine,” said Colleen Doyle, managing director of nutrition and physical activity at the American Cancer Society and a registered dietitian. Creatine is found only in muscle meat. “It’s the reaction of those amino acids and the creatine that form the HCAs, which is why we don’t see HCAs formed when grilling asparagus, squash, peppers and other vegetables.” As with most lifestyle choices related to dialing up or down one’s cancer risk, the dose makes the poison. Which means if you’re grilling once or twice a year, don’t sweat it. But if you plan to grill often — once or twice a week throughout the summer, say — experts suggest taking some small steps to make a big difference in lowering your exposure to these compounds. Grill fish, seafood, poultry or plant-based foods rather than red meat and especially processed meats like hot dogs; the World Health Organization considers processed meats a carcinogen and red meat a probable carcinogen. While HCAs are still formed while grilling fish and seafood, Ms. Doyle pointed out that you typically don’t have to cook seafood as long as beef and chicken, which reduces the accumulation of the compounds. Research suggests that marinating for at least 30 minutes can reduce the formation of HCAs on meat, poultry and fish. The reason for this is not entirely clear to researchers, but one possibility is a kind of shield effect. “If you put a barrier of basically sugar and oil between the meat and the heat, then that is what becomes seared instead of the meat,” said Nigel Brockton, vice president of research at the American Institute for Cancer Research. It also makes your meat more flavorful. Many kinds of fruits and vegetables are actually protective as far as cancer risk, and they don’t form HCAs when grilled. Several experts recommend using meat as a condiment. Think of alternating cubes of chicken with peppers and onions or peaches and pineapple on a skewer, for instance. This trick, which also works when pan frying, reduces the surface area of meat exposed to the hot surface, Dr. Brockton explained, since the meat is also touching other ingredients throughout the cooking process. According to Dr. Brockton, cooking your meat with herbs, spices, tea, chili peppers and the like — ingredients with phenolic compounds — can be a helpful approach because “it seems they quench the formation of the potentially carcinogenic compounds because of the antioxidant properties of those ingredients.” Try to minimize how much smoke you’re breathing in, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recommends as part of a helpful resource on healthy summer picnic practices. The black, crispy crust that you often see on the bony edges of ribs or steak is more likely to contain a higher concentration of potentially carcinogenic compounds. Ms. Doyle also recommends cleaning the grill grates ahead of time, to remove any previously generated char. “The longer you cook something, the longer the chemical reaction is happening, the higher the amount of HCAs are formed,” Dr. Brockton said. If you partially precook your meat, such as by baking or cooking in the microwave, the layer of HCAs that gets formed won’t be as thick. The same goes for meat cut into smaller pieces, such as with kabobs, because it cooks faster. Grilling in foil can also help protect the food from smoke and speed up the cooking time, according to the Harvard resource on healthy picnics. “Types of wood can influence HCA formation,” Ms. Doyle said. “Hardwoods, such as hickory and maple, and charcoal all burn at lower temperatures than soft woods, such as pine. Cooking with wood that burns at a lower temperature is desirable.” To minimize your exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, experts recommend selecting leaner cuts of meat or trimming any visible fat, which can lower the amount that drips down through the grates and comes back up in the smoke. To minimize dripping, Ms. Doyle suggests not piercing your meats while they’re on the grill. According to guidance from the National Cancer Institute, fewer HCAs are formed if you turn meat over frequently while cooking it on high heat.",The New York Times
2019,"100 Killed in Sudan and Dozens of Bodies Are Pulled From Nile, Opposition Says","Two days after a violent crackdown by Sudan’s security forces on pro-democracy protesters in the capital, a doctors’ organization that has helped organize protests reported that more than 100 people had been killed and hundreds more injured. The doctors’ group said on Wednesday afternoon that 40 bodies had been pulled from the Nile, reportedly by paramilitary groups, after the attack. Earlier on Wednesday, the doctors group said 101 people had been killed, including those recovered from the river, and 326 injured. If confirmed, the toll would make the attack the deadliest by security forces on the protesters since April, when the dictator who ruled Sudan for 30 years was toppled by his generals. In the aftermath of the raid, residents reported rapes and robberies at the hands of paramilitary forces, and said that internet and cellphone networks had been restricted or cut off. [Sudan ousted a brutal dictator. His successor was his enforcer.] After the coup, the generals of Sudan, Africa’s third-largest country, formed a Transitional Military Council to rule — to protesters’ dismay — and tense negotiations began. The protesters continued to demand a transition to civilian control. The generals resisted, but they continued to talk about potential compromises. Then, in early June, the talks collapsed and members of Sudan’s security forces fired on a major protest camp outside the military’s headquarters in the capital, Khartoum. Here is how Sudan, after three decades in the grip of one man, became caught in a crisis between civilian revolutionaries, hardened generals and a fractious network of paramilitary groups and militias. During his long reign, former President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, 75, outwitted rivals, survived civil wars and famine, presided over a decade-long oil boom and created a network of security forces and militias that some likened to a spider web. He also became a pariah in the West, accused of supporting terrorism — Sudan hosted Osama bin Laden in the 1990s — and orchestrating a genocidal purge in the Darfur region that killed hundreds of thousands of people. Since 2009, the International Criminal Court has tried to arrest him for Darfur atrocities, and Western countries have used sanctions and diplomacy to shun Sudan for decades. Oil revenue, which had grown Sudan’s middle classes, began to run dry. Mr. al-Bashir ended fuel and wheat subsidies last year, compounding slow-boiling frustrations over corruption and economic mismanagement, and protests against him erupted around the country. And though there were periodic clashes with the authorities, often with tear gas and sometimes with live bullets and confrontations between rival security forces, the protests continued for months. Reflecting the way that Sudan’s middle class has disintegrated in recent years, doctors and other professionals played a central role in organizing the protests, which set up a huge sit-in outside the military’s headquarters in the capital, Khartoum. The doctors helped transform what started as protests over bread prices into a coherent movement, calling for civilian rule. They also documented the fatal wounds of some protesters and established clinics to treat others for gunshot wounds, the effects of tear gas and other injuries. As the protesters held on, their prominence grew around the world. The image of a young Sudanese protester, Alaa Salah, went viral, as did stories of courage and romance among the demonstrations, which sometimes took on the character of a summer festival — itself rare in Sudan’s conservative society. The generation gap had consequences at the highest levels of power, too: The son of one of Sudan’s most powerful generals urged his father to help topple the president. On April 11, the military did just that, unseating Mr. al-Bashir, who was confined to a prison in the capital. The euphoria of protesters soured, however, as they realized that generals had taken over in a Transitional Military Council. The protesters decided to continue, circulating a taunt online: “It fell once, it can fall again!” Faced with the protesters’ outrage, the defense minister stepped down only days after taking power. (Another general replaced him.) Weeks of delicate negotiations followed, and amid the uneasy talks — with protesters signaling their approval and disapproval of various candidates put forward by the military — a carnival atmosphere took hold at the main protest site in Khartoum. Wary of the protest movement’s similarities to the Arab Spring uprisings that spread across the Middle East in 2011, powerful Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, stepped in to support Sudan’s military. (Under Mr. al-Bashir, Sudan had recruited young Darfuris to fight in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.) Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates pledged a $3 billion aid package, and Egypt — where the military ultimately took over after a revolution — provided diplomatic support for Sudan’s generals. On June 3, days after talks collapsed between the protesters and generals, Sudan’s security forces stormed a major protest camp in Khartoum. Dozens were killed and hundreds wounded, according to protest organizers. Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the military council’s head, announced that elections would be held within nine months. It remains unclear which parts of Sudan’s fractious military and security establishment were driving the crackdown. The United States Embassy in Khartoum blamed the Transitional Military Council led by General al-Burhan, but videos and eyewitness accounts pointed to the Rapid Support Forces, a powerful paramilitary unit drawn from the janjaweed militias that carried out atrocities in Darfur in the 2000s.",The New York Times
2019,11 Outdoor Installations to See in New York This Summer,"From the South Bronx to Governors Island and beyond, artworks are popping up all over the city. Here’s a guide to what’s happening. Across the city this summer, works that artists conceived for public spaces are turning up — like “Estructuras Monumentales,” five large-scale sculptures that Carmen Herrera started making in the 1960s that will be on view at City Hall Park from July 11 through Nov. 8. Other artists, like Leonardo Drew, have had to do more fine-tuning. Mr. Drew recently crossed over into public art with “City in the Grass,” an installation he designed (and redesigned) with Madison Square Park in mind. With summer officially here, there is even more art to come: At MoMA PS1, visitors will soon find a 40-by-90-foot panoramic “jungle” suspended over its courtyard, and in August, the photographer Elle Pérez will plaster images of diverse city communities on 100 city bus shelters. Here are 11 installations that demonstrate just what is possible when artists embrace the outdoors. Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn Sometimes the site of an artist’s work really amplifies the work itself. This is especially true of Tanda Francis’s “Adorn Me.” Fort Greene Park is the socioeconomic and racial dividing line of its neighborhood, with one side reflecting whiteness and affluence far more than the other. Ms. Francis installed her bust featuring three adjoining African faces where it would “speak directly to the African-American community, which often goes unrepresented in public art,” she wrote on her website. Impossible to miss at the corner of Myrtle Avenue and Washington Park, Ms. Francis’s piece is partially covered in African tribal markings, and its three sets of braids rise into a chandelier-like headdress. Through July 19. Court Square Park, Queens Marketing signs for newly-built apartment buildings are everywhere around Court Square Park in Long Island City, along with construction cranes and scaffolding, signaling that more units are on the way. Amid all this is Matt Keegan’s “what was & what is.” An off-site installation for the SculptureCenter, it consists of a rectangular glass box with one mirrored side. A horizontal scroll reads, “For a long time this neighborhood was about what will be, and now I think it’s about what is.” The quotation, from a developer, appeared in a 2017 New York Times article about the area’s “skyward” development, and exemplifies how real estate professionals sometimes see the city as being in service to new development. Through Aug. 18. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Manhattan This year, the Dutch sculptor Mark Manders has taken over the Public Art Fund’s inaugural outdoor exhibition site, Doris C. Freedman Plaza at the southeast edge of Central Park. Titled “Tilted Head,” his piece is just that: a large head resting on its side. Surface cracks and depressions suggest it is made of clay when, in fact, it’s cast bronze. “All my works look like somebody worked on it and just left,” Mr. Manders said in a video about his process. “Tilted Head” resembles a massive, abandoned model that people could consider a stand-in for the real thing. Through Sept. 1 at 60th Street and Fifth Avenue. High Line, Manhattan On the High Line, “En Plein Air” (the French phrase for “in the open air”) enlists eight artists to reconsider the tradition of outdoor painting. In “Five Conversations,” for example, the recent Turner Prize winner Lubaina Himid has painted portraits of fashionable black women on five reclaimed wooden doors — the old, paneled kind — adding subtle dimensions to each of them. Ms. Himid also integrated the doors’ accessories into her “canvases.” A round door knocker doubles as a hoop earring, a doorknob as a ring. Ms. Himid not only reimagines the process of “en plein air” painting, but also the subjects typically depicted within them. Through March 2020. High Line, Manhattan To get a look at Simone Leigh’s sculptural work, you could visit her exhibition, “Loophole of Retreat,” at the Guggenheim, or wander over to the Spur, the newest addition to the High Line. Although, to say that someone must be on the High Line to get a glimpse is a bit misleading. Traveling north on 10th Avenue toward 30th Street, you’d have to be daydreaming not to spot Ms. Leigh’s “Brick House,” a 16-foot bust of a black woman with cornrow braids and a torso resembling a type of African clay house. Created as the inaugural commission for the High Line Plinth, a focal point of the Spur, the work is distinguished by its imposing height. But if you mosey up to the Spur itself, you’ll notice the figure’s blotted-out eyes, which more effectively position her as someone to be seen, not simply looked at. Through Sept. 2020. Greenwich Village, Manhattan For Pride Month, the Public Art Fund has reinstalled a billboard that the conceptual artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres first presented at this exact location in 1989, nearly seven years before his death from complications related to AIDS. One of his “date pieces,” “Untitled” lists quintessential moments in the fight for gay rights in stark white print against a black background. Torres tried to create “an architectural sign of being, a monument for a community that has been ‘historically invisible,’” he once said. Through June 30 at Christopher Street and Sixth Avenue in Greenwich Village. Marcus Garvey Park, Manhattan For a commission organized by the Public Art Initiative of the Marcus Garvey Park Alliance, José Carlos Casado references black female subjectivity in “I Don’t Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Ah Me … ” The work, situated near Madison Avenue and 123rd Street in Harlem, contextualizes how Mr. Casado felt after reading Maya Angelou’s seminal memoir “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.” Working with archival-printed aluminum pieces, he made an amorphous, multicolored tower (one that becomes interactive with an augmented-reality app), and placed it within a 14-foot purple cage that, incidentally, wild birds use as a temporary perch. On the southern end of the park, Kim Dacres and Daniel A. Matthews have installed a black female bust, “Peaceful Perch,” near 120th Street and Fifth Avenue. Repurposing motorcycle tires, Ms. Dacres contorted this dark, textured material, contouring the figure from its folds and protrusions. Mr. Matthews helped fabricate the base, and situate it on the curved lawn above the park’s main path. Through Sept. 30. Governors Island Shantell Martin doesn’t have many rules for where her work goes. From the New York City Ballet’s home theater last winter to a Catholic Church on Governors Island this summer, Ms. Martin’s drawings have decorated some unusual places. Her line drawings feature cartoonlike faces and stick figures, almost always in black ink on a white background. “Church,” the mural Ms. Martin drew on Our Lady of the Sea, a deconsecrated church built in 1942, encourages viewers to re-engage with this disused building. Through Oct. 31. Riverside Park South, Manhattan Sarah E. Brook wants people to feel a little disoriented when they’re looking at “Viewfinding,” her sculpture installation in Riverside Park South. Ms. Brook positioned five tall wooden structures in a row, each containing thin, brightly-colored panels that reflect the light — most dramatically at sunrise and sunset. For the piece, Ms. Brook had an open call for queer-identified poets. Her final selections — 26 in all — are engraved on acrylic plates that have been neatly placed on a bench at the structure’s base. The engravings are meant to amplify queer voices and, paired with the vertical installation, explore “how vastness can dismantle limiting narratives of being,” she wrote on her website. (On Saturday, June 22, the artist will host a multidisciplinary queer arts festival called Alternative Pride at “Viewfinding.”) Through Aug. 22 at 67th Street. South Bronx The plot at the corner of Intervale Avenue and Kelly Street in the South Bronx has been many things over the years. In 1982, when John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres scaled its adjacent wall to mount “Banana Kelly Double Dutch” — molds of four local girls in a tableau of the game — it was a small park. Mr. Ahearn and Mr. Torres have restored and reinstalled the work twice in the intervening years, first in 1986 and then in 2017, when Mr. Ahearn and Mr. Torres saw an opportunity to freshen it up after hearing the site was set for redevelopment. Last summer the girls, glistening like new, were returned to their original home — which now overlooks the parking lot of a nursing home. Open indefinitely. An earlier version of this article misstated the closing date of Matt Keegan’s installation in Long Island City, Queens. The work, “what was & what is,” will be on view through Aug. 18, not Aug. 19. An earlier version of this article, because of an editing error, incorrectly described the artist Mark Manders as being among the artists whose works are included in the Frieze Sculpture installation at Rockefeller Plaza. Mr. Manders only has an outdoor sculpture at Doris C. Freedman Plaza in Manhattan, not at Rockefeller Plaza.",The New York Times

2019,"Opinion | 11,000 Americans Will Die Waiting for Transplants This Year","This article has been updated to reflect news developments. In the video Op-Ed above, people on the organ wait list argue that it’s time for the government to step in, provide oversight and require transparency in the organ recovery system. Research shows that organ procurement organizations, responsible for recovering organs, are inefficient and lack accountability. While a record number of organs have been transplanted in the past five years, that is not evidence of a well-working system: These numbers are bloated by a recent increase in opioid-related deaths. On Wednesday, President Trump signed an executive order that seeks to improve how this county’s handles organ transplants. It instructs the Health and Human Services Department to create transparent and enforceable metrics for organ procurement organizations. (Currently, these organizations are able to self-report data, which has led to an over-reporting of organ recovery rates.) Health and Human Services has 90 days to to determine exactly what kind of change to make. To add your support for standardized metrics for organ procurement organizations, sign this petition.

2019,"11,000 People Who Prepare Your Airline Food Are Considering a Strike","President Trump announced a deal to end the government shutdown in January after a shortage of air traffic controllers briefly stopped flights into La Guardia Airport. At the time, many concluded that workers’ impact on travel had led the White House to retreat. “I think it’s really obvious to all aviation workers that that’s what happened,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. “There are also many people in government who echo” that analysis. Now, other airport workers are testing that proposition. This month, about 11,000 airline catering employees — the people who prepare and transport food and beverages that millions of passengers consume on flights each year — will vote on a first step toward a possible labor stoppage. Many make the minimum wage in their areas, or less, and toil in harsh conditions with limited benefits. But collectively, they have the power to disrupt the air travel network. “The smallest mishap or interruption in any kind of service ripples out,” said Liesl Orenic, a labor historian at Dominican University in Illinois who has studied airport workers. “If a plane doesn’t get catered, it can interrupt all the people getting on that plane and all the other flights that plane has to do.” For decades, as unionization rates have fallen and the country has moved to a service economy, organized labor has found that it has less power to affect employers’ bottom lines. Even successful labor actions in the last few years — like the Fight for $15 campaign, which has helped raise wages in fast food and other industries — have tended to bring political pressure through sophisticated public-relations tactics rather than attempts to directly inflict economic losses. But the muscle-flexing by airport workers may reflect the return of a model in which aggrieved employees threaten the wheels of commerce. During the government shutdown, an increase in the number of air traffic controllers calling in sick prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to halt flights headed for La Guardia. (Their union said that the delays had resulted from the absence of a small number of controllers acting individually amid the strains of the shutdown and that it would oppose a coordinated sickout.) More recently, mechanics at Southwest Airlines won raises after a large increase in the number of maintenance issues they flagged forced flight delays and cancellations. D. Taylor, president of the hospitality-industry union Unite Here, which represents a majority of airline catering workers, did not rule out the possibility that his members’ actions could have similar effects. “We’ll do whatever it takes, within legal means, to make sure workers get good contracts,” Mr. Taylor said. The workers are primarily employees of two large catering companies, LSG Sky Chefs and Gate Gourmet, although United Airlines employs some directly. As a group, they are among the lowest-paid workers at airports, especially among those whose labor directly affects operations on flights. The union is proposing a national wage floor of $15 per hour for all catering workers and wants the companies to make their health insurance substantially more affordable. Preston Strickland, who works at the Sky Chefs kitchen serving Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, said he typically prepares over 1,500 cold entrees in a shift, which he spends in an area kept at 40 degrees or below. Mr. Strickland makes a little over $11 per hour after more than four years on the job and cannot afford health insurance on his company’s plan, he said. “I prefer to pay my phone bill, car insurance,” he said. “If I get sick, I go to the emergency room.” He recently spent several months homeless because he didn’t have money for rent. A Sky Chefs spokesman said the union had agreed to workers’ pay rates in previous rounds of negotiation, the most recent of which began in 2015. The union also agreed to allow those pay rates to supersede state or local wage laws. Workers also complain about the companies’ tendency to run kitchens with too few workers, too little equipment and haphazard upkeep. Juan Blanco, a driver with Sky Chefs at a kitchen serving Kennedy International Airport in New York, said a door on his truck had a broken spring and fell on his head in 2017, leaving him with a concussion and a shoulder injury requiring surgery. He was out of work for weeks and relied on workers’ compensation payments to cover his hospital bills. The Food and Drug Administration has validated some of these concerns, citing the catering companies for numerous food-safety infractions over the years. In March 2018, the agency sent Gate Gourmet a warning letter regarding its workplace near Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, where inspectors observed “dead apparent nymph and adult cockroaches too numerous to count” in areas where food was cooked, as well as “a heavy buildup of more than a day’s accumulation of grease, food deposits and general filth.” The agency said in a follow-up letter two months later that the company had addressed its concerns. A Gate Gourmet spokeswoman said the company had worked closely with the F.D.A. to correct the issues. Unlike most private-sector workers, caterers and other airline workers are covered by the Railway Labor Act, whose purpose is to avoid chaos in the rail and airline industries because of their importance to interstate commerce. That means workers don’t have the right to strike without permission — officially a “release” from mediation — from a federal agency known as the National Mediation Board, which rarely grants it. But as recent events have demonstrated, there is a wide gulf between labor harmony and a formal strike, and workers have ample opportunity within that range to affect air travel. During the stalemate at Southwest, the company accused its mechanics of effectively grounding planes over minor glitches, such as missing row numbers. The union denied these allegations. Some workers in airline-related jobs have long been leery of taking an aggressive approach to labor issues. Air traffic controllers were traumatized for decades by the mass firing of controllers at the hands of the Reagan administration over an illegal strike in 1981. Until this year, they tended to avoid any significant action that could be construed as coordinated. Some economically vulnerable workers have been less assertive as well, but experts say catering workers have underappreciated leverage. According to Robert W. Mann, a longtime airline industry consultant, there is far less margin for error built into the air travel system compared with two or three decades ago. If a flight is supposed to arrive at Gate G17, Mr. Mann posited, “and half an hour before departure it flips over to Gate A24, the logistics of getting that catering to arrive at the now distant Gate A24 in time to do everything else in the sequence you have to do it is quite daunting.” A team of less than fully motivated workers could throw the whole process off. In principle, the airlines could scale back in-flight food and beverage service. But they would risk a backlash from passengers, one that might be amplified by other airport workers. “We will also take part in helping to inform the public more generally about what disruption this would have in our ability to provide service,” said Ms. Nelson, the flight attendants’ leader. The confrontation looms as labor disruptions appear to be rising, albeit in vastly different contexts. New England workers at the grocery chain Stop & Shop won wage increases and preserved health care benefits that the company had threatened after more than 30,000 of them staged an 11-day strike in April that cost the company an estimated $100 million. That followed last year’s teacher walkouts, which shut down schools in several states for days. Over all, the number of workers who took part in strikes involving more than 1,000 workers last year reached its highest level since the mid-1980s; the number of days lost to such strikes was the highest in 15 years. The National Mediation Board, where Republicans hold a majority, appears to appreciate the high stakes for management and labor that may be converging at airports. This year, the board proposed a rule that would make it easier to eliminate airport and railway unions. Although the rule had long been in the works, according to the agency, the timing of its release struck union leaders as intriguing: It came less than one week after the government shutdown ended.",The New York Times
2019,11-Year-Old Bystander Is Wounded in Brooklyn Street Shooting,"The boy was passing by a group of men in Crown Heights when the gunman approached and started shooting just after 7 p.m., according to the police. An 11-year-old boy was shot and wounded on Thursday when a gunman opened fire on a street in Brooklyn, the police said. The boy was passing by a group of men gathered in front of 243 Schenectady Avenue in Crown Heights when the gunman approached the group and started shooting from less than 50 feet away just after 7 p.m., according to the police. The boy was shot in the chest below his right shoulder and rushed to Kings County Hospital Center in critical condition, the police said. His condition improved after he underwent surgery and he was expected to survive, the authorities said. A 31-year-old man who was shot in the left knee transported himself to Kings County Hospital Center and was in stable condition, the police said. The boy was taken to the hospital by a passing ambulance that was already carrying another patient. The police said the man and the child were not related, and neither was the intended target. On Friday afternoon, the police arrested Angel Eaddy, 27, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and charged him with the shooting. A motive was not immediately clear. Mr. Eaddy had a prior arrest on an assault charge in 2016. Mr. Eaddy lived in a two-story rowhouse on Park Place, only three blocks from the shooting, according to the police. A neighbor, Eric Thompson, 41, said Mr. Eaddy appeared to be “a good guy” who was friendly with his neighbors and had a job with FedEx. Geo Primus, who works at the Food Universe grocery store at 243 Schenectady Avenue, said the store’s surveillance cameras captured the shooting. He said the footage showed a man, wearing a white T-shirt, red shorts and basketball sneakers crossing the street and stopping in front of the supermarket. Mr. Primus said the man pulled out a gun and fired about six shots at passers-by near Lincoln Place. “It was very reckless,” Mr. Primus said in a phone interview. “Who knows how many people could have been hurt? It was literally just bystanders.” Kyle Shermer, 25, said he had walked out of his apartment on Schenectady Avenue to take out trash when he heard four shots “in rapid succession” from the direction of the grocery store across the street. “I saw a person running away from the scene,” he said. “I don’t know if it was the shooter or not.” Anna Shermer, 21, Mr. Shermer’s wife, said she, too, heard shots and ran outside, where she saw a shirtless boy lying motionless on the ground. He was surrounded by a group of anguished adults including a woman who cried out, “He shot my son,” Ms. Shermer said. “They were screaming: ‘Who would do this to a child? Why would you shoot him?’” she said. Her husband said the shooting was a shock. “I’ve been living in this area a year, year and a half, and I always hear gunshots from two or three blocks away,” Mr. Shermer said. “But not this close.” Deputy Chief Michael Kemper, who oversees detectives in a swath of precincts collectively called Brooklyn North, and Assistant Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, commander of the Brooklyn North patrol borough, urged people to continue to come forward with tips. “We can’t let incidents like this go unchecked,” Chief Maddrey said. “We can’t let shooters believe that they can do this with impunity.” The two people injured in the shooting were among more than 360 people in the city who have been injured by gunfire this year as increases in shootings in parts of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens have offset an overall decline in gun violence across the city, according to the most recent police data. As of June 16, the city had had 20 more shootings than over the same period last year, including 16 additional shootings over the four-week period that ended Sunday. Many victims are not the intended targets. So far this month, at least seven other bystanders have been struck by gunfire, according to CBS New York.",The New York Times
2019,12 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice From Sarajevo to New York to Damascus to San Francisco, cities are prominent among this week’s recommended titles: their architecture, their landmarks, their roiling energy and occasional descents into chaos or lawlessness. The real estate journalist Julie Satow delivers a portrait of New York’s iconic Plaza Hotel, once owned by Donald Trump and forever ruled by the fictional Eloise. In twin memoirs, the novelist Aleksandar Hemon (now a Chicagoan) looks back on his childhood in 1970s Sarajevo, before that city was irrevocably altered by war. In “The White Devil’s Daughters,” Julia Flynn Siler offers a history of San Francisco’s Chinatown and the heroic struggle to banish sexual slavery there. And in “Assad or We Burn the Country,” the foreign correspondent Sam Dagher writes about his time in Damascus and the damage the Assad regime has unleashed on Syria. We also suggest a couple of newly translated novels by the Italian writer Natalia Ginzburg, along with a surreal story collection by Karen Russell and comic novels by Leah Hager Cohen (about a wedding in upstate New York) and Randy Boyagoda (about a college professor turned suicide bomber). Fans of Kate Atkinson’s crime novels probably know that she has a new Jackson Brodie mystery out, but the rest of you should check it out too. Finally, Nigel Hamilton completes his trilogy of biographies about Franklin Roosevelt as a wartime president, and Douglas Brinkley retraces the path to Apollo 11 just in time for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles THE DRY HEART, by Natalia Ginzburg. Translated by Frances Frenaye. (New Directions, paper, $12.95.) HAPPINESS, AS SUCH, by Natalia Ginzburg. Translated by Minna Zallman Proctor. (New Directions, paper, $15.95.) Ginzburg died in 1991, celebrated as one of the great Italian writers. Her work is making its way again into the Anglophone world — encouraged, perhaps, by the popularity of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels, which have something in common with the uncompromising feminism and radical politics of these slender novels. (In “The Dry Heart,” the narrator shoots her husband between the eyes; in “Happiness, as Such,” a firebrand son flees to England.) “Where does style come from? Is it knowingly constructed or unconsciously secreted? Invented or inherited?” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “These questions dog me whenever I read Ginzburg, whose thumbprint is so unmistakable, so inscribed by her time, yet whose work stands so solidly that it requires no background information to appreciate.” MY PARENTS: AN INTRODUCTION/THIS DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU, by Aleksandar Hemon. (MCD, $28.) In this two-in-one autobiographical volume — the book has two front covers, and its halves have been placed back-to-back rather than sequentially — the Bosnian-born Hemon writes about his parents and his own youth in 1970s Sarajevo. His parents eventually emigrated to Canada, while Hemon settled in Chicago. “Like Hemon’s fiction, the real-life stories in ‘My Parents’ are so exquisitely constructed that their scaffolding is invisible,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “You get the sense that he is trying to understand his parents in a way that his younger self did not.” AMERICAN MOONSHOT: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race, by Douglas Brinkley. (Harper/HarperCollins, $35.) In his study of the politics behind Apollo 11’s launch, Brinkley fits the space program into a wider American social context. He also asks whether the program was worth the tens of billions it cost, and argues that for its technological advances alone, it was. Our reviewer, the historian Jill Lepore, evaluates the book alongside a stack of other titles being published to coincide with the moon landing’s 50th anniversary, and calls it “the best new study of the American mission to space, rich in research and revelation.” ORIGINAL PRIN, by Randy Boyagoda. (John Metcalf/Biblioasis, paper, $14.95.) This highly original novel traces an unexceptional professor’s path to becoming a suicide bomber. The comedy of literary and cultural references involves serious matters like cancer, a crisis of faith and Islamic terrorism, as well as easier comic subjects like juice-box fatherhood and academia. “Boyagoda finds dark absurdities in all corners,” Tom Barbash writes in his review. “Without revealing how suicide bombing figures into the final act of the book, it’s enough to say that it fits into Boyagoda’s absurdist design and raises … some of the book’s most fascinating questions about fanaticism and the state of the modern world.” BIG SKY, by Kate Atkinson. (Little, Brown, $28.) After a nine-year absence, Atkinson’s laconic private eye, Jackson Brodie, returns to deliver his idiosyncratic brand of justice in a case involving human trafficking. Marilyn Stasio, reviewing the book in her latest crime column, says that “Atkinson is writing about major crimes and strong themes here, but it’s the voices of her characters that make you clutch your heart: people like Crystal, an abused woman who prefers ‘quiet men with low opinions of themselves,’ and Bunny, a drag queen dreaming of a triumphant stage appearance.” THE PLAZA: The Secret Life of America’s Most Famous Hotel, by Julie Satow. (Twelve, $29.) Satow’s gossip-stuffed tale traces the history of one of New York’s most iconic landmarks, the imposing white chateau at the corner of 59th and Fifth. “A great hotel is a theater of dreams,” Tina Brown writes in her review, “and Julie Satow, a journalist who covers New York real estate, digs deep into the forces that took the Plaza from a living center of aspiring social connection tied to the fortunes of American high society to its present status in an atomized era of pitiless transactional globalism.” THE WHITE DEVIL’S DAUGHTERS: The Women Who Fought Slavery in San Francisco’s Chinatown, by Julia Flynn Siler. (Knopf, $28.95.) From the Gold Rush to the 1930s, a sex slave trade flourished in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Siler’s colorful history includes portraits of the determined women who helped thousands of Chinese girls escape to freedom. “She focuses commendable attention on exemplary but overlooked figures,” our reviewer, Gary Kamiya, writes, and “also spotlights several men who played an important role in the struggle for civil rights and equal opportunities for Chinese and Chinese-Americans.” ORANGE WORLD: And Other Stories, by Karen Russell. (Knopf, $25.95.) Florida is the original or adopted home of some of America’s most inventive fiction writers, Russell prominent among them. Her new collection is a feat of literary alchemy, channeling her home state’s weirdness into unexpectedly affecting fantastical scenarios and landscapes. Reviewing it, Emily St. John Mandel takes note of “Russell’s abiding interest in the surreal and the strange”: “Striking a balance between realism and artifice is a difficult task for any fiction writer,” Mandel writes, but “in ‘Orange World’ the strangeness is never forced, the surrealism always grounded in recognizable emotion and experience.” STRANGERS AND COUSINS, by Leah Hager Cohen. (Riverhead, $27.) Cheerful and lively, Cohen’s new novel — set at an anarchic family gathering in rural New York — packs a lot of themes into its satisfyingly simple frame. As in a Shakespearean comedy, disparate relationships are resolved and familial love prevails. Cohen aims “to highlight issues of loss and family secrets, as well as the pleasures and dangers of pageantry,” Sylvia Brownrigg writes in her review. “The novel’s ultimate plea,” she adds, is “for acceptance, of others and of ourselves.” WAR AND PEACE: FDR’s Final Odyssey, D-Day to Yalta, 1943-1945, by Nigel Hamilton. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $30.) The final volume in the “F.D.R. at War” trilogy presents a heroic Roosevelt fending off myopic advisers to lead the Allies to victory. Peter Baker, reviewing it, says the book is “as gripping and powerfully argued as the first two” in the trilogy; he adds that the Roosevelt in these pages is “an all-knowing demigod, at once judicious and cunning, so visionary that he devoted much of his energy in the final chapters of the war to what would follow. … Hamilton argues, fairly enough, that no one did more to create a global structure that might forestall a third world war.” ASSAD OR WE BURN THE COUNTRY: How One Family’s Lust for Power Destroyed Syria, by Sam Dagher. (Little, Brown, $29.) Dagher draws on history, interviews and his own experience as a reporter in Syria to depict an utterly ruthless regime. The author is “open about his detestation of the Assad family and all their works, which he observed at close hand for two years,” Patrick Cockburn writes in his review. “He was briefly held by pro-regime militiamen in an underground prison and was summarily expelled by the Mukhabarat in 2014. This gives his description of events a credibility lacking in many other accounts.”",The New York Times

[ Read our review. ] In a love- and booze-filled romp through 1940s New York, this new novel from the author of “Eat, Pray, Love” features a rebellious ingénue and a demimonde of hard-living showgirls and theater people.

2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. THE ROBERT CRAY BAND AND MARC COHN at St. George Theater (June 14, 8 p.m.). More than four decades after initially forming the band that bears his name, Cray, a much-lauded guitarist, is still playing the blues. At this Staten Island theater, he will appear with Cohn, the singer-songwriter best known for his 1991 hit “Walking in Memphis.” Recently, Cohn has been collaborating with the Blind Boys of Alabama, the gospel outfit whose sole surviving original member, Jimmy Carter, helped found the group in the 1940s. The Blind Boys are also on the bill; expect them to sing selections from “Work to Do,” the collaborative album they will release with Cohn in August. 718-442-2900, stgeorgetheatre.com DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE at Forest Hills Stadium (June 15, 6 p.m.). Ben Gibbard, the frontman of this group, has one of the most distinctive voices in indie rock — though he’s quick to point out that, having been signed to a major label for over a decade, the group is hardly “indie” anymore. His wistful tenor matches the earnestness of his lyrics, which, for the more than 20 years that he has led Death Cab, have captured the uncertainty of youth and the agony and ecstasy of love on songs like “Soul Meets Body.” At this stadium in Queens, his band will be joined by Jenny Lewis, the former Rilo Kiley singer whose recent album, “On the Line,” considers family, illness and addiction. foresthillsstadium.com BILLIE EILISH at Radio City Music Hall (June 19, 7:30 p.m.). This singer from Los Angeles is a truly contemporary pop star. The 17-year-old broke out with a single track, “Ocean Eyes,” uploaded to SoundCloud in 2015; its success segued into a record deal, a modeling contract and massive internet celebrity. In March, Eilish released her debut album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” It’s full of dark, off-kilter tracks like “Bury a Friend,” a song written from the perspective of the monster under her bed. Eilish’s performance at Radio City comes the day after a sold-out appearance at Pier 17; resale tickets are available for both shows. 212-465-6000, radiocity.com FATHER JOHN MISTY AND JASON ISBELL AND THE 400 UNIT at the Prospect Park Bandshell (June 19, 6:30 p.m.). Performing back-to-back at this BRIC benefit concert, these co-headliners will showcase two notably different songwriting philosophies. Isbell, formerly of the alt-country group Drive-By Truckers, sings straightforwardly, but insightfully, about addiction, anxiety and the South. Father John Misty, the ex-Fleet Fox and full-time provocateur whose real name is Josh Tillman, opts for more high-concept writing (his most infamous lyric may be the one about Taylor Swift and the Oculus Rift). The British indie-folk singer Jade Bird will open the show. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] SEA WOLF at National Sawdust (June 18-19, 8 p.m.). Alex Brown Church, the creative mind behind this Los Angeles-based band, spins stormy romance and natural imagery into graceful indie-folk melodies. The group’s most recent project, “Song Spells No. 1: Cedarsmoke,” was a more experimental release funded through Kickstarter; in press materials, Church called it “not an official record.” Though it came out nearly five years ago, its songs have never been performed live by the full band. That will change on Tuesday and Wednesday, when they, accompanied by a string quartet, will take the project to the stage for the first time. 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org TANK AND THE BANGAS at the Prospect Park Bandshell (June 20, 7:30 p.m.). In 2017, this band from New Orleans won NPR’s Tiny Desk Contest on the strength of “Quick,” a maximalist story-song that coalesces around the singing, rapping and ineffable charm of the group’s frontwoman: Tarriona Ball, a.k.a. Tank. At the victor’s podium — which is to say, standing behind a desk at NPR headquarters — Ball described her group as a roller coaster of “sound and rhythm and love and light, expression, and things that make you feel whole.” Their free performance in Prospect Park, presented by BRIC as part of its Celebrate Brooklyn! Festival, is sure to be lively. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.orgOLIVIA HORN MELANIE CHARLES at Dizzy’s Club (June 18-22, 11:15 p.m.). Charles, a vocalist, flutist and multi-instrumentalist, takes a prismatic view of black music, turning the past into the future and letting the sounds of the Caribbean beam into her versions of classic American jazz standards. At this late-night show, she will celebrate the legacy of Abbey Lincoln — a landmark vocalist and composer who died in 2010 — with help from the thrilling pianist Marc Cary, who played in Lincoln’s band for many years; the bassist Jonathan Michel; and the drummer Diego Ramirez. 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys GERALD CLEAVER at Nublu 151 (June 16, 9 p.m.). A drummer of marvelous versatility and coolly considered power, Cleaver exhibits a love for thrashing, arrhythmic clatter, but it is matched by his ability to pump quiet energy into a simmering swing beat. He’s a first-call drummer for musicians across the jazz world, but when he performs as a leader, remarkable things tend to happen. He appears at Nublu 151 in an intriguing, atypical quartet featuring three fellow virtuosos: the cellist Tomeka Reid, the violist Mat Maneri and the electronic musician and multidisciplinary artist Daniel Givens. nublu.net SYLVIE COURVOISIER at Happylucky No. 1 (June 14-15, 8 p.m.). The music that Courvoisier, a pianist, plays with the violinist Mark Feldman seems to articulate its own set of standards and intentions: Play with the utmost clarity, but never compromise depth of tone and feeling. Express yourself with a dead-set seriousness, but flee from certainty. Keep a conversation going at all times between the ache of nostalgia and the nervous excitement of anticipation. To hear this private ideology in action, pick up a copy of the duo’s newly released disc, “Time Gone Out,” then go hear them at Happylucky on Saturday. On Friday, Courvoisier performs with a different duet partner: the restlessly iconoclastic guitarist Mary Halvorson.happyluckyno1.com THEO CROKER at Jazz Standard (June 13-16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Last month, Croker logged a vital contribution to the growing body of nouveau jazz fusion (think Robert Glasper, Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, Sarah Elizabeth Charles) when he released “Star People Nation,” an album that gallivants from swirling, left-field hip-hop beats to propellant swing to entrancing passages of African percussion. Through it all, Croker’s understated trumpet playing holds his small band together with swagger and poise. Here he celebrates the album’s release with Mike King on piano, Eric Wheeler on bass and Michael Ode on drums. 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com THE MARTIN FAMILY at the Blue Note (June 13-16, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). The alto saxophonist, keyboardist and producer Terrace Martin has been writing and producing for pop and hip-hop acts in Los Angeles since the early 2000s; all the while, he has moonlighted as a jazz saxophonist. With the meteoric rise of Kendrick Lamar, one of his closest collaborators, Martin managed to become a household name among music fans without sacrificing either side of his artistry. This weekend he brings a bit of personal history to bear, playing in a trio with his father — the R&B drummer Ernest Martin, known as Curly — and the organist Larry Goldings. 212-475-8592, bluenote.net MELVIS SANTA AND KARLEA LYNNÉ at the Cell Theater (June 15, 8 p.m.). A Havana-born singer with a bright and cloudless articulation, Santa connects Afro-Caribbean tradition with an easygoing, contemporary pop sound. Now a New Yorker, she is among the most promising rising talents in her adopted hometown. She will perform at the Cell with a small ensemble, and will be preceded by Lynné, a vocalist with a commitment to jazz’s soul-inflected tradition. Lynné will appear in a quintet featuring Christopher McBride on saxophone, Jonathan Thomas on piano, Noah Jackson on bass and Darrian Douglas on drums. 646-861-2253, thecelltheatre.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. FRANKIE COSMOS at Industry City (June 8, 8 p.m.). In a conversation with The New York Times last year, this bedroom-pop kingpin described her creative mantra as “Isn’t it crazy that I have feelings and exist?” A wildly prolific 25-year-old songwriter, the New York native, born Greta Kline, has spent a decade turning those feelings — which often include both wonderment and existential misery — into hushed, guitar-driven songs at an impressive clip. Kline’s most recent work is a series of short EPs titled “Haunted Items,” which feature concise, vignettelike songs performed alone at the piano. Expect her to play selections from those releases at this performance in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. cityfarmpresents.com INDIA.ARIE at the Beacon Theater (June 9, 8 p.m.). “With all of my albums, I’ve tried to make not just protest music, but message music,” this Grammy-winning soul singer said in a recent interview with Billboard. On some of her best-known songs, like “Video,” from 2001, and “I Am Light,” from 2013, that message has been one of radical self-love. The same theme crops up on a new record released in February — as suggested by its affirming title, “Worthy.” Highlights include “That Magic,” an openhearted tribute to a deserving partner, and the tender, stripped-down ballad “Sacred Space.” 212-465-6000, msg.com LOCAL NATIVES at Brooklyn Steel (June 6-7, 9 p.m.). While the heyday of indie-rock bands may have given way to an upcropping of solo performers, this West Coast group continues to invest in a more communal approach. They describe their latest album, “Violet Street” — named for the location of the Los Angeles warehouse where it was recorded — as some of their most collaborative work, with all five band members forgoing preproduction preparation in order to make the whole thing from scratch, together. The results, strongest on highlights like “When Am I Gonna Lose You” and “Megaton Mile,” refresh their rock roots with strains of synth-pop flair. 888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] TIM MCGRAW at the Beacon Theater (June 10, 8 p.m.). Author is not the most prominent line on this country music heavyweight’s résumé, but in the past two decades he has penned a handful of books for both children and adults. Next week, he’ll release another alongside his co-writer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham. Titled “Songs of America: Patriotism, Protest and the Music That Made a Nation,” it examines songs that have shaped American politics and culture. On a brief tour supporting the book, which kicks off on Monday at the Beacon, the two will discuss the process of writing it, and McGraw will perform a selection of songs featured within its pages. 212-465-6000, msg.com MARISSA NADLER AND STEPHEN BRODSKY at Saint Vitus Bar (June 13, 7 p.m.). Nadler, one half of this experimental duo, first made a name for herself in the early 2000s as a folk singer-songwriter specializing in understated instrumentation and gloomy, gothic imagery. With Brodsky, the singer and guitarist of metalcore groups like Cave In and Mutoid Man, she reaches beyond her signature acoustic palette and dabbles in droning soundscapes and trudging electric guitar. The pair released a collaborative album, “Droneflower,” in April; on Thursday, they will perform at this metal bar in Greenpoint, Brooklyn — the site of their first meeting, back in 2014. saintvitusbar.com TOKIMONSTA at Elsewhere (June 7, 5 p.m.). This Los Angeles-based producer’s story is one of perseverance: After undergoing treatment for moyamoya, a rare brain disease, in early 2016, she temporarily lost her ability to produce language and comprehend music. Her most recent full-length, 2017’s “Lune Rouge,” celebrates her triumphant recovery. More recently, Tokimonsta has used her recuperated gift to champion new artists, releasing a compilation of work by up-and-comers on her own label, Young Art Records. In Bushwick, Brooklyn, she will share a rooftop stage with Rosehardt and Bad Tuner, two artists featured on that compilation; tickets are no longer available online, but a limited number will be sold at the door. elsewherebrooklyn.comOLIVIA HORN CHEICK HAMALA DIABATE at Nublu 151 (June 13, 8 p.m.). In Diabate’s hands, the ngoni — a small West African instrument, between a lute and a guitar — becomes a precision blade. He plays in lickety-split, skittering bursts, but his stroke is tough and strong; it has joyful energy and a spirit of stern, right-minded guidance. Which makes sense, given that Diabate is a griot in the African tradition, responsible for communicating messages of historical awareness and wisdom. He moved to Washington from Mali years ago, but he continues to serve the griot’s role in his adopted home, where he plays weekly and has become one of the city’s most beloved performers. Here he makes a rare New York appearance, joined by a small ensemble. nublu.net ROY HAYNES at the Blue Note (June 10-12, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Few living drummers know the plush interior of a solid swing feel better — or are more adept at the wheel of a bebop combo — than the 94-year-old Haynes, a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master and an unimpeachable authority on classic jazz drumming. His energetic, dashing style has showed up on hundreds of albums, including many from Sarah Vaughan and Sonny Rollins. In recent decades he has led his own group, the Fountain of Youth Band, and from the looks of things, they have been living up to their name. 212-475-8592, bluenote.net CHRISTIAN MCBRIDE BIG BAND at Dizzy’s Club (June 11-16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Rather than harking back to the classic swing era or the progressive large-ensemble composers of the late 20th century, this 17-piece group picks up on a lesser-touted aspect of the jazz tradition: the bebop big bands led by Jimmy Heath and Dizzy Gillespie in the 1940s and ’50s. A lot of activity often happens at once in McBride’s ensemble: spitfire soloing from the saxophones and brass; calisthenic bowed-bass workouts from the bandleader; sprightly, charging momentum from the rhythm section. But McBride makes sure everything coheres, thanks to hip-huggingly tight swing rhythms and generous coats of grease on the harmonies. 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys MYRA MELFORD at the Stone (June 11-15, 8:30 p.m.). As a bandleader, Melford finds a happy balance between assiduous precision and flagrant risk, and her quintet Snowy Egret’s recent album was a highlight of 2018. The group’s scrabbling interplay can feel so physical that it makes you reach for synesthetic comparisons: Sometimes it resembles a work of experimental choreography; elsewhere you might think of an abstract film, moving steadily from bleak darkness to cool light. Snowy Egret will play the closing night of this run at the Stone; on the four preceding dates, Melford will play in a different trio or quartet each night. thestonenyc.com DAVID SÁNCHEZ’S CARIB at Jazz Standard (June 6-9, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A member of the prestigious SFJAZZ Collective, Sánchez uses his titanic gifts on the tenor saxophone to draw bold connecting lines between Afro-Caribbean tradition and the sound of contemporary New York jazz. On Friday he will release “Carib,” an album integrating traditional West African rhythms — often by way of Haiti and Sánchez’s native Puerto Rico — into sinuous original compositions. At Jazz Standard he will play selections from the album with Lage Lund on guitar, Ed Simon on piano, Ricky Rodriguez on bass, Obed Calvaire on drums, and Jhan Lee Aponte and Markus Schwartz doubling on percussion. 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com VISION FESTIVAL at Roulette (June 11-16). Now in its 24th year, this festival has become a tradition unto itself, and a steadying force for New York’s community of free-jazz musicians and radically minded improvisers. The 2019 edition kicks off with a night of music of Andrew Cyrille, a fabled drummer and this year’s lifetime achievement honoree. Other highlights include a performance on Wednesday by the tenor saxophonist Kidd Jordan, dedicated to his longtime collaborator Alvin Fielder (who died in January), and a trio set on June 14 from the pianist Kris Davis, the bassist William Parker and the drummer Jeff Watts. This year for the first time, the festival also features a three-day FreeJazz Convention, held on the afternoons of June 14 to 16.212-254-5420, artsforart.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. JOJO ABOT at the Sultan Room (June 29, 8 p.m.). The newest addition to the bustling night life scene in Bushwick, Brooklyn, this club tucked behind the Turk’s Inn restaurant — a tribute to a onetime Wisconsin supper club whose name it shares — has had a busy first week of programming. On Saturday, it will host a release party for Abot, a Ghanian-born singer, rapper and performance artist whose music is grounded in bold visuals and tinged with Afrofuturism. Her new EP, titled “Power to the God Within” — part of a series of multimedia exhibitions — ambitiously continues the explorations of oppression, blackness and divinity that drove her 2017 release, “Ngiwunkulunkulu” (which means “I am God” in Zulu). thesultanroom.com DRIVE-BY TRUCKERS at Brooklyn Bowl (through June 29, 8 p.m.). Politics and contemporary country music have an uneasy relationship, to say the least — artists inclined to speak their conscience often do so at the risk of being ostracized by the genre’s radio gatekeepers. This alt-country group from Athens, Ga., has long bucked the expectation of apoliticism, but never more willfully than on their most recent album, 2016’s “American Band.” Its songs, like “What It Means” and “Ever South,” address topics such as gun violence and immigration. This weekend, they will close out a six-night run at this concert hall in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com EMPATH at Pioneer Works (June 28, 7 p.m.). This Philadelphia-based quartet makes songs that are as catchy as they are unorthodox. On “Active Listening: Night on Earth” — their debut album, released in May on the queer-forward punk label Get Better Records — the group splices pop hooks with hardcore fervor and New Agey embellishments, to delightful ends. Their appearance at this art space in Red Hook, Brooklyn, is copresented by The Baffler and will kick off Press Play, a two-day book and music fair. Empath will be joined by their label mates Control Top, a postpunk trio.pioneerworks.org LIZ PHAIR at Prospect Park Bandshell (June 29, 7 p.m.). In the mid-90s, this renowned singer-songwriter became, as she told The New York Times last year, an “accidental feminist spokesperson.” That was due to the release of “Exile in Guyville,” a collection of scrappy guitar songs noted for what was then considered a brazen expression of sexuality and its condemnation of male apathy, penned in response to the Rolling Stones’ “Exile on Main Street.” More than a quarter-century later, Phair’s influence is manifest in young artists like Soccer Mommy and Lindsey Jordan (Snail Mail), who once played in a Phair cover band. In Prospect Park, she appears alongside the punk shape-shifter Ted Leo and the wry songwriter Caroline Rose. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org PHONY PPL at Mercury Lounge (June 29-30, 7:30 p.m.). Though all five members of this Brooklyn-based group are under 30, they’ve been playing together for more than a decade. Since forming in 2008, the band has gone through lineup changes and lulls, and several members have explored side projects; still, their chemistry is stronger than ever on “mo’za-ik,” their sixth album, released in October. The record traverses dreamy R&B (“Way Too Far”), playful hip-hop (“Before You Get a Boyfriend”) and politically charged soul (“on everythinG iii love”). Expect them to play selections from the album during their two-night stand at this club on the Lower East Side. Saturday night’s performance is sold out, but tickets remain for Sunday. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] SCREAMING FEMALES at Industry City (June 28, 8 p.m.). Hailing from nearby New Brunswick, N.J., this experimental rock band has been a commanding presence in alternative music circles. Fourteen years after their founding and long after graduating to bigger stages, they retain the punk ethos of a group that came up through basements and other D.I.Y. hot spots. For this show, presented by City Farm as part of its summer series, they will be joined by Swearin’, the band fronted by Allison Crutchfield and Kyle Gilbride. The group split in 2015 but reunited in late 2017 and last year released “Fall Into the Sun,” a bright, galloping, guitar-driven album on which both singers ponder the passage of time. cityfarmpresents.comOLIVIA HORN STANLEY COWELL at Smoke (June 28-29, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Cowell can make the piano dance by playing in a jaggy rhythm, or simply by manipulating the tone of his harmonies, or by throwing his right and left hands into a thrashing repartee. This weekend run is billed as a look back at his 60-year career, and there’s a lot to celebrate: He came into the jazz consciousness in the 1960s, turning heads with his idiosyncratic style and bold compositional voice; co-founded the influential, independent label Strata-East; and has continued expanding ever since, composing short pieces and long suites, and sometimes experimenting with electronics. Joining him at Smoke are the trumpeter Freddie Hendrix, the saxophonist and flutist Bruce Williams, the bassist Tom DiCarlo and the drummer Vince Ector. 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JEROME HARRIS QUARTET at Bar Lunático (July 1, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). For much of the 1980s and ’90s, Harris served as the guitarist in Sonny Rollins’s band, while also establishing himself as a mainstay of New York’s improvising avant-garde. Harris — who doubles on bass and has conducted scholarly inquiries into some remote corners of the black-music lineage — draws no clear lines of demarcation between African song, mainstream jazz and the avant-garde. He is most often heard as a side musician, but at Lunático he’ll lead a group featuring Jeremy Udden on alto sax, Dave Baron on bass and Lucianna Padmore on drums, with Harris handling guitar and vocals. 718-513-0339, barlunatico.com SEAN JONES at Dizzy’s Club (June 27-29, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). You’re hard-pressed to find a straight-ahead jazz trumpeter with a more powerfully satisfying style: Jones plays with a smoky, magnetic grace, born of his boisterous disposition and almost total command. Through Saturday, he will celebrate the life and legacy of Dizzy Gillespie (the trumpeter for whom the club is named) with “Dizzy Spellz,” a program he wrote with the dancer and vocalist Brinae Ali that addresses how this bebop pioneer interacted with the cultural and spiritual questions of his time. Jones will be joined by Ali, the turntablist Wendel Patrick, the pianist Zaccai Curtis, the bassist Boris Kozlov and the drummer Obed Calvaire. 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys ANAÏS MAVIEL at Roulette (June 28, 8 p.m.). A rising vocalist, movement artist and multi-instrumentalist, Maviel is one of two 2019 Van Lier fellows at Roulette. In that capacity she is preparing and performing new works throughout the year, and on Friday she will present “Time Is Due,” which she calls an “operatic installation” for an electroacoustic ensemble. It interrogates the concepts of coexistence and interdependence, using music as both an embodied concern and a metaphor.

2019,12 Ways the Progressive Takeover Is Transforming New York,"Rent regulations, climate change, gun control and more: Lawmakers pushed through an undeniably liberal agenda. ALBANY — At 7:20 a.m., after an all-night marathon marked by the passage of dozens of bills and a rubber-band fight on the floor of the chamber, the Legislature on Friday finally ended a 2019 session that was nothing short of groundbreaking. During the six-month session, lawmakers approved a raft of legislation, large and small. The Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, reached expansive agreements on rent regulation, climate change, criminal justice, congestion pricing, sexual harassment and gun control, to name just a few. There were deals to ban various and sundry things, from cat declawing to floating billboards to bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts. With Democrats leading both chambers for the first time in nearly a decade, the agenda was undeniably liberal, often landmark, and for those in the majority, making up for lost time. “This year our goals were finally within reach,” said Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker, to his groggy colleagues during a breakfast-time farewell on Friday. “Much of our bold and visionary agenda was finally realized.” Republicans had a different take, suggesting that Democratic leaders were ignoring the needs of middle-class taxpayers in favor of advancing a socialist agenda. So what did you miss? Here’s what the New York State government got done in the wee hours, and the six months before. In terms of immediate impact on the most people, the recent deal on rent was the most striking: a wide-ranging agreement to extend rent regulation, stem the ability of landlords to raise rents, and a cap on rent hikes based on building improvements, among other overhauls. The deal, which was struck by the Legislature with little input from Mr. Cuomo, was a blow to landlords and real estate interests, who had fared well with a Republican-led Senate, and a major win for the progressive Democrats who had ousted them. Earlier in the year, developers had also been hit with a new transfer tax on high-value homes — known as a mansion tax — though they successfully fought off an annual pied-à-terre tax that they considered even more onerous. With the Trump administration rolling back emissions standards and temperatures still rising, New York lawmakers positioned the state as a world leader in fighting global warming, passing an ambitious plan to try to all but eliminate its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Under the plan, which had stalled for several years in the face of Republican opposition, the state will establish a 22-person climate action council, which will have two years to formulate a plan for how the state will go about meeting the emissions goals. After that, state agencies will be charged with implementing the plan, which environmentalists imagine could mean everything from banning gas-guzzling cars to planting new forests as carbon sinks. The state also acted to ban plastic bags, an unsightly scourge in many locales, though paper bags were left less regulated. Perhaps the centerpiece of April’s state budget deal was a slate of criminal justice agreements, which advocates hailed as transformational. Cash bail was abolished for all but certain violent felonies, which could help 90 percent of people charged with a crime avoid pretrial incarceration. Prosecutors are also required to reveal possibly exculpatory evidence to the defense far earlier in the discovery process. And speedy trials are now guaranteed. In May, the Legislature also acted to legalize so-called gravity knives — small, easy-to-access blades, opened with a flick of the wrist — overturning a law had resulted in the arrest of tens of thousands of black and Latino New Yorkers. But an effort to ban the long-term use of solitary confinement in jails and prisons failed, though Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders announced a series of changes late Thursday, with promises to work toward a 30-day cap on stints in solitary. Another budget highlight was a congestion pricing plan, to charge cars that enter the busiest parts of Manhattan, after more than a decade of foiled attempts by lawmakers. Frustration with the city’s deteriorating subway system, coupled with concerns about gridlock, helped usher through a proposal that had been around since Michael R. Bloomberg was mayor. The fees, which have yet to be set, will not go into effect until 2021. The Reproductive Health Act was one of the first bills the Legislature tackled this year, codifying Roe v. Wade into state law and guaranteeing women’s rights to an abortion after the 24th week of pregnancy when there is “an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s life or health.” The bill was central to many Democrats’ campaign pledges, but it infuriated the Catholic Church, something Mr. Cuomo, a Catholic, said he was acutely aware of. “That made the Catholic Church and many anti-abortion people very, very unhappy,” he said in a radio interview this week. “So yes, there are political consequences, there’s no doubt.” Indeed, national Republicans, including President, Trump immediately seized onto New York’s law, promising to make it a campaign issue. Amid a federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants at the nation’s southern border and across the country, New York this week offered a potential benefit to such residents: the opportunity to get a driver’s license. An estimated 265,000 people would directly benefit, and supporters said it would increase road safety and reduce insurance costs. The issue was a heavy lift for Democrats, with the entirety of the party’s six-person Long Island delegation voting no, fearful of electoral consequences in moderate suburban areas. A previous effort in 2007, under Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, had collapsed in the face of negative public opinion. In January, lawmakers also approved a bill to give undocumented college students access to state financial aid and scholarships. Gay and transgender rights groups were thrilled with several developments early in the session. They included a ban on so-called “conversion therapy” — the debunked practice of trying to change sexual orientation or gender identity — as well as the passage of the Gender Expression Nondiscrimination Act, or Genda, which prohibits discrimination based on “gender identity or expression” by employers and others. On Wednesday, the Legislature banned so-called gay panic defenses, whereby defendants could argue that they had acted in a state of temporary insanity caused and justified by their victim’s sexual orientation. But some were disappointed as a push to legalize gestational surrogacy fell short. The passage of early voting in January was a victory for voting rights advocates in New York, who had watched as dozens of other states had embraced some form of the system. Another significant, if less heralded, electoral reform was banning the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which had allowed corporations to pour almost unlimited amounts of money into election races through multiple limited liability companies. Six years after the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Conn., spurred Mr. Cuomo to shepherd through a major gun safety package, making New York the first state to act after the tragedy, lawmakers passed a set of additional restrictions. The new laws ban bump stocks, prohibit teachers from carrying guns in schools and extend the waiting period for gun buyers who do not pass an instant background check. In the final days of the session, lawmakers granted collective bargaining rights to the state’s farmworkers, who had been requesting stronger protections for more than two decades. The workers would be allowed overtime pay and guaranteed rest periods. After years of appeals from women’s and workers’ rights groups, fueled especially by the #MeToo movement, the Legislature on Wednesday approved some of the most robust anti-harassment laws in the country. The bills eliminated the “severe or pervasive” standard for proving harassment in court and restricted employers’ ability to avoid liability. The statute of limitations for second-degree rape was also extended from 5 years to 30, and for third-degree rape to 10 years. Unable to reach agreement on a deal to fully legalize marijuana, lawmakers on Thursday agreed on something of a half-measure, passing a bill that will further decriminalize possession of the drug and automatically expunge many low-level marijuana convictions across the state. The measure would treat possession of up to two ounces of marijuana as a violation instead of a crime. Still, given the nation’s rapidly changing sentiment about marijuana, the failure to fully legalize was considered a defeat of sorts in Albany. More than a dozen states have decriminalized the drug.",The New York Times
2019,13 Artists Reflect on the Stonewall Riots,"50 years ago, the Stonewall Inn became the center of the gay rights movement after a series of riots broke out. Its influence on these artists still reverberates. The Stonewall Inn, a mob-owned gay bar in New York’s West Village, was an easy target for surprise raids in the late 1960s. Busts were common, riots were not, so when the police began making arrests in the early hours of June 28, 1969, no one expected resistance. But that night, the crowd erupted. People hurled insults, then coins, beer cans and bricks. Reinforcements rushed to the scene as Stonewall supporters poured out of neighboring dives to join the melee. Half destroyed, Stonewall reopened the following night. The rioters returned, singing protest songs, and so did the police, armed with tear gas. The clashes, which continued on Christopher Street for days, were barely covered in the news, but they altered the course of history. The Stonewall riots electrified the nascent gay-liberation movement with urgent, ferocious energy during a time when homosexuality was illegal in 49 states and widely considered to be a mental disorder. Suddenly, what had been a nonviolent push for civil liberties became an uncompromising crusade. The protests catalyzed the formation of radical civil rights groups, in New York and across the United States. A year later, the first pride march set out from Stonewall, growing from several hundred people to several thousand as it moved up Sixth Avenue. This year, more than four million people are expected to attend the city’s annual celebration. To mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, T Magazine invited a multigenerational group of artists to reflect on the demonstrations and their legacy. “Today, there’s a lot of infighting about who threw the first brick,” observes Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt, an artist who was at the bar that summer night, in his response below. (Lanigan-Schmidt’s work is currently on view in “Art After Stonewall, 1969–1989,” a joint exhibition at New York University’s Grey Art Gallery and the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art — one of several shows throughout the country devoted to the protests and their aftermath. Others can be found at the Brooklyn Museum and Contemporary Arts Museum Houston.) But the riots, he reminds us, were only possible because of the solidarity of the many different groups who joined forces 50 years ago. “Stonewall was very diverse, and it was unified in its diversity.” [Coming soon: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] I am grateful for the rich role of the anecdotal in queer activism and life, for the collective memory that keeps our stories alive regardless of their inclusion in the official record. I remember hearing about Stonewall from friends and community elders as a young queer person, not just about the riots but about Stonewall’s role as a refuge, a place that turned away no one. Whether you drank or not, you could spend the whole night there for the democratic price of $3. It has always been a space where many precarious subjects — including people who are poor, of color, gender nonconforming, young and homeless — could find shelter. This aspect of Stonewall serves as a signpost for me and many other queer folks of my generation (people who came of age in the ’90s) as we made space within the mainstream gay movement for diverse sites of action and community such as the Audre Lorde Project, the Clit Club, the Lesbian Herstory Archives, as well as groups like South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association (SALGA) and Gay Asian and Pacific Islander Men of New York (GAPIMNY). As for Stonewall legacies now? I am excited to see so many diverse and rapidly growing queer communities — the landscape is profoundly different from what I was able to access 25 years ago. It’s amazing that there are queer elders and queer children who are active and visible agents of change, and that there has been so much language, organizing and community built around trans sexualities. So there is growth, but it is equally important for me to remember that the Stonewall riots happened during a time of widespread social movements in the United States, a time that was in many ways far more open than the present. These events represent a shrinking space we need to fight for. They remind me of the importance of the convergence of multiple uprisings, of allegiances across gender, race, class and sexuality. I trace the lineage of my own encounters with the breadth and texture of femmeness, its material and visceral resonances, to this time. All of this is at the heart of our work and play as we move forward. When the Stonewall riots occurred, I was living with someone who was not only my high school sweetheart but the man I had been planning to marry when I graduated from Pratt Institute. Religious differences prevented the marriage. Months later, I met and fell in love with a woman. I was then told, as a lesbian, that I would lose my home, my job, my family and everything I hold dear. I was the exact same person I was in June 1969, and yet my rights were gone. This was simply unacceptable, and I joined the Gay Liberation Front, which planned the first Gay Pride March. My first piece of political art was the poster I made for that march, which read: “I am your worst fear, I am your best fantasy.” As with all the other stereotypes foisted upon me as a lesbian, I was appalled that we were sought out as erotic fantasies by the same people who, when confronted with real flesh-and-blood lesbians, were deathly afraid. We didn’t want or need them. Coming out of the Gay Liberation Front and its focus on social justice and intersectionality, it would have been impossible for me not to continue defying stereotypes, injustice and repression. I was an outlaw then, and I remain an outlaw today. I moved to New York in 1979, 10 years after the Stonewall riots. When you’re in your early 20s, 10 years might as well be 100. In that time, a lot of L.G.B.T. culture had flourished, and I remember going to my first pride march. Back then, the women and the men (there was no other category) marched separately. A lot of lesbians had very good friends who were men, but the politics of those two groups were moving in different directions. That was a rift that didn’t really heal until the AIDS epidemic, which began a few years later. So yes, Stonewall was talked about, but there was really a feeling among lesbians and feminists — not entirely historically accurate — that it was about men, and that we needed our own movement and our own march. Even today, I think the gay identities that have made it into the mainstream tend to be mostly male, white and middle class. Women, trans people and people of color are still fighting for recognition. I think it’s important that activists and scholars remind us that the people who led the uprising at Stonewall weren’t white men working at Fortune 500 companies. They may have seduced those men, but they themselves were working class and had various gender expressions. A lot of them were of color. I think of Stonewall as a space where queerness can flourish because it’s off the radar and those kinds of small queer spaces continue to exist — maybe not so much bars, but salons in people’s homes and other places. [Read more: The Night the Stonewall Inn Became a Proud Shrine] It felt huge when President Obama named Stonewall a national monument. I see that there’s even a park ranger. Stonewall was an explosion of queer fury against normative culture and the police state, and the people involved have sort of gone extinct as a species in that area; it feels pretty heteronormative and conventional at this point. So I’d like to volunteer as a Stonewall park ranger and do some habitat restoration. I’m going to bring back the indigenous queer species. You know, put the camp back in camping. The freedom to look how I look and to act how I act are forms of progress hard-won by queer people who fought, at Stonewall and elsewhere, for years. The stones thrown, the bones broken and the lives lost are with me now as I pursue my practice. I am grateful for these gifts, and conscious that not everyone like me can enjoy them — and that I, too, cannot enjoy them everywhere. As long as I stay in a coastal city or in a “Western” society, though, I can look how I look and I will not get beat up for sport (well, not often). I do not wish to take these freedoms for granted, but I’m not sure how to reflect on Stonewall, or how to situate my own nonbinary trans body in relation to the demonstrations, when our home is on fire. Queer or not, we are all living on a rapidly warming planet and contributing to its ruin. I make films and videos that imagine different worlds with different rules, and I make other works that live very concretely in the muddle of our current reality. I sell them and I participate. No matter my gender or appearance, I consume, and to consume means that I contribute to the stresses on the planet. What does it mean for me to participate in a system that is actively dismantling the earth? What does it mean that I situate my life and dreams in this time period? How do I imagine a whole different system if I have only known one? My ears are ringing, it is getting very warm. The biggest fight of my generation and the generation behind me is for our right to live on this planet. I look to Stonewall and I think about direct action, about violence, about the act of rising upward; most of all I think about the pain inherent in desiring a peaceful, just future. For now we continue, we demand change and we persevere. The Stonewall riots occurred at a unique time in Greenwich Village. There was a lot of class mixing in the 1960s that didn’t happen as much later on. I had run away from home and was living on the street, and most of my friends were also homeless. But what was magical and amazing was that, on the stoops along Christopher Street, you’d find street kids and N.Y.U. students all socializing together with no condescension. The riot ignited from person to person because that connection was already there. That cross-pollination is very important, and so was the confidence of the ’60s that we could achieve great things for humanity. Tremendous excitement came from the civil rights movement — naturally, we wanted our rights, too. “Scare drag” was a very important aspect of that world. It’s rarely talked about today, but back then it was against the law to wear any kind of drag. As a man, you had to have at least three articles of men’s clothing on (and that didn’t include socks). But teenagers are endlessly inventive. “Scare drag” meant wearing all men’s clothing, but giving it feminine accents, like knotting your T-shirt to create a little bra line. Someone with longish hair (this was the time of Beatle haircuts) might put on hair spray and tease it up a little, give it a slight bouffant. It was very freaky looking — it looked queer in every sense of the word. But it all had to be done so that it could be squashed down into something masculine if a cop came along. The braver queens would put grease paint on their eyelids and then put glitter onto that. It wasn’t like it is today, when you can just go into Duane Reade and buy glitter. They used broken glass, like squashed Christmas ornaments, or shards of metal. Some did end up in the emergency room, but they took it in stride; I never heard anyone say, “Don’t do that again.” [Read more: What Was Your Stonewall? Pivotal L.G.B.T.Q. Moments Across the U.S.] Stonewall opened in 1967, when I was a teenager. It was very inconspicuous from the outside, not like it is now. It had black plywood over the window and a guy would look through a peephole to decide whether you should get in or not. Inside, it was amazing — I had never thought that there were that many gay people in the world, and here they all were dancing with each other. I would say the décor was “mafia utilitarian.” The whole place was black inside. You could buy two kinds of beer: house beer, which is like some watered-down god-knows-what, or you could get cans of beer that probably fell off a truck. There were people called “waiters” who went around like spies, making sure people were spending money. So what you did was you found a can of beer that someone else had put aside and just filled it halfway with water. The waiter would sniff it, and it would still smell like beer, but he wasn’t going to take a chance and taste it. He would just feel the weight. And then you could dance for the rest of the night and not be bothered. The police came a few times a week and it was humiliating. That was the most horrible part — it was taken as a given that they could walk in and assault you, pinch or grab your ass, and just laugh hysterically. They felt that they could get away with putting people down. What was different about that night? They told us to stop dancing. Slow dancing is an affirmation of being — you’re holding onto each other. It comes from the gut and the heart and the soul. And so the riot itself came from the gut and the heart and the soul. It wasn’t a big thought-through thing. We just felt they couldn’t treat us that way and fought back. Today, I don’t think people always understand that the event itself was very diverse. It was activated through the street queens, but the other kids jumped in very quickly, and they had better organizational skills and could start forming different gay organizations within a matter of days. No one group ever dominated this thing. Now there’s a lot of infighting about who threw the first brick. I never really think about that. I first visited New York City in 1980, when I was in high school. All of the tourist destinations that I wanted to see happened to be bars: the Stonewall Inn, the Cedar Tavern, CBGB’s and the bar at the Algonquin Hotel. Walking into Stonewall, I felt overwhelmed, moved. It still has that effect on me. It’s sacred ground, a place of pilgrimage. Of course, this was the site of the 1969 riot that accelerated the gay rights movement. But what I remember sensing, as I stood there in the center of the room, was that well before the demonstrations, this had been the site of many personal revolutions. I thought about how it had been a safe space for many people’s firsts — first kisses, first flirtations, the first time they hit on someone they actually wanted to hit on and how that person may have become their first love. On that day, I felt connected to a secret lineage and network that had a past and a present and a definite future, one that doesn’t need to be secret anymore. Community is like breathing: We do not think about it until it is compromised, but when it becomes threatened, we will fight ferociously to preserve it. I actually cannot fathom the mind-set of my queer ancestors at Stonewall 50 years ago. Yes, I can relate to being closeted. I have felt the necessity of self-censorship, the fear that being yourself can result in unwanted attention or violence and what it means to compartmentalize and fracture oneself, even around friends and relatives. Still, I have always known refuge from the closet. Refuge in my blood family, which includes four generations of openly gay people, and refuge in my chosen family, forged in gay bars across the country. Intellectually, I can recognize the scarcity of public community that queers faced 50 years ago and how very precious Stonewall must have been to the queers who had to muster the courage to go inside a known gay venue. But I cannot really know the psychic burden that accompanies so little relief from the closet. I keep returning to an observation of the Stonewall veteran Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: “Nowhere else could we dance slow.” For me, that sentence encapsulates the urgent need for spaces of contact, connection and intimacy. We need to have moments when we can let our hair down, when a foundation of shared understanding creates a space where we don’t always need to explain where we’re coming from, where we don’t need to speak for every member of our community because we are with and among our community. Fifty years later, Stonewall reminds me to give thanks and to actively defend the spaces where I can slow down, slow dance and be fully myself. I first came to New York in the late ’90s, sometime before going to college at Tisch. I had known about Stonewall from reading all the gay magazines — I had a subscription to The Advocate and Out in high school — where you get your Gay 101. But when I was young, I wasn’t really thinking much about the riots. After spending time in New York, and just by getting older, I’ve started to realize those blind spots. We live in the effects of Stonewall. It’s interesting that the 50th anniversary of Stonewall is happening now, when we’re seeing upswing of identity politics in art and an artist’s sexuality or gender is read as super meaningful for the work. I wonder what the 30th anniversary of Stonewall was like in the mid-90s, when the art world was really over identity politics. It’s not always going to be in fashion, but the artists are still going to be here, and the work is still going to be made. The riots happened one night when the police came to Stonewall. They had harassed the people there one too many times, brought violence into the bar one too many times, and people had to stand up. But I’m interested in what happened before the riots — the space that was created, the intimacies and social relations, the ways of viewing and seeing each other when the police weren’t looking. In my photography, I’m interested in how viewing and touch are related to queer social spaces, and how those things are inseparable. If there is any aspect of Stonewall that relates to my work, it’s what was happening in the bar before the protest, when people were just there encountering one another. I’m thinking about how two people might have caught eyes across the room, and how that moment of recognition might have then led to them walking down Hudson Street. I’m interested in Stonewall on the nights when people were just having fun. My interest in the Stonewall riots stems largely from my search for trans forebears, a search for a history in the wake of cultural erasure enacted by both assimilationist gay rights movements and by the dominant, heteronormative, white supremacist culture of the United States. This search led me to the Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR), a trans activist group founded by Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson in the wake of the riots. There are disputing narratives about the roles that Rivera and Johnson played in the Stonewall riots, and the significance of the uprising itself seems to be recast every 10 years or so. But it was nourishing for me to find a legacy of radical, badass trans activists living their lives beyond a rigid gender binary. A number of my works explicitly engage STAR’s legacy, including the textile works “The Hudson River Jordan” (2018) and “Street Transvestites 1973” (2015), as well as the collage and drawing “S.T.A.R.” of 2012, which are currently on view in the Brooklyn Museum’s exhibition “Nobody Promised You Tomorrow.” While each of these works carries a distinct visual presence and asks something different of the viewer, they all pay homage to the forebears of the current generation of trans justice organizers. With these works, I hope to help lift Rivera and Johnson out of the historical shadows, celebrating their courage and beauty, while pointing simultaneously to the violence they virulently fought against and to the violence of historical erasure. I think we can trace most aspects of how we live our lives as a gay married couple and socially engaged artists back to Stonewall, from our feeling that as queer artists it is our responsibility to make overtly political work to our belief that the fight for equal rights remains both vital and urgent. Our primary body of work is an ongoing series of installations made in response to pre-Stonewall queer histories from each state. Like much of the historical record, the most clearly documented and best preserved stories are often those of cisgender affluent white men. I think that the lens through which we look at these histories and our dedication to digging deeper is indelibly shaped by knowing how central trans people, lesbians, people of color, and poor people were to Stonewall. Our video installation “Political Gestures” at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston includes a 1979 speech by the Houston activist Dr. Charles Law in which he says, “I am afraid that we will find that those gay people who do not come across as being offensively gay, militantly gay, obviously gay, adamantly gay or admittedly gay will be the ones to reap the benefits … of this struggle.” We hope that as we examine our nation’s diverse queer history, we do some justice to the legacy of the outsiders who were on the front lines at Stonewall, and the faeries, the dykes and the faggots of every stripe who made the world we now occupy possible. As a black nonbinary transfemme teenager growing up in Newark, N.J., I didn’t know of any other people like me, in real life or history. During my freshman year at Stanford, I took a queer studies course, where I first learned about the Stonewall riots. I was empowered through learning about people like Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera and other black and Puerto Rican activists and artists who transgressed normative gender and resisted the forms of oppression that confined their lives. I was especially empowered by learning about their struggles against the carceral system, the police state, economic injustice and trans misogyny. The Stonewall riots and the gay liberation movement were catalyzed by poor black and Puerto Rican folks, people who were referred to as street queens, people who went to bars to get drunk and dance, to find community and joy. These were racial, sexual and gender deviants who were politically and economically disenfranchised, who created networks of care for each other and who took to the street to resist various forms of state violence. Contemporary L.G.B.T. politics often forgets and neglects queer, trans and gender nonconforming folks from the hood, the banji girls, those of us who come from under-resourced communities, who are denied access to health care and affordable housing, and who lack viable means of making income. I am inspired by the vision of those street queens from Stonewall and the gay liberation front who envisioned a world for those of us who are trans/gressive in myriad ways to live multifaceted lives of deep satisfaction, interdependence, self-actualization and profound joy. Through art making and community organizing, I have come to understand that the Stonewall riots were led by those most impacted by police violence, incarceration and regulation of sex and gender — and that the riots were part of a long lineage of resistance that extends before and after Stonewall. This was not part of the Pride narrative I was exposed to initially. Acts of resistance are so often flattened into one narrative and cut off from a broader social context in order to dull their shine and impact, and to limit the power of our imagination. This has pushed me to ask: What other bodies, sites and legacies have been systematically erased and evicted from the “official” historical record? As an artist and a storyteller, how might I aesthetically, conceptually and tactically intervene in that historical erasure process and offer up something new, reimagined and unruly? Positioning past and present in conversation reveals how historical events inextricably shape contemporary life, and it can help us to locate new pathways forward. Looking at the post-Stonewall community organizing undertaken by Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) could teach us a lot about what’s happening now, how we might do things differently, and how to honor both our struggles and desires.

In celebration of Canada Day, City Parks Foundation has paired the group with the Courtneys, a pop-punk group from Vancouver, for a free doubleheader at the newly renovated stage in Central Park’s Rumsey Playfield. The opener will be Ellis, the hazy dream-pop project of the songwriter Linnea Siggelkow, whose recent EP is aptly titled “The Fuzz.” 212-360-1399, cityparksfoundation.org ASSEMBLY at the Kitchen (June 22, 6:30 p.m.; June 23, 4 p.m.; through June 30). Across three weekends this month, one of New York’s oldest and grittiest experimental art nonprofits is clearing out three floors of its offices and performances spaces so that an assortment of musicians and artists can stage sound interventions. Organized in part by Kevin Beasley, who recently exhibited at the Whitney, the series aims to expose and recontextualize the structure of cultural spaces. Highlights from the coming weekend include Mhysa, the pop star alter ego of the interdisciplinary artist E. Jane, who will perform on Saturday, and stud1nt, a Queens-based D.J. and a member of the femme-forward Discwoman collective, who will appear on Sunday. 212-255-5793, thekitchen.org JASON ROBERT BROWN at the Town Hall (June 24, 8 p.m.). In 2014, this Tony Award-winning composer, who wrote “The Last Five Years” and “Songs for a New World,” began what he thought was a yearlong residency at SubCulture, the Greenwich Village performance space favored by the contemporary classical crowd. A half-decade later, Brown is preparing for the 50th concert of his tenure. To honor the occasion, on Monday he will play this much-larger stage in Midtown, joined by another storied Broadway songwriter: Stephen Sondheim. The two will perform songs from their respective repertoires, accompanied by a 16-piece orchestra and a guest vocalist, the actress Katrina Lenk. 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] CIRCUIT DES YEUX at Union Pool (June 23, 2 p.m.). The summertime outdoor music landscape in New York seems to expand every year, but Summer Thunder — Union Pool’s contribution to the crowded market, running every Sunday afternoon until September — has been around for nearly a decade. This week, the bill is topped by this experimental folk project from Haley Fohr. Performing as Circuit des Yeux, she pairs dense, foggy electronic soundscapes with acoustic instruments and lays her greatest musical asset — her rich, operatic baritone — on top. The results, heard on songs like “Philo” and “Paper Bag” from her recent album, “Reaching for Indigo,” are transfixing. union-pool.com ONLY IN QUEENS FESTIVAL at Flushing Meadows Corona Park (June 23, 5 p.m.). The drummer, singer and songwriter Sheila E. is rarely written about without reference to Prince, her most famous collaborator and onetime fiancé, but she boasts a stacked musical résumé, even without her “Sign o’ the Times”-era stint in his band. The daughter of the percussionist Pete Escovedo and the niece of the alt-rocker Alejandro Escovedo, Sheila E. grew up playing with family before branching out to support the likes of Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye and Diana Ross, and launching her own solo career with hits such as “The Glamorous Life” and “The Belle of St. Mark.” She will appear at this free show in Queens alongside Musiq Soulchild, a Philadelphia-born R&B singer. 212-360-1399, cityparksfoundation.org LEIF VOLLEBEKK at Rough Trade NYC (June 25, 8 and 10:15 p.m.). In 2017, after a period of creative exhaustion drove him to temporarily retire many of his original songs in favor of covers, this Ottawa-born, Montreal-based singer-songwriter re-emerged with an album titled “Twin Solitude.” Its songs, like “All Night Sedans” and “Big Sky Country,” are pensive and restless, blossoming with stream-of-consciousness verses that bear the marks of long nights spent alone on the road. On Tuesday night, Vollebekk will perform two intimate sets at this record shop and concert space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; the first is sold out, but tickets are available for the later show. roughtradenyc.comOLIVIA HORN NUBYA GARCIA at Nublu 151 (June 26, 8 p.m.). Poised but insistent, youthful but astute, this tenor saxophonist is at the fore of a major musical movement in London, where a flock of young improvisers is defining a rhythm-focused, heartbeat-hastening style that’s informed by electronic music and Caribbean influences, as much as by jazz’s classic lineage. This summer will see the release of a fine debut album by Nérija, a collective featuring Garcia and six other young talents from across that London scene. But at Nublu she will be at the helm of her own small ensemble. nublu.net MILFORD GRAVES at Gavin Brown’s Enterprise (June 27, 8 p.m.). The top line on Graves is that he played in some of the most influential free-jazz groups of the 1960s, revolutionizing the role of the drummer by commingling Afro-Caribbean influences with a general aversion to any previously established idea. But there’s more to his story: He’s also a martial artist, an herbalist and a researcher into cardiovascular health who has designed his own systems of treatment. At this show, presented by Blank Forms, the 77-year-old Graves will debut “Music Meets Medicine and Science,” a new piece using sound samples taken from patients’ heartbeats; melodies Graves has extrapolated from those beats; and his own live, improvised drumming. The performance will be followed by a discussion and workshop, featuring Graves with some of his students: the musicians Akash Mittal, Dor Ben-Amotz, Shahzad Ismaily and Jake Meginsky. blankforms.org JAZZMEIA HORN at Jazz Standard (through June 23, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Horn is among the most exciting young vocalists in jazz, with a proud traditionalism that keeps her tightly linked to the sound of classic figures like Nancy Wilson and Betty Carter, but a vivacity of spirit and conviction that places her firmly in the present. This August she will release a new album, “Love and Liberation,” that maintains the classicist sound that guided her debut album (“A Social Call,” from 2017), but puts a heavier focus on Horn’s original compositions. She’ll draw upon that new material at the Standard, where she’s joined by Irwin Hall on tenor saxophone, Josh Evans on trumpet, Keith Brown on piano, Ben Williams on bass and Anwar Marshall on drums. (On Thursday, Stacy Dillard will be on saxophone instead of Hall, and Ralph Peterson will occupy the drum chair.) 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com BRAD MEHLDAU QUINTET at the Village Vanguard (through June 23, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). At the heart of Mehldau’s music has always lain a balance of absolute command and urgent, unsettled momentum. Sometimes he uses an odd time signature to communicate a feeling of restless propulsion; elsewhere he simply adds a hint of swing to a seemingly straight rhythm. On “Finding Gabriel,” a new album that mixes electronic and acoustic instruments, he seeks answers to the Trump era’s most daunting questions, and winds up playing some of his most emphatic and engrossing music in recent years. He’s likely to pull from that album at the Vanguard, where he’s joined by the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, the tenor saxophonist Joel Frahm, the bassist Joe Sanders and the drummer Leon Parker. The shows are sold out, but a standby line will form outside the club 30 to 40 minutes before each set.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com ‘MONK ON GUITARS’ at the Greenwich House Music School (June 25, 7 p.m.). Though frustratingly unsung, the Sound It Out concert series consistently brings some of New York’s boldest and brightest improvisers to a welcoming little room in the heart of the West Village. This show marks the seventh anniversary of the series, and it features a startling roll call of guitarists, all of whom will play music from the Thelonious Monk songbook: Andy Summers (best known as one-third of the Police), Miles Okazaki (who last year released “Work,” a landmark, six-disc collection featuring every known composition by Monk), Steve Cardenas (who compiled a book of lead sheets of all Monk’s tunes), David Gilmore and others. 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org KASSA OVERALL at the Jazz Gallery (June 21-22, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Since December, this drummer, producer and sometime rapper has played once a month at the Jazz Gallery, each time with a different top-flight jazz pianist. The visual artist Nate Lewis has been on hand for most of those shows, collecting photographs and aural inspiration. This weekend Overall presents the finale of his seven-month residency, titled “Time Capsule.” Joined by some surprise guests, he will use live recordings from the previous performances to create new music on the spot. And Lewis will be there to exhibit new works that draw from his listening experiences at the prior concerts. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nycGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO BARBEZ at Joe’s Pub (June 23, 9:30 p.m.). About two years have passed since this mostly New York-based band cast their spell of musical intoxication, in the form of either live performance or recorded material (though they are at work on new songs about the state of the Middle East in the wake of 9/11 for an album they hope to release next year). Seeing as their theramin player now lives in Vienna, a follow-up concert to this show at Joe’s won’t be soon in the offing, so now would be the right time to catch their bewitching brew within which the instrumentation of civilizations — East and West, ancient and modern, the Old World and the New — clash and dance and meld into works of stunning beauty. 212-967-7555, joespub.orgDANIELLE DOWLING",The New York Times

2019,188 Sickly Dogs Hoarded by a One-Time Top Breeder at Westminster,"An animal cruelty investigation of a New Jersey couple has been opened. The pair said: “This wasn’t backyard breeding. Things just went sideways.” [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] There was a time when the mention of the two high-end dog breeders came with a shower of praise and admiration. The New Jersey couple at the helm of Rocky Ridge Russells kennel could proudly boast of dozens of American Kennel Club winners and a 2009 Westminster Kennel Club best in breed champion. But neighbors near their farm in rural Stockton, N.J., had warned of a far less illustrious operation. And on Tuesday, the authorities revealed the scope of the kennel’s troubling truth: Nearly 200 unkempt dogs — some of them pregnant and many that appeared visibly sick — were removed from the home on County Route 519. A “small number” of dogs were found dead on the 10-acre farm, according to an animal welfare official involved in the rescue. The Hunterdon County prosecutor’s office has begun an animal cruelty investigation and the authorities said charges were pending against the homeowners. “It all just got out of hand,” said Martin Strozeski, one of the breeders who lived at the home with his companion and business partner, Marcia Knoster, 70. “This wasn’t backyard breeding,” he added. “Things just went sideways.” At about 8 a.m. on Tuesday, a coalition of animal welfare and law enforcement agencies — including the prosecutor’s office, the State Police, St. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Center and the Monmouth County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals — descended on the property. They reported finding at least 188 Parson Russell Terriers and dachshunds. The rescue came after the couple had previously surrendered 30 terriers to local authorities, prosecutors said. A decade ago, Rocky Ridge was a well-known and respected kennel. In 2009, a Parson Russell Terrier bred by Ms. Knoster (“Keenan”) would win best in breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the world’s oldest and perhaps most respected breed competition. The victory made Keenan the No. 2 Parson Russell Terrier in the United States. Yet even amid that victory, the financial crisis of 2008 had already begun to spell doom for Rocky Ridge, Mr. Strozeski said. “The economy fell out,” he said. “We were in the process of breeding. We were putting people on waiting lists. Then all of a sudden the economy crashed and all of the people just went away.” The lack of interest in terriers created an overflow of dogs, Mr. Strozeski said. Over time, a couple dozen terriers grew to nearly 50. Then 100. Then 150. “We couldn’t give them away,” Mr. Strozeski said. “It was a hobby turned bad.” Mr. Strozeski said the dead dogs were “in the process of being buried.” Some of the rescued dogs were pregnant. Others were suffering from physical wounds, skin conditions and external parasites. Nearly all were scruffy, covered in dirt and showing signs of physical neglect, according to officials with St. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Center. As news of the rescue spread, many social media users reacted with anger and sadness and accused the owners of being hoarders. Mr. Strozeski admitted to being partially responsible for the poor upkeep of the animals, but said the media reports of the rescue had grossly exaggerated the dogs’ living conditions. “They weren’t well cared for, but they had their primary needs — food and water, and I changed their bed everyday,” he said. “I was spending 12 hours a day with these dogs.” A lawyer for the couple, Dante DiPirro, did not return calls for comment. Nora Parker, who works with St. Hubert’s, said the dogs were in neither optimal nor life-threatening conditions. “No dogs needed emergency care or were in dire straits,” she said. “They appeared, most of them, to be well fed. But that’s not all a dog needs. They need space and socialization and human contact, and it appeared they were not getting enough of that.” Most of the dogs are being temporarily housed at St. Hubert’s and are being treated by a staff of veterinarians and behavioral therapists, Ms. Parker said. They will be restored to full health before being placed for adoption, which for some dogs could come as early as next week. Officials with the Westminster Kennel Club would not comment on Ms. Knoster or Mr. Strozeski directly, but they released a statement expressing sadness at the Rocky Ridge rescue. “Supporting and promoting responsible dog breeding and ownership has been a key core value of the Westminster Kennel Club for over 140 years,” the statement read. “We are saddened to learn of this unfortunate situation and are grateful for the care being provided to the affected dogs.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of one of the breeders. He is Martin Strozeski, not Strozenski.",The New York Times
2019,1894: President Carnot of France Assassinated,"International Herald Tribune [BY TELEGRAPH TO THE HERALD.] LYONS, June 25. — The assassination of President Carnot took place practically in daylight at Lyons last evening. He was being entertained at a grand banquet by the Chamber of Commerce and he was received with great enthusiasm by an immense crowd outside the building both on his arrival and his emerging to take his departure. This was about ten minutes past nine and the President’s carriage was drawn up about midway across the place de la Bourse. A military guard of honor was in attendance and police were present in considerable force. THE ATTACK. M. Carnot quickly entered his carriage and was about to take his seat when a young, well-dressed man suddenly rushed from the crowd, and before those in attendance on the President had time to interpose themselves the excited stranger had drawn a dagger out of a roll of news papers and plunged it deeply into M. Carnot’s back. The President fell heavily on the vacant seat and, the nature of the wound being apparent from the copious flow of blood, he was at once driven to the Prefecture and the most eminent doctors available were summoned. THE PRESIDENT DIES. Meanwhile the President had swooned and become wholly unconscious. All that was possible was done to save his life, but a superficial examination showed that the liver had been pierced and there was no shadow of hope of retaining the rapidly ebbing life of the wounded President. He was carefully tended and all that medical science could devise was resorted to, but the internal haemorrhage could not be checked, and M. Carnot, who did not regain consciousness, passed away shortly before one o’clock this morning. THE ASSASSIN. The President’s assassin was seized on the step of the carriage before he had withdrawn the dagger, and was immediately rushed away by a number of officers to save him from the fury of the crowd, whose excitement knew no bounds upon the nature of the attack upon the President becoming known. The prisoner gave the name of Cesario Santo, and described himself as an Italian, aged twenty-one. MOBS AGAINST ITALIANS. Late at night vast and perturbed crowds gathered near the scene of the attack and outside the Prefecture, and, in consequence of the temperament evinced in several directions, the greatest precautions had to be adopted to prevent the places of business or the residences of Italians from being wrecked. As it was, one excited crowd overpowered the police and gendarmerie and practically demolished a large Italian restaurant. PROTECTING THE CONSULATE. Another crowd made towards the Italian Consulate for the purpose of wreaking vengeance, but the authorities had anticipated trouble in this direction, and with a large force of soldiers and police prevented further serious destruction of property. — The New York Herald, European Edition, June 25, 1894",The New York Times
2019,2 Big Book and Magazine Printers Face Suit to Block Their Merger,"The printed page has seen better days. To improve their chances in a struggling industry, two of the largest companies in the business of printing and distributing magazines, books and catalogs last year agreed to a merger deal that was expected to close in the next few months. Not so fast, the Justice Department said. In a lawsuit filed last week in federal court in Chicago, the Justice Department asked for a halt to Quad/Graphics’s planned $1.4 billion purchase of LSC Communications. Lawyers in the department’s antitrust division argued that the merger would decrease competition and drive up prices. Quad publishes every Condé Nast title, including The New Yorker and Vogue, most publications from Hearst Magazines, including O: The Oprah Magazine, and Scholastic books. LSC Communications publishes two magazines from AARP that claim to have the largest circulations in the world, Penguin Random House books and more. Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust, said in a statement that a combination of Quad and LSC Communications would “raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers and, ultimately, American consumers.” In its attempt to block the deal, the Justice Department had two allies from the community of writers: The Authors Guild and PEN America. “The lack of competition among book printers has already caused a bottleneck and increased publishing costs, and a merger between these two companies could exacerbate this situation by creating a monopoly,” the Authors Guild said in a statement in March. That same month, the Authors Guild and PEN America joined the Open Markets Institute, an antitrust think tank based in Washington, in sending a letter to the Justice Department recommending that the merger be blocked. It was imperative that the government act, the letter said, because magazines and books “are fundamental to the ability of citizens to freely express and share their thoughts, ideas, opinions and works of art.” Leaders of Quad and LSC Communications said the proposed merger was essential to their companies’ continued survival. The deal “will strengthen the role of print in an increasingly multichannel media world that is dominated by digital advertising,” said Joel Quadracci, the Quad chief executive. The migration of readers to the internet has led to falling revenues, layoffs and closings at many traditional media companies. Digital advertising has failed to make up for losses in print advertising, with Google and Facebook gobbling up a large share of the revenue generated by online ads.",The New York Times
2019,"2 Giant Buddhas Survived 1,500 Years. Fragments, Graffiti and a Hologram Remain.","Afghanistan Dispatch BAMIYAN, Afghanistan — Here is a reminder to someone with the initials A.B., who on March 8 climbed inside the cliff out of which Bamiyan’s two giant Buddhas were carved 1,500 years ago. In a domed chamber — reached after a trek through a passageway that worms its way up the inside of the cliff face — A.B. inscribed initials and the date, as hundreds of others had in many scripts, then added a little heart. It’s just one of the latest contributions to the destruction of the World Heritage Site of Bamiyan’s famous Buddhas. The worst was the Taliban’s effort in March 2001, when the group blasted away at the two giant statues, one 181 feet and the other 125 feet tall, which at the time were thought to be the two biggest standing Buddhas on the planet. It took the Taliban weeks, using artillery and explosive charges, to reduce the Buddhas to thousands of fragments piled in heaps at the foot of the cliffs, outraging the world. KYRGYZ. uzbek. TAJIK. TURKMEN. BAGHLAN Kabul Bamiyan AFGHANISTAN PAKISTAN Kandahar 200 miles By The New York Times Since then, the degradation has continued, as Afghanistan and the international community have spent 18 years debating what to do to protect or restore the site, with still no final decision and often only one guard on duty. One recent idea came from a wealthy Chinese couple, Janson Hu and Liyan Yu. They financed the creation of a Statue of Liberty-size 3D light projection of an artist’s view of what the larger Buddha, known as Solsol to locals, might have looked like in his prime. The image was beamed into the niche one night in 2015; later the couple donated their $120,000 projector to the culture ministry. The local authorities bring it out on special occasions, but rarely, as Bamiyan has no city power supply, other than fields of low-capacity solar panels. The 3D-image projector is power-hungry and needs its own diesel generator. Most of the time, the remains of the monument are so poorly guarded that anyone can buy a ticket ($4 for foreigners, 60 cents for Afghans), walk in and do pretty much whatever he wants. And many do. Souvenir-hunters pluck pieces of painted stucco decorations from the network of chambers or take away chunks of fallen sandstone. Graffiti signatures, slogans, even solicitations for sex abound. Anyone can, as A.B. did, crawl through the passageways surrounding the towering niches in the cliff, through winding staircases tunneled into the sandstone and up steps with risers double the height of modern ones, as if built for giants. At the end of this journey, you arrive above the eastern niche, which housed the smaller Buddha, and stand on a ledge just behind where the statue’s head once was, taking in the splendid Buddha’s eye view of snow-capped mountains and the lush green valley far below. The soft sandstone of the staircases crumbles underfoot, so that the very act of climbing them is at least in part a guilty pleasure — though no longer very dangerous. Twisted iron banisters set in the stone make the steep inclines and windows over the precipices more safely navigable, if not as authentically first millennium. When the Taliban demolished the Buddhas, in an important sense they botched the job. The Buddhas, built over perhaps a century from 550 A.D. or so, were just the most prominent parts of a complex of hundreds of caves, monasteries and shrines, many of them colorfully decorated by the thousands of monks who meditated and prayed in them. Even without the Buddhas themselves, their niches remain, impressive in their own right; the Statue of Liberty would fit comfortably in the western one. Unesco has declared the whole valley, including the more than half-mile-long cliff and its monasteries, a World Heritage Site. “If the Taliban come back again to destroy it, this time they would have to do the whole cliff,” Aslam Alawi, the local head of the Afghan culture ministry, said. Unesco has also declared the Bamiyan Buddhas complex a “World Heritage Site in Danger,” one of 54 worldwide. The larger western niche is still at risk of collapsing. Most archaeologists oppose restoration, arguing that the damage was too great and that the cost would be prohibitive. Estimates range from $30 million for one Buddha to $1.2 billion for the whole complex. Others argue that the destruction itself has become a historical monument, and that the ruins should be preserved as is, a visible reminder of Taliban iconoclasm. A scientific conference in Tokyo in 2017 — involving Afghans, Unesco, scientists and donors — met to study the matter, and to discuss Afghanistan’s formal request for money to rebuild the eastern Buddha. A diplomatically worded final statement called for more study and an indefinite pause in restoration work. Or, as the Unesco field officer Ghulam Reza Mohammadi in Bamiyan put it, “The Buddhas will never be rebuilt.” The important thing is stabilization and conservation of the remains as they are, Mr. Mohammadi said. “The government can’t even afford to pay for five guards they promised,” he said. No work has been done on the eastern niche since 2013, when a German archaeology team began rebuilding the feet of the smaller Buddha, using new materials and raising an international archaeological hue and cry that brought the work to an abrupt end. Officials say money has run out to work on the western niche, where scaffolding has filled the vast space for at least five years. Mr. Alawi, while in charge for his ministry, does not even have a key to the door blocking a passageway to the top of the western niche; he said a German archaeologist took it with him. Elsewhere on the site, pieces of the Buddhas are in locked cabinets, along with artifacts recovered from the caves, but the Afghans do not have the keys to the locks. A French archaeologist took those, then retired, and has not responded to official requests to return them, Mr. Alawi said. “Somebody buys your dinner, they get to tell you what to eat,” Mr. Alawi said, quoting a Persian saying. Another problem is that no one is really sure a restored Buddha would be safe, given Afghanistan’s continuing war and its government’s declining fortunes. Bamiyan’s governor, M. Tahir Zohair, favors rebuilding the smaller Buddha. But he admitted, “The international community is worried the Taliban might come back and destroy it again.” So that leaves the hologram. After sunset on a recent Monday, Mr. Alawi set up the projector for a demonstration and for 15 minutes filled the deep darkness of the western niche with the huge image of Solsol, left palm forward, visible from across the valley. Arif Taquin, 28, an artist in town, rushed over to the site. “The first time I saw this I cried,” he said. “Every time I see it again I am so moved in new ways, and it is only 3-D. To think we had the real thing, and now it is gone.” When the generator died and the light flickered off, what was left to see in the niche was, as Mr. Taquin put it, “all that ugly scaffolding.” video",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | 2 Questions for Mueller,"letter A reader says Robert Mueller’s testimony next month before Congress gives the former special counsel an opportunity to correct a shortcoming. To the Editor: Re “Mueller to Testify to Congress, Setting Up a Political Spectacle” (front page, June 26): Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, bent over backward to be fair and objective, but because of an overabundance of caution, he fell short of his responsibility. Testifying before Congress will afford him the opportunity to correct that shortcoming. He needs to answer two fundamental questions that will doubtless be asked: Did Donald Trump obstruct or try to obstruct justice? And if so would he, Mr. Mueller, have sought to indict him except for the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president? If he answers in the affirmative, it will probably put an end to the “should Trump be impeached?” agony and allow that process to move forward. Mr. Mueller has strongly implied that impeachment is the appropriate vehicle to determine Mr. Trump’s guilt or innocence. It is time for him to say so. Jay AdolfNew York",The New York Times
2019,2 Rockets Strike Oil Fields in Southern Iraq,"BASRA, Iraq — Two rockets struck separate targets on Wednesday in oil fields just outside Basra, not far from the headquarters of many international and domestic oil companies. Though a bit more frequent in recent weeks, rocket attacks have been rare since the Islamic State was pushed out of Iraq more than 18 months ago, and oil fields generally have not been targets. Basra, in southwestern Iraq just above the Persian Gulf, is one of the richest oil production regions in Iraq. In the first attack, three employees of an Iraqi drilling company who were injured when a Katyusha rocket hit their sleeping quarters were taken to a hospital, said Khalid Hamza, the deputy director of the Basra Oil Company, an Iraqi firm. There were no injuries reported in the second attack. No other details were available about the strike, and officials would not say who they believed was responsible for the attacks. The rocket strikes come as tensions are escalating between the United States and Iran after attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, for which Washington blamed Tehran. Iran said on Monday that it would soon breach curbs on its stock of low-enriched uranium set out in the 2015 pact limiting its nuclear program. In response, President Trump ordered an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East and affirmed his pledge that Iran would not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. The Trump administration withdrew the United States from the nuclear pact last year and has reimposed painful economic sanctions on Iran, including a prohibition on oil exports that has cut off a large portion of its government’s revenue. Western analysts have described the attacks on the oil tankers as an effort by Iran to signal that if it is blocked from selling its oil, it will penalize the rest of the world by making the shipment of oil riskier and more expensive. Recent rocket attacks in Iraq have included one in the Green Zone, home to the embassies of the United States and other countries. Other strikes appeared to take aim at Iraqi security forces. The Iraqi government has been resolute about keeping out of any conflict between Iran and the United States. “We think its an operation that aims to drag Iraq into the crisis between Iran and America and to involve Iraq in a war,” said Gen. Yahya Rasool of the Baghdad Joint Command, which includes American and Iraqi forces. The first rocket landed before dawn Wednesday near the Zubair oil field in an area that includes the headquarters of many oil companies, including those of Shell and Exxon Mobil; the second landed in the area of the Rumaila oil field, one of Iraq’s oldest and largest oil patches, where BP is operating. Shell said in a statement that all its staff members were accounted for and that the company was continuing normal operations in Iraq. Abbas Maher, the mayor of Al Zubair, said the first rocket had been launched from his town. “This is the first incident of its kind, and we consider it as targeting an Iraqi company and damaging the Iraqi economy,” Mr. Maher said.",The New York Times
2019,2 U.S. Soldiers Killed in Fierce Firefight in Afghanistan,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Two United States soldiers were killed during a military operation in Afghanistan on Wednesday, bringing to nine the number of American military fatalities in the country this year. The two, part of a Special Forces team, were killed by small-arms fire in southern Uruzgan province, American defense officials said. The soldiers were engaged in a fierce firefight with Taliban militants, with combatants only yards apart at one point, one of the defense officials said. Earlier Wednesday, Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said the two service members had been killed in eastern Wardak Province. The reason for the difference in the reported location of the battle is unclear. The deaths came just days before the resumption of talks between the Taliban and the United States. The new round is scheduled to start on Saturday in Doha, the Qatari capital. Although the number of American troops in Afghanistan has dropped to about 14,000 — a small fraction of the more than 100,000 at the peak of the war — the American military has taken a more proactive role in helping Afghan forces. The remaining American forces are helping the Afghan military defend its positions and have worked to deplete the Taliban through airstrikes and commando raids, partly to gain leverage at the negotiating table in Doha. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an unannounced visit to Kabul on Tuesday, reiterated that negotiating a political settlement to end the long war is a priority of the Trump administration. “With so much going on in the world right now, it’s sometimes easy to forget about America’s commitment here to Afghanistan, but the world should know that the Trump administration has not forgotten, the American people have not forgotten,” Mr. Pompeo said. “As President Trump has said, the hour has come for peace.” The latest deaths came two months after three American soldiers were killed in an explosion near Bagram Air Base in Parwan Province. And in March, two members of an American special forces unit and four Afghan special forces soldiers were killed during an operation on the outskirts of Kunduz. In 2018, 13 American troops were killed in combat in Afghanistan, up from 11 in 2017.",The New York Times
2019,"2,495 Reports of Police Bias. Not One Was Deemed Valid by the N.Y.P.D.","A city watchdog found that complaints were not taken seriously, and recommended expanding the definition of bias to include racial, ethnic and L.G.B.T.Q. slurs. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] About 2,500 people have lodged formal complaints in the last four and a half years with the New York Police Department, reporting that officers acted with bias toward them. Not a single allegation has been substantiated by the Police Department. In a report issued on Wednesday, a city watchdog agency found the investigations of these complaints against the police lacking, and recommended changes to how the department classifies and handles bias allegations. Often, allegations were listed as unsubstantiated or unfounded, and closed, according to the report by the city’s Department of Investigation. In some cases officers misclassified complaints or failed to interview people involved. The report also concluded that police officials did not take bias allegations as seriously as they do other kinds of police misconduct. “Establishing effective and fair processes for the investigation of biased policing allegations is a fundamental component of the Police Department’s relationship with the public, helping to build trust and confidence,” Margaret Garnett, the D.O.I. commissioner, said in a statement. In 2014, the Police Department created a way for residents to report incidents of bias by officers as a separate class of complaints and started investigating them. At the time, senior commanders were wrestling with the fallout over the department’s “stop-and-frisk” policy, under which thousands of mostly black and Hispanic men were searched on what a federal judge determined were questionable constitutional grounds. The intent was to give city residents a direct way to make complaints to the police about sensitive issues like racial profiling or the role of prejudice in arrest decisions. In the five years since the program was unveiled, 2,495 complaints have poured in for the department to investigate. But in the report, Philip K. Eure, the city’s inspector general for the Police Department, recommended an overhaul of how the police investigate bias complaints, including better training for officers and more transparency about the allegations. The department currently offers no public accounting of bias incidents or complaints. The police should also redefine what is considered a bias incident, the report said. Under current department policy, the report said, the use of racial, ethnic or L.G.B.T.Q.-based slurs is not considered evidence of bias. Mr. Eure also recommended the department require officers to report incidents of bias involving colleagues. Allegations of police bias are investigated by the department’s Internal Affairs Bureau. The Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that also investigates reports of police misconduct, also refers complaints about biased policing to the Internal Affairs Bureau. The inspector general reviewed 888 bias incidents investigated by the Internal Affairs Bureau and found that 68 percent accused the police of racial bias. In several incidents, the report said, investigating officers failed to pursue the case properly or filed it incorrectly, which hindered the case from being handled appropriately. Often, the report said, officers cited guilty pleas or convictions as evidence that the bias claims were unfounded and simply closed the case. In one complaint, a woman reported that her husband, who is black, was targeted by officers because of his race. The officers boxed in her husband’s car and said his disability placard seemed invalid because he “looked fine,” the report said. The woman said officers then cited her husband for littering after they spotted a discarded cigarette on the sidewalk. Another woman reported that her son was arrested and taken to the police station, where an officer was heard saying, “You know what I do with Gypsies? I put all Gypsies in jail.” Proving that such claims stem from bias is difficult, the inspector general acknowledged, because investigators must demonstrate the officer’s motive was linked to prejudice. Still, the report concluded there is significant room for improvement in the department’s methods. Most critically, the report found, the department does not consider slurs or offensive language to be evidence of “biased policing.” Such incidents are only investigated if the slur is accompanied by another action, like an arrest, use of force or refusing to take a complaint. The report also recommended that the police grant the civilian complaint board the authority to investigate bias complaints that it receives, instead of sending the cases to internal affairs investigators. The department acknowledged in a statement that it could improve, but pointed out that the number of bias incidents being reported by civilians had decreased by a third in the first five months of the year, compared to the same period last year. It also noted that the inspector general had not identified any cases where a complaint should have been substantiated. “Even with the positive changes already made, and the full context of this report, the N.Y.P.D. knows there is more to do,” the Police Department said in a statement. An earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between the New York Police Department and the Civilian Complaint Review Board. The board is an independent agency, not part of the Police Department.",The New York Times
2019,2016 All Over Again,"What many of those in Orlando really wanted to do was relive their historic victory. CreditCreditErin Schaff/The New York Times ORLANDO, Fla. — The crowd in the Amway Center, an arena that seats 20,000, cheered loudly as oversize screens hanging from the ceiling broadcast Fox News projections that Donald J. Trump would win Florida and Ohio — in 2016. Die-hard supporters bussed in from across the state on Tuesday to celebrate the “official” kickoff of Mr. Trump’s 2020 campaign appeared frozen in time, reliving Mr. Trump’s surprise victory over Hillary Clinton. The evening rally, a supersize version of the “Make America Great Again” rallies Mr. Trump has been staging in red states since the beginning of his presidency, was meant to energize the president and consolidate support in a must-win state where Mr. Trump’s numbers are still softer than his advisers would like them to be. But the vibe — the red caps and campaign slogan, a refreshed but familiar playlist featuring “Eye of the Tiger” and “My Way” on loop, an invocation by the megachurch pastor Paula White — was that Mr. Trump and his supporters really wanted to relive their surprise 2016 victory . “2016 was not merely another four-year election,” Mr. Trump said when he took the stage. Pointing to the press pen, he noted that it was “a defining moment in American history, ask them right there.” He followed up with promises to “drain the swamp,” pausing as the crowd picked up the familiar refrain, and assurances that he was going to “build the wall.” He mentioned Hillary Clinton more than half a dozen times before he even acknowledged a single Democratic candidate running for president in 2020. “Do you remember this?” Mr. Trump asked. “They called us deplorables. I think Hillary Clinton made a big mistake with that speech.” Of course, they remembered. They were here to relive it. And so was Mr. Trump’s family as they lined up to warm up the crowd before his arrival. Mr. Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, was the first, reminiscing about the now iconic escalator ride four years ago in Trump Tower when Mr. Trump announced his candidacy. “They thought it was a publicity stunt,” Ms. Trump said of a disdainful news media. “Wasn’t it that much sweeter on Nov. 8, 2016?” Her brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. was more forward-looking, debuting his own nickname for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., “floppy Joe,” and previewing the line of attack the campaign hopes to use against Mr. Biden. “The problem is, you’ve been in government for almost 50 years,” said Mr. Trump, underscoring his father’s status as an outsider, despite occupying the Oval Office. Ivanka Trump, the president’s older daughter, who introduced her father at his announcement four years ago, did not take a speaking role this time around, but was greeted with cheers when her blonde hair became visible near the stage. Aboard Air Force One en route from Washington, there was something of a throwback theme, as well. En route to Florida, Mr. Trump was accompanied by Kellyanne Conway, who served as his final campaign manager in 2016, and who is not part of his regular traveling entourage. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s departing press secretary who has been with Mr. Trump since his last campaign, wrote wistfully on Twitter that this was to be her final flight with the president. Mr. Trump, for his part, surrounded by his family and the aides who were with him on his first improbable run, seemed ready to run the same campaign all over again. He ended telling the crowd that the themes of his campaign had not shifted, and that the country was still in a dark place and in need of change. “Together we will make America wealthy again,” he said. “We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again.” transcript Whether the message will have the same effect as it did four years ago — when Mr. Trump’s reading the room and responding to the crowd was a novel and mesmerizing act — is an open question. Unlike last time, some of his most avid supporters seemed to have exhausted themselves before the end of the show. By the end of Mr. Trump’s 76-minute speech, there were patches of blue seats visible across the arena. Some supporters had left the rally early, maybe because they had seen it before.",The New York Times
2019,"2019 Belmont Stakes: Sir Winston, the ‘Wrong’ Horse, Prevails","Sometimes you can win and lose a race at the same time. Horse players have long known this: Many “Dutch” their races, betting two horses to win. Horse trainers, too, as Mark Casse demonstrated as a 10-horse field turned for home in the 151st running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. Many had never heard of the Indiana-born, Canada-famous Casse. But he had emerged as a key figure in this topsy-turvy Triple Crown season. Five weeks ago, his colt War of Will nearly went to his knees in the Kentucky Derby. He got tangled with the apparent victor, Maximum Security, who had jumped a puddle, veered right and subsequently was disqualified for interfering with his rivals, giving the win to Country House. Casse, 58, knows what he is doing. He has had horses in plenty of big races and is a member of Canada’s racing Hall of Fame and a multiple Sovereign Award winner for outstanding trainer in that country. Two weeks after the Derby controversy, horse enthusiasts and casual fans got to know Casse a whole lot better when War of Will burst up the rail in the Preakness Stakes to give Casse and his young rider, Tyler Gaffalione, their first victories in a Triple Crown race. And as the horses turned for home on Saturday in this grueling mile-and-a-half marathon nicknamed the Test of the Champion, War of Will was rolling and looked as if he was going to become the first horse to fail to win the Derby but complete a Preakness-Belmont double since Afleet Alex in 2005. As those in the crowd of 56,217 at Belmont Park who were clutching betting tickets on War of Will rose to their tiptoes, Casse knew better. He did what Dutch bettors do: He switched horses. “I went to riding Sir Winston,” Casse said, an embarrassed smile creasing the corners of his mouth. Big-time trainers often have more than one horse in the biggest races. Casse is reaching that level and he had a second horse in the Belmont, a colt by the name of Sir Winston who had not won since December in Canada and had arrived here last month. Sir Winston took to this grand old racetrack famed for its big, sweeping turns and a surface that is known as Big Sandy because its footing is more Jersey Shore than Kentucky topsoil. “I said all week he was doing well,” Casse said, that grin growing bigger. In May at Belmont, Sir Winston had erased a 10-length deficit and rumbled home with a rush to finish second in the Peter Pan Stakes. As the horses rounded the far turn on Saturday, Casse knew War of Will, the only horse to compete in all three legs of the Triple Crown, was done. “I could see where War of Will was struggling a little,” he said. “He looked like maybe he was a little flat.” But behind War of Will, the jockey Joel Rosario had Sir Winston cruising around the turn as if the colt were tethered to a slingshot. “I saw Joel cut the corner a little bit,” Casse said. Now Casse’s eyes were locked on Sir Winston. The wrong horse was now his right horse. Rosario knew it, too. He had tucked the son of Awesome Again on the rail and said he was genuinely surprised the colt was comfortable. “He didn’t mind the inside,” Rosario said. So Rosario vowed to take his time. Ahead of them, the 21-1 long shot Joevia was winging the field through a half mile of 48.79 seconds. He ripped a mile in 1:38.27, and Rosario and Sir Winston were in hot pursuit. “He was a little closer,” than Rosario wanted him. When Joevia led the field into the stretch, his trainer, Gregory Sacco, felt his temples pounding: Could his colt really win? “I think my blood pressure went through the roof,” he said. Behind him was Tacitus, the striking gray colt that went off as the nearly 2-1 favorite. But he was too wide and too far back. “We did have a bit of a wide trip, which you never like,” said the trainer of Tacitus, the Hall of Famer Bill Mott, who also trains Country House. Rosario, meanwhile, wrangled Sir Winston to the middle of the track and then back inside, passing Joevia at the top of the stretch and holding off Tacitus for an emphatic victory by a length in 2:28.30 Joevia was third, less than another length behind, and War of Will finished ninth. Not only did Casse have his second straight Triple Crown victory, Sir Winston’s owner, Tracy Farmer, took home a $900,000 first-place check and bettors were rewarded with a $22.40 payoff on a $2 wager. The victory by Sir Winston ended a strange Triple Crown season, kicking off with the confusing, disputed disqualification of Maximum Security, which led to the horse’s owners filing a federal lawsuit seeking to restore their colt’s Derby victory. And at the Preakness, a horse crossed the finish line after shedding the jockey out of the gate. Then there are the dead horses — 27 of them since December at Santa Anita Park in California, which have prompted an investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office and calls from elected officials and animal-rights activists for the track to be shut down. Now Sir Winston joins Maximum Security, who is recovering at Monmouth Park on the Jersey Shore; Country House, who is recovering from an infection; and War of Will as the top 3-year-olds in the nation. Some or all could face one another over the summer in the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth or Jim Dandy and Travers Stakes at Saratoga. No matter the distractions, Casse has established himself as a horseman to be reckoned with on this side of the Canadian border as well. It’s a small fraternity of top-flight trainers who can win with the wrong horse.",The New York Times
2019,"Scoring Early and Late, Liverpool Wins Sixth Champions League Title","Champions League final: Liverpool 2, Tottenham 0 Overcoming Tottenham in Madrid, Jürgen Klopp and Liverpool claim the prize they had coveted for so long. MADRID — There was a moment, as most of Liverpool’s players drew themselves up in line in the middle of the field, ready to offer a guard of honor to Tottenham Hotspur, when Trent Alexander-Arnold was far away, all by himself, in a world all of his own. [Sign up for Rory Smith’s weekly newsletter on world soccer: Rory Smith on Soccer.] In front of him was a massed bank of red: Liverpool’s fans stretching forward, pouring over each other, clawing at the air, desperate to be as close as possible to the players that had beaten Tottenham, 2-0, the goals coming early and late, and made their team champion of Europe for the sixth time. Alexander-Arnold is one of them, really, deep down. He grew up in Liverpool, supporting the club, a few miles from Anfield, the team’s famed home. His jubilation was their jubilation. His dream was their dream. There were thousands of eyes upon him, but it felt, still, like a private reverie. And so, without thinking, Alexander-Arnold started to dance: bouncing up and down, kicking his legs and pumping his fists to a rhythm only he could hear, and then running the width of the field and back again, the energy burning away inside him. Only once that was done did he sprint back to his teammates, to join the line that would applaud the Spurs players as they trudged onto the podium to collect their runner-up medals, those tokens of regret. Only then did Alexander-Arnold make the slow walk himself, those few seconds that he will remember for the rest of his life. First, though, he had wanted to commune with his fans, his people. Sometimes, you want to be with your own. Even amid the tumult of a Champions League final, even in all the delirium for Liverpool and its fans and the despair etched on the faces of Tottenham’s players, it is worth pausing to consider Alexander-Arnold’s career, because it is the best way to understand how it is that Liverpool now stand as winners of the Champions League. Alexander-Arnold is only 20. It was only a little more than two years ago that he made his first start in the Premier League, a surprise selection for a game against Manchester United. As ever, youth was given its chance by dearth; Liverpool’s season was hardly memorable: a fourth-place finish qualifying as the meeting of a target, rather than a great triumph. By the start of the next season, he was Jürgen Klopp’s first choice right back. Again, necessity was the midwife to invention. Nathaniel Clyne, the senior choice for the position, had an injury. Alexander-Arnold stepped in, presumably on a temporary basis. That was the summer of 2017. The trajectory of his career since — the trajectory of Liverpool’s rise — is quite extraordinary. Alexander-Arnold ended that season as a Champions League finalist, sprawled on the field in Kiev, ruing Liverpool’s defeat to Real Madrid. He went to the World Cup with England, helped Liverpool mount a thrilling title challenge, and then — at the end of only his second full season as a senior player — went back to the Champions League final. And this time, thanks to an early, controversial penalty from Mohamed Salah and a late, trophy-clinching, nerve-settling goal from Divock Origi, he ended it not just on his feet, but dancing. It has, by any measure, been an extraordinary rise, both in gradient and speed. But then so too has Liverpool’s: a team that had barely even qualified for the Champions League since 2010 — just one, faintly embarrassing campaign in 2014 — has now reached two finals in two years, and won one of them. Only Real Madrid and A.C. Milan have a more garlanded European history than Liverpool, a better record in the game’s biggest club competition. Liverpool’s players know precisely who to thank for that. After the medals had been handed out in Madrid’s Estadio Metropolitano, after the trophy had been lifted and the glitter cannons exploded and the fireworks illuminated the night sky, after the players had celebrated with the fans, just as things were winding down, Georginio Wijnaldum noticed someone was missing. Klopp was sneaking away, back toward the center circle. Wijnaldum chased after him, together with Virgil van Dijk, and hauled him back. The rest of the team closed in. They picked up their manager, hoisted him on their shoulders, and marched him back to the fans. Once there, they bounced him up and down — no easy task; he’s a big man — as a broad grin spread across his face. Klopp had, for some reason, picked up a reputation as a nearly man: a manager who could take a team so far, but was destined to fail at the last hurdle. The fact he had won two German championships, and a German Cup, did not seem to count. He lost a Europa League final with Liverpool. He lost a League Cup final with Liverpool. He lost a Champions League final with Liverpool. He was unlucky; it had been decreed. That would have been the story had Liverpool lost, of course, as it might well have done: for all the drama of this Champions League season, this was an anti-climactic final. Salah’s penalty — after a harsh handball decision against Moussa Sissoko in the match’s first minute — seemed to set the nerves on edge, and sap the noise from the crowd. Liverpool was careless, disjointed; Spurs, slowly and surely, started to assert themselves. As the clock ticked, Liverpool’s lead looked fragile. Alisson Becker, the club’s goalkeeper, had to make a string of saves, a one-man resistance against a white tide. Klopp’s curse seemed to be coming back, yet further proof that he lacked some crucial ingredient that would make him a winner. And then the goal came: for all the Spurs pressure, Liverpool scored it. Klopp would have his trophy. He would break the curse that had never been a curse. That does not diminish the work Mauricio Pochettino has done at Spurs, of course: the fact that Spurs was here at all ranks as one of the most remarkable managerial feats of recent years. So, too, defeat for Liverpool should not have been allowed to disguise all that Klopp has done, the transformation he has overseen: taking a club that had started to drift, that had lost its sense of purpose a little, and turning it back into a genuine force in England, and in Europe. Alexander-Arnold, the player who ends his seasons in Champions League finals, is not the only story that illustrates the seismic change in the club’s fortunes. Andy Robertson joined Liverpool in the summer of 2017, too. He has never lost a home game for the club. Divock Origi might have been loaned out to Huddersfield Town last summer; he now has scored a decisive goal in the biggest game in club soccer. That is not to make Liverpool out as some minnow. Klopp had the world’s most expensive defender (van Dijk) in his team, and the second-most expensive goalkeeper in Alisson. The club has spent money, and it has spent money, as a rule, rather well, testament to a recruitment strategy that counts as among the most intelligent in the sport. But Klopp also has maximized his resources: he has helped Alexander-Arnold develop; he has finessed Robertson; he has offered Origi, against all odds, a way back. Most of all, he has helped his team mature. There is an idea, one that will take a while to shift, that Liverpool is a team of adventure and risk and swashbuckling style. It was, certainly, but it has not been for some time. It has become a side that controls games, a team of boundless resilience, that is happy to sacrifice aesthetics for effect. In that sense, this final was fitting tribute. Not, perhaps, to this Champions League season, with all its chaos and drama and logic-defying comebacks, but to this second iteration of Klopp’s Liverpool. This was not a triumph to steal the breath, a rendition of the “heavy metal” soccer that is forever attached, by the tendrils of tired old cliché, to Klopp. Instead, it was a victory for grit and endurance and expertise. It was the victory of seasoned performers, rather than plucky underdogs. There is a myth in sports that nobody remembers who finishes second. It is not true. Spurs fans will remember all that their team has done this season for years, for decades: the chaos against Manchester City, the comeback against Ajax, that moment of pure disbelieving silence after Lucas Moura had carried the team to the Champions League final. The teams Tottenham beat along the way, and those who watched, will remember, too. Defeat may leave a bitter taste, but in time even that may fade. The journey matters, not only the destination. What nobody remembers, though, is the manner of a victory. What people will remember are the feelings: the ecstasy of a goal, the euphoria of a win, the relief of a final whistle, the bliss of the celebrations that follow. In Liverpool, they will remember that, only a couple of years after they left the wilderness, their team became champion of Europe. They will remember the pride and the pleasure. They will remember reaching out to touch their heroes, desperate to be close to them. They will remember the sight of one of their own, out there on the field, dancing for them, and for himself. Andrew Das and Rory Smith of The Times tracked the match as it happened: Pandemonium on the field, and joy after last season’s disappointment. The Origi goal had set the Liverpool fans off into a lusty version of “Allez Allez Allez,” the converted Italian disco hit that has been their soundtrack for a year. It was a welcome release for these fans, some of whom had surely traveled and watched their team fall to Real Madrid in last season’s final in Kiev. But almost as soon as the final whistle blew, and after the players and coaching staff poured onto the field, the supporters shifted to a more familiar standard, “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” the anthem they have sung since the club’s glory days in the 1970s and ’80s. Liverpool won the European Cup quite often back then, claiming the giant trophy in 1977, ’78, ’81 and ’84. But it had to wait until 2005, and a miraculous comeback against Milan in Istanbul, to lift it again, and it had failed twice — in 2007 and last year — before Saturday’s celebrations brought back all those warm feelings once again. Liverpool fans sing “Allez Allez Allez,” the Italian disco hit they modified for last season’s run to the final. They lost that day to Real Madrid, but this time the singing will continue long into the night here. Everyone got lulled to sleep again and Origi banged in the clincher. He’s got the knack for late drama, and this time he collected a ball after an attack had seemed to falter, controlled it and fired a left-footed shot around Lloris and inside the left post. Liverpool 2, Tottenham 0. It’s all over but the singing now. He dives left to parry away Ericksen’s curler, a terrific save for a terrific shot. The corner looks dangerous ... until Liverpool’s back line pulls up and leaves Son and others well offside. Danger averted. Rose came for a ball and fell theatrically after Milner challenged for the ball. But the referee has not been swayed, and neither has the replay official. The foul was outside the area. Ericksen will take the free kick, just outside the corner on the left ..... Sort of a like for like there, in that both are attackers. Except that Dele is better. But Llorente is at least fresh, and in this heat, Tottenham could use that for the final 10 minutes. Nothing to lose now. That’s why they spent all that money to buy the big Brazilian goalkeeper from Roma: He stopped Son, who just keeps getting free for shots, and then a second attempt by Lucas Moura. First the Dutch defender chases down Son and breaks up a shot at the last moment, then he clears a cross by Kane that could have been trouble. Liverpool spent a ton of money on van Dijk (and Alisson, the goalkeeper behind him), and these final 20 minutes can make it all worth it. The little-used (at least lately) Dier comes on for Sissoko, who provided the pivotal moment of this match with his handball before he’d even broken a sweat in the first half. The night will be a disappointment for him, that one (monumental) error overshadowing a solid job well done. Tottenham pings one cross, then another, across the full width of the Liverpool penalty area, but each sails through cleanly — and untouched. Trippier gets a third, but Liverpool clears that one and breaks out. Only a late-arriving Tottenham foot at the other end thwarts the counterattack. A probing, dangerous run by Mané ends with the ball set on a tee for Milner, and he rips it ... just wide of Lloris’s near post. You could hear the “ooooooohs” from here. The hero of Amsterdam comes on, and they’ll need the same kind of late magic tonight. Winks did his job. Tottenham just doesn’t need that job done right now. Lucas Moura offers the prospect of goals, or at least enough of a threat of them that Ericksen and Son and Kane and Dele Alli may get a little more room to work. That’s Klopp opting for leadership and experience over the potential for Wijnaldum to do something flashy. He needs more of the former now, not the latter. That may have been planned — Firmino has been out with a groin injury — but it also could be a reflection of the fact that Firmino has been a ghost today. Origi, a young Belgian striker, has a knack for opportunistic goals. And late goals. But he’s also an imposing physical presence in ways that the smaller Sané and Salah are not. Oh, and James Milner is getting instructions, so expect him to come on next. He was clearly fouled by Alexander-Arnold as he cut back in on the left wing, but there’s no call. So he stays down to make the referee come over and check on him. “No call? O.K., then let’s see you do some running, buddy.” That’s better. Liverpool strokes the ball around the outside as Spurs collapses into its area, and Robertson’s teasing cross is nearly met by Mané. But Lloris smothers the trouble, and Spurs break out looking for Kane almost immediately. That’s not really what Klopp wants to see. Vertonghen fires a shot after a free kick but has two problems with his appeal for handball: 1. It hit the Liverpool defender in the backside, and 2. Tottenham was offside on the initial free kick. No subs for either side, but remember: It’s a hot night, so expect some sooner rather than later. If there is a note of optimism to be struck after that cautious, sloppy, largely forgettable 45 minutes, it is that, for most of this season, the Champions League’s drama has come late. It likes to build to its climaxes. Spurs will have to pour forward; Liverpool will be asked more questions; there will be space on the counter. It could yet turn into a fitting final for the season that it concludes. Whether it is may rest on whether this game follows the pattern of most meetings between these teams: At some point, Mauricio Pochettino will change his approach; the challenge for Jürgen Klopp is to see it, and adapt to it, as quickly as possible. If not — as happened at Anfield only a couple of months ago — then Spurs may seize control. The complicating factor is that, well, Spurs may think it already is in control. That first 25 seconds aside, Spurs has looked by far the more accomplished in possession. True, thus far it has only created a couple of half-glimpses of goal: Christian Eriksen had the best of them, right at the end of the first half. But Pochettino will have seen enough to think that, with a little more precision, his approach could yet bear fruit. If not, expect him to go more direct, perhaps through the introduction of Lucas Moura, who has the pace to trouble Liverpool in myriad ways. As for Liverpool: It is worth noting that both of these teams are subject to stereotypes that are a little outdated. Spurs does not press quite as hard as it did a couple of years ago; Pochettino has refined his approach a little more. Liverpool has a reputation for adventure, for swash and buckle, but those performances have been much rarer this year. For the most part, it has built its season on defensive resilience, on game management. This will be a test of how well it has learned those lessons. For a match that started with a shocking penalty after only 30 seconds, there weren’t a ton of chances. Harry Kane, back in the Spurs team for the first time in 53 days, has had little service and even less impact on the game. (The same could be said for Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino, who is actually playing in this game if you’ve forgotten about him.) Liverpool grabbed that early lead, but it has been a little sloppy at times. A lead is a lead, though, and better to have one than not. The good news for Spurs is that Kane doesn’t need a lot of chances. He’s the kind of player who can get only one and bury it. He tried to lead Son in on Alisson, but his touch was too heavy, and the chance vanished. One has to think both teams just want to get a drink and break and a rethink now. And remember this paragraph from Rory’s “Why Tottenham will win” piece today: Spurs and Liverpool’s meetings tend to share a pattern. At some point, Pochettino will tweak something, do something unexpected, and as a rule, Liverpool will struggle to react. Halftime definitely will be a good time for another one of those tweaks. Liverpool is leaning on Spurs a bit more now. Tottenham clears the first but only gives up another. Salah wastes it by hitting the first man. Joel Matip springs Robertson down the left with a quick-thinking pass and Robertson, driving forward and seeing no options, rockets a shot from outside the area. Lloris tips it over, though, and Spurs clear the corner. But now Vertonghen is down; he injured his left elbow in the jostling inside there. Doesn’t look terribly hurt. Maybe just a ding on the funny bone? Both teams have calmed down, but Tottenham, to its credit, has looked a bit dangerous at times through Son’s runs and Eriksen’s work in tight spaces. One can only hope a first-minute penalty doesn’t decide this. In an age of security and terror fears, it’s really stunning that this continues to happen at major sporting events. This time the fan got all the way into the center circle. The penalty got the match off to a rollicking start and had the Liverpool fans singing at full voice, but everyone seems to have dialed things back now, perhaps aware that a frantic pace is probably not wise on this sweltering night. The game could not have started worse for Pochettino and Spurs: All that work, all that planning, to give up a penalty after 30 seconds. They’ll be looking for some position now, to get their footing and get back into this. Mo Salah buries the penalty past Lloris, who had no chance. The penalty was a handball on Sissoko, who inexplicably had his right arm out on a Mané cross. What a disastrous start for Spurs. Rory Smith: I wish I had some strong opinion on whether that was a penalty or not, but to be honest the rules now seem to vary so much between the Premier League and UEFA competitions, and the definitions are so sketchy and subjective, I’m honestly not sure. I can understand why Spurs are baffled, I can understand why Damir Skomina, the referee, gave it. It would be unsatisfactory, though, if that proved decisive. The referee, Damir Skomina of Slovenia, whistles a penalty against Tottenham after less than 30 seconds!!! The teams are on the field and are holding a moment of remembrance for the Spain and Arsenal player Jose Antonio Reyes, who died in a car accident today. As is customary, it is applause, not silence. Rory checks in from the Wanda Metropolitano: The scale of the Champions League final seems to grow every year: Strange as it is to say, it isn’t that long since this game was not always necessarily a sellout. Now it takes over an entire city: Madrid has been awash with Liverpool and Spurs fans since Wednesday; roads have been closed and hotels requisitioned and sun-bleached plazas staked out. In fact, it’s not just the fans of the two clubs. One of the best things about the Champions League final is the vast assortment of fans who travel just to be here: You see Argentine and Brazilian club jerseys — there must be dozens of Flamengo fans here — and always, always a contingent of fans, clad in emerald green, representing Mexico. Then there are the vanquished and the disappointed: the fans of those clubs who thought they might make it and never did. Normally that means Bayern Munich, but this year there are a number of Ajax fans, here to sample the occasion, and possibly to sell their tickets. It feels as if Liverpool is, perhaps, better represented — both in the stadium and in the city as a whole — but the difference in noise is likely to be marginal. One bank of the Estadio Metropolitano has been given over entirely to Tottenham, another to Liverpool. Neither team will be short of support. Spurs fans would have been cheered to see Harry Kane (and, less headline-grabbing but almost as significant, Harry Winks) in Mauricio Pochettino’s team. That was the only really difficult selection decision either manager had to make: whether Kane, who has not played for almost two months, could be drafted straight into action. Clearly, the idea of leaving him out was unimaginable for Pochettino. It is unfortunate that Lucas Moura, the player whose goals against Ajax brought Spurs here, misses out, but this feels like Tottenham’s strongest team. Now that we have an answer to the first Kane dilemma, the question shifts to how long he can last, particularly in the sweltering heat. It has been blistering in Madrid today, and it will be hot, and close, on the field. That will be a challenge for everyone, not only Kane. Liverpool’s lineup (4-3-3) is out: Alisson; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joel Matip, Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson; Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum; Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané Substitutes: Mignolet, Lovren, Milner, Gomez, Sturridge, Moreno, Lallana, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Shaqiri, Brewster, Origi, Kelleher. Analysis: No surprises here. Firmino had been dealing with a groin problem but Klopp declared him fit and ready to go this week. Tottenham’s lineup (4-2-3-1) is out: Hugo Lloris; Kieran Trippier, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen, Danny Rose; Harry Winks, Moussa Sissoko; Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli, Son Heung-min; Harry Kane Substitutes: Gazzaniga, Vorm, Sanchez, Foyth, Davies, Aurier, Dier, Walker-Peters, Wanyama, Lucas, Lamela, Llorente Analysis: Kane has not played since April 9, and Pochettino was coy about his inclusion right up until Friday’s prematch news conference, when he said, “We have one training session and then we are ready to decide.” But no one really expected Kane to miss this one. Rory Smith makes the case for the Reds: Jürgen Klopp does not feel cursed. He does not, as he made plain during his Friday evening news media call in Madrid, even feel unlucky. He might have lost every final he has reached with Liverpool, and six of the seven he has contested over all, but he does not see that as a harbinger. The reason for that, put simply, is that this is the possibly the first time — and certainly the first time with Liverpool — that he has gone into a final in charge of the favorite. The bald fact of the Premier League table illustrates that Liverpool has been significantly more consistent than Tottenham this season: Klopp’s team eventually finished 26 points ahead of Spurs. Throw in that Liverpool had England’s best defense and two of its three top scorers, and then add that it went through the pomp, circumstance and attendant emotional sweep of a Champions League final 12 months ago, and Liverpool’s quiet, unassuming confidence is understandable. For Klopp, unlike his Spurs counterpart, Mauricio Pochettino, there are no selection dilemmas or tactical alternatives: He, his players and his opponents all know how Liverpool will try to play. Klopp rarely changes; he is not the sort of manager to try to spring a surprise. This season, he has not needed to. For the most part, what Liverpool does works: Even Barcelona, even with a 3-0 lead, even with Lionel Messi, could not resist. Klopp will feel that if his players do not freeze, if there are no individual mistakes or moments of inspiration from Tottenham, Liverpool is strong enough to overcome Spurs, and finally see off even the mention of a curse. Rory Smith makes the case for Spurs: It is the nature of a single, winner-takes-all game that every advantage can, in a different light, start to look like a disadvantage. Mauricio Pochettino and Spurs do have choices to make: Do they play with a three-man defense or a four-man back line? Does Harry Kane start, or is he best used from the bench? If he does, who joins him? From one angle, it looks like uncertainty; from another, it looks like unpredictability Though Klopp’s record against Pochettino is good — one defeat in nine games — Spurs and Liverpool’s meetings tend to share a pattern. At some point, Pochettino will tweak something, do something unexpected, and as a rule, Liverpool will struggle to react. That happened, certainly, in the last encounter, which Liverpool won by 2-1, but only thanks to a Hugo Lloris mistake and a Moussa Sissoko miss. Spurs dominated for long stretches at Anfield. That will give Pochettino’s team hope. Not that hope is in short supply. There is a weightlessness about Spurs, thanks, in part, to the chaos and wonder of the team’s run to its first European final in 35 years — the comeback in Amsterdam, the heart-stopping drama of the quarterfinal with Manchester City, even the fact that, after only three group games, the team seemed likely to be eliminated. By meeting every challenge, by surviving every scare, Tottenham has cultivated an air of invincibility. Destiny, Pochettino might call it. Partly, though, it is because Spurs is not expected to be here. Liverpool has the pressure of its failure in the league and its defeat in Kiev; Spurs has only the opportunity to become the least likely champion of Europe since — probably — Liverpool in 2005. Over a season, it has been unable to compete. Over 90 minutes, there is little between the two teams. Spurs only needs a little luck, a little belief, a little something. It has had that in spades in this tournament so far. Rory went to Spain’s Costa del Sol — yes, tough duty, but he was surprisingly amenable to the request; go figure — to find out. Here’s a little of what he discovered: “Some Liverpool players found it was in the evening when their minds tended to wander. It was then, once the children were in bed or training was done, that their thoughts would drift to the Champions League: back to Kiev, forward to Madrid, lingering on what might have been, and what could yet be. Others were caught when they were most vulnerable: as they went to sleep, or as they woke up, those moments either side of consciousness, when you cannot help yourself. For them, as one member of Jürgen Klopp’s squad puts it, Saturday’s final against Tottenham has been ‘the last thing you think about at night and the first thing you think about in the morning.’” Read his full piece here. It’s an interesting question, and Rory explored the idea a bit the other day. For years, clubs looked to Asia for players who could move shirts, attract sponsors or offer valuable, high-workrate minutes. But stereotypes about Asian players sell many of them — and Son especially — short. As Rory wrote: “It was not until this season — and, in reality, until those few weeks recently when he went supernova — that England, and Europe, started to afford Son the star treatment: the forward whose absence is worth fretting about, the player who might lead his team to the Champions League title, the subject of countless long-form profiles in half a dozen languages. A few days before the game against Liverpool in which he might cement his place as a global superstar, it is worth asking why.” Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp and Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino are both respected coaches with résumés that would be the envy of most managers. But neither has won a piece of European silverware — Klopp has lost twice in the Champions League final, and Pochettino has never lifted a trophy of any kind since becoming a head coach — and so their legacies have been a topic of discussion since the final’s matchup was set. The good news is that one will shed that label of great-coach-who-couldn’t-win-trophies on Saturday. The bad news is that, for the other man, the stigma will continue. But Pochettino pointed out, correctly, on Friday that the result of any single match — even a big one for which a coach and his staff have had three weeks to prepare — isn’t always in the manager’s control. “People talk about lost finals,” Pochettino said Friday. “The most difficult thing is arriving in finals. And when you arrive, there is a lot of things you can’t control.” The idea of the European Cup, when it was created in 1955, was to bring together soccer champions from across the continent to decide which country truly had the best team. Was Real Madrid better than A.C. Milan? Could Manchester United beat Benfica? Could Ajax beat Juventus? But lately the same small clique of big clubs has tended to dominate: Victor Mather of The Times explored the evolution of the tournament once this year’s final was set, and Tariq Panja has chronicled efforts to make that a feature, not a bug. Liverpool, which lost to Real Madrid in last year’s final, is seeking its sixth Champions League title. It last won the trophy in 2005, adding it to titles claimed in 1977, ’78, ’81 and ’84. (The games were less commercial but absolutely no less festive back then.) Liverpool has also lost three European Cup finals, in 1985, 2007 and last year’s in Kiev against Real Madrid. Tottenham is playing in the Champions League final for the first time. Its most recent European trophy was the 1984 UEFA Cup, won when it beat Anderlecht. This is the first all-Premier League final since Manchester United beat Chelsea on penalties in Moscow in 2008. That matchup was more than a decade ago, but single-country finals are no longer rare: The Spanish city rivals Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid have met in two recent finals (2014 and 2016), and Liverpool’s manager, Jürgen Klopp, was the coach at Dortmund when it fell to Bayern Munich in the 2013 final at Wembley. This is the fifth Champions League final in Madrid but the first at Atlético’s Wanda Metropolitano stadium, which opened in 2017.",The New York Times
2019,2019 French Open: Barty and Vondrousova Make the Women’s Final,"PARIS — Under mostly cooperative gray skies and in front of small but enthusiastic crowds at Roland Garros’s secondary stadiums on Friday, Ashleigh Barty and Marketa Vondrousova booked spots in the French Open final, surviving blustery switches in momentum and winds. Vondrousova, 19, lost the first 10 points of her match against 26th-seeded Johanna Konta of Britain before steadying herself and finding her range, breaking late in both sets to claim a 7-5, 7-6 (2) win. The match was played at a new 5,000-seat stadium, Simonne Mathieu Court, the smallest site for a Grand Slam singles semifinal in decades. Six minutes later, the eighth-seeded Barty of Australia recovered from an early collapse to finish off her semifinal against the American Amanda Anisimova, winning, 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-3, at 10,068-seat Suzanne Lenglen Court. Both women’s semifinals had been scheduled for Thursday on Philippe Chatrier Court, which seats 15,500, but were postponed by weather. [Read more about Rafael Nadal’s victory over Roger Federer in the men’s semifinals.] Anisimova, 17, had trailed by 0-5, 15-40 in the first set before suddenly surging, reeling off 16 straight points that left Barty, 23, staring down a deficit of a set and 0-3 midway through the second set. Told by the on-court interviewer that she would remember the match forever, Barty expressed the residual whiplash she still felt from the herky-jerky ride. “Both good and bad memories,” she said. “That was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.” Though she had no clay-court pedigree before this season, Barty has made the transition from her Miami Open title on hardcourts in March look seamless. Her kick serve and her topspin forehand bounce high, and her slice dies short, a combination that has caused discombobulating distress to opponent after opponent in Paris. Though she had a 2-5 record at Roland Garros before this year, Barty will go into Saturday’s final as a favorite against the 38th-ranked Vondrousova, an unseeded left-hander from the Czech Republic. Barty won their two previous matches, on grass in Birmingham, England, in 2017, and on hardcourts in Cincinnati last year. Vondrousova also had never made it past the second round in two previous runs at Roland Garros, but she has been one of the top players on tour in recent months, with a 28-5 record since February, which is the tour’s best. Born in Sokolov, a small western Czech town near the German border, Vondrousova learned tennis from a coach with a fondness for drop shots. The shot has become her signature, and yet another drop-shot winner sealed the win over Konta. “It’s my thing,” Vondrousova said of the fitting finish. “So I’m just very happy.” Barty, 23, had her own breakthrough as a teenager, winning the junior Wimbledon title at 15 and reaching three Grand Slam doubles finals in 2013. But she found the expectations placed on her at a young age overwhelming and retreated from the sport for nearly two years, putting down her rackets and taking up professional cricket. [Read more about Ashleigh Barty’s professional cricket career.] In her return to tennis, Barty has framed her elite singles play as a team effort, which includes her coach, Craig Tyzzer, and others. “It’s been an incredible journey the last three years; it’s been an incredible journey the last two weeks,” Barty said. “I feel like I have played some really good tennis, some consistent tennis. Although that level wasn’t there today for the whole match necessarily, it was there when I needed it.” An ominous weather forecast and presold tickets for two men’s semifinals sessions on the tournament’s primary stadium, Philippe Chatrier Court, left the women’s semifinalists to play at places and at times that are rarely used to showcase such major matches. The match between Konta and Vondrousova started with about 1,500 people watching, an audience that would not be large for a first-round match at Roland Garros, much less a semifinal. Vondrousova’s first match on the Chatrier Court in this tournament will be the final, though she said that as a junior she had watched her countrywoman Lucie Safarova play the 2015 final there. In a news conference on Wednesday, the French Open’s tournament director, Guy Forget, suggested that because some WTA events had similarly sized main stadiums, the women would not feel out of place competing in a 5,000-seat site. Once the schedule was made on Thursday evening, the WTA chief executive, Steve Simon, called it “unfair and inappropriate,” saying one of the semifinals could have preceded the men’s match on Chatrier. Roger Federer, who, like all of the men’s semifinalists, played his match Friday on Chatrier, expressed sympathy with the WTA’s complaints. “You make it all the way to a semis and you get put on the third-biggest court at 11?” Federer said. “It’s a tough one.” Konta was measured when asked about the court assignments, saying of the underwhelming atmosphere on Mathieu, “The way it looks probably speaks for itself.” But after she got a sixth question about the scheduling in her postmatch news conference — this one mentioning that the former French star Amélie Mauresmo had called the decision a “disgrace” — a worn-down Konta said that what was more unfortunate was that women “have to justify their scheduling or their involvement in an event or their salary or their opportunities.” She added: “I don’t want to sit here and justify where I’m scheduled. That’s not my job. My job is to come here and entertain people, and I feel I did that. And I feel I gave people who paid tickets every opportunity to enjoy their French Open experience. “And if the organizers do not feel that that is something that can be promoted and celebrated, then I think it’s the organizers you need to have a conversation with, not me.”",The New York Times
2019,Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem Complete a Top-Heavy Final Four,"PARIS — In sharp contrast to a women’s singles draw filled with breakthroughs and breakdowns, the final four men in contention at the French Open are a perfectly predictable quartet. In quarterfinal matches that were postponed from Wednesday because of rain, top-ranked Novak Djokovic and fourth-ranked Dominic Thiem won in straight sets on Thursday and joined No. 2 Rafael Nadal and No. 3 Roger Federer in the semifinals. Although those four men have the best clay-court winning percentages of all active players, it is the first time since 2011 that the top four seeds have reached the semifinals at Roland Garros. Even the so-called Big 3 of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic, who have taken turns dominating the tour this decade, have rarely synchronized their successes. Not since the 2012 French Open have they reached this stage at a Grand Slam tournament together. [Read about Amanda Anisimova and Ashleigh Barty reaching the women’s semifinals.] Thiem, 25, who reached his first Grand Slam final last year in Paris and lost in straight sets to Nadal, is well aware of the daunting task at hand for him and others in his generation. He said he saw himself as “in the company with maybe the three best players of all time” in this semifinal slate. “If everything goes quite normal, we have to beat two players with 15 or more Grand Slams,” Thiem said. “So I think everybody can imagine how difficult this is.” With Thursday’s winners set to play again on Friday afternoon — weather permitting — Djokovic and Thiem were efficient and ruthless. Thiem finished first on Suzanne Lenglen Court, needing only 1 hour 47 minutes to dispatch 10th-seeded Karen Khachanov, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2. In a match that lasted 22 minutes longer, Djokovic beat fifth-seeded Alexander Zverev on Philippe Chatrier Court, 7-5, 6-2, 6-2. Djokovic and Thiem will play at Roland Garros for the third time in four years. Thiem won in the 2017 quarterfinals, and Djokovic prevailed in the 2016 semifinals on his way to winning all four Grand Slam titles in a row — a feat he seeks to repeat this weekend. It will be their ninth meeting over all, but that’s still 30 matches short of the Federer-Nadal rivalry that will resume in the preceding semifinal. For a short time on Thursday, it seemed as if Zverev, 22, might crash the top four’s party. The world junior No. 1 when he was 16, Zverev made a breakout run to the semifinals in his hometown tournament in Hamburg, Germany, at 17. After that, headlines in Germany declared him “the next Boris Becker.” But while Becker won his first Wimbledon title at that age, Zverev has been unable to unwrap his gifts on the sport’s biggest occasions. His consistently strong results outside of the majors have kept his ranking high, but it wasn’t until this week, in the fourth round against the ninth-seeded Fabio Fognini, that Zverev notched his first top-25 win at a major. After a disappointing start to this season, Zverev has seemed to play without the usual weight of expectations at this tournament, where he reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event for only the second time. His burden-free ball striking was on display at the onset against Djokovic, the first higher-ranked opponent he had played at a major in nearly three years. Zverev was able to land his punches in the opening games, earning break-point chances in the third and fifth games before capitalizing in the ninth for a 5-4 lead. From there, however, Djokovic dominated, winning 15 of the remaining 19 games. “Really thought that the first set should have gone my way,” Zverev said. “Then played three really bad games from there on. Then once he’s in control, he’s very tough to beat. He’s world No. 1 for a reason.” When he failed to convert two break points in the opening game of the third set, Zverev spiked the racket from his hands. After a badly netted volley in the sixth game of the third set put him down by 2-4, Zverev crouched his long legs low in resignation and stared toward his support team. As the match grew less competitive, the crowd grumbled with apparent dissatisfaction. Zverev contended there was little he could have done to turn it around. “Novak, once he gets up on you, he doesn’t let go,” he said. “What he does on a tennis court, when he’s up in the score, he’s unplayable.” It’s a familiar refrain from an opponent vanquished by these semifinalists. Djokovic, a fixture in late rounds of Grand Slam tournament, said he saw the value of the unexpected semifinalists in the women’s draw. “I think it’s really great for the sport to see new faces,” he said. “I’m sure that people are also excited and looking forward to see some new champions of Grand Slams and big tournaments on the men’s side, as well.” “Hopefully that will come after I finish my career,” he added, laughing.",The New York Times
2019,2019 French Open: Johanna Konta and Marketa Vondrousova Reach Semifinals,"PARIS — On her first four trips to the French Open, Johanna Konta could seemingly do nothing right. This time, she can do no wrong. The 26th-seeded Konta reached the semifinals with a 6-1, 6-4 demolition of the seventh-seeded Sloane Stephens on Tuesday afternoon, taking firm control of the match early in the first set and never relinquishing it. Konta, who reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017, had never won a main-draw match at Roland Garros before this year, falling in the first round four times. With five wins to get to the semifinals, she suddenly has a winning record at the tournament that had been the least successful of her career. Konta, 28, of Britain, will have a chance for a sixth straight victory, and a spot in her first Grand Slam final, when she faces the unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, 19, who prevailed in a topsy-turvy tussle against the 31st-seeded Petra Martic, 7-6 (1), 7-5. It will Vondrousova’s first Grand Slam semifinal. Vondrousova, ranked 38th, was down triple set point at 5-6 in the first set before reeling off 12 of the next 13 points to dig out of the deficit and run away with the ensuing tiebreaker. She then went up by 5-2 in the second set before Martic staged her own comeback, leveling the match before Vondrousova finally claimed the win on her fourth match point. Vondrousova, a left-hander with a whipping forehand and a proclivity for drop shots, will test Konta’s newfound dexterity and comfort on the clay. “There’s things that I do well which are effective against everyone,” Konta said of her next opponent. “It’s just finding that right balance of when I can do that, and when I need to add something else.” There were few adjustments needed for Konta against Stephens on Tuesday. After a competitive first three games, Konta broke for a 3-1 lead in the first set and did not look back. With Stephens down by 1-4, Konta ripped two consecutive return winners to give herself three break points. Stephens, often languid between points, seemed to slow even further, trudging to her service position as if resigned to her fate. She fended off the first two break points, but Konta converted on her third with a forehand cross-court winner. “There is not much you can do when someone is playing like that,” Stephens said. When Stephens held for 1-2 in the second set to end a skid of seven consecutive games, she screamed with catharsis. Konta, who already had beaten Stephens twice this year, was undaunted. She won her first four service games of the second set to love, and her first 18 points on serve over all. Stephens, who used her world-class defense to reach the final at Roland Garros last year, said a lack of clay dust atop the windswept court made it tougher for her to gain a foothold against the Konta onslaught. “Clay is a neutralizer, but there wasn’t very much clay on the court today,” Stephens said. “So that was a little bit tough. She likes to play on hard court and grass, and the court was very fast today, and I think that kind of worked in her favor, obviously. Her serving on a court that was playing a lot different than we had been playing on previously, that was a little bit tricky.” Konta double faulted on her 19th service point of the set, but it proved only a blip. She won the next two points to close out the match in 1 hour 10 minutes, ending on a forehand error by Stephens that Konta confidently circled for an inspection and overrule by the chair umpire Louise Engzell. That sort of confidence, which Konta had shown in becoming a top-five player years ago, had been missing in recent years. Dimitri Zavialoff, who has previously coached Stan Wawrinka and the two-time French Open semifinalist Timea Bacsinszky, has restored Konta’s foundering confidence this year by empowering her to make her own choices. Under Zavialoff, whom she has worked with since October, Konta is having the most successful clay-court campaign of her career, reaching finals in Rabat and Rome before her run in Paris. “He’s been great in just encouraging me, inviting me, and giving me the space to play the way I want to play and not putting too many restraints or restrictions on myself,” Konta said. “I’m just enjoying that almost self-discovery process of being the player who I want to be and trusting the decisions I make out there.” After falling to 50th in the rankings during the past season, Konta is poised to re-enter the top 20. With a title on Saturday, Konta would rejoin the top 10. Showing her comfort level on the surface that requires the most versatility, Konta was able to dominate not just with her offense, but also with counterpunching. After one particularly deep and well hit Stephens forehand in the first game of the second set, Konta hit a looping, high bouncing forehand that kicked off the far baseline and high over Stephens’s head. Stephens leapt for a high backhand stab, but she could barely get her racket on the ball. On break point, Konta rushed Stephens by coming to the net, forcing Stephens to hit a forehand passing shot wide. After the third round, Stephens, the 2017 United States Open champion, was the highest remaining seed in the bottom half of the draw and had been considered the favorite to reach the final. Her exit leaves two Americans — Madison Keys and Amanda Anisimova — in contention for the title. In Wednesday’s quarterfinals, Keys, the No. 14 seed, will take on eighth-seeded Ashleigh Barty of Australia, while 17-year-old Amanda Anisimova will try to upset the defending champion Simona Halep of Romania.",The New York Times
2019,2019 French Open: Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka Lose in the Third Round,"PARIS — Whether you were watching Naomi Osaka lose in the sunshine or watching Serena Williams lose in the shadows, the view of women’s tennis on Saturday at the French Open was the same. This is a wide-open moment in which the outsiders are rightfully brimming with belief; in which superstars exist but genuine dominance does not and in which Osaka, the reigning No. 1, and Williams, the greatest women’s player of this era, can be beaten in straight sets in the third round of a major tournament by unseeded opponents. Osaka was defeated, 6-4, 6-2, by Katerina Siniakova, a Czech with an artisanal service motion who is better known for her doubles prowess. Williams, short on matches but not on stature, was upset by Sofia Kenin, a feisty 20-year-old American, 6-2, 7-5, on the rectangle of clay where she won three French Open singles titles. Kenin was playing in her second French Open; she lost in the first round last year. She was born in Russia to parents who immigrated to the United States with little money. “Try to go to another country with $286,” said Alex Kenin, her father and coach, who added that he and his wife first came to the United States in 1987. His daughter has been watching Williams from afar longer than she can remember, but this was her first chance to face Williams across the net. She rose to the occasion, never looking intimidated, sometimes looking irritated and even repeatedly questioning ball marks in the clay to the point that the crowd at Philippe Chatrier Court turned against her. It would have been no surprise if Kenin had crumpled amid the boos and whistles. Another precocious youngster with no shortage of self-belief, Martina Hingis, did just that 20 years ago when she faced another aging icon, Steffi Graf, and a hostile crowd in the 1999 women’s final at Roland Garros. But Kenin held exceptionally firm, shrugging off the negative energy and focusing on the daunting task at hand to record the most significant victory of her young career. “I didn’t really care,” Kenin said of the boos. “I knew I just had to show the crowd, like, ‘Listen, Sonya Kenin is in the house.’ ” At 5-5 in the second set, the 35th-ranked Kenin broke Williams’s serve with a looping forehand winner. She sat in her chair with ample time to consider the consequences, returned to the baseline and worked her way through a taut final service game. Kenin closed out the upset on her second match point and then dropped her racket and burst into tears as she jogged forward to shake Williams’s hand. “It’s a lot of emotions,” Kenin said as she fought for composure in her on-court interview. “Serena is such a great player and a true champion.” Kenin will next face Ashleigh Barty, the No. 8 seed and one of the few favorites remaining in the draw. Of the 32 seeds, 23 were eliminated or withdrew before the fourth round. Eleven of the top 16 seeds are also out, although last year’s finalists — the champion, Simona Halep, and the runner-up, Sloane Stephens — remain in contention. Osaka, the 21-year-old Japanese star, had won the last two Grand Slam singles titles, fighting off pressure and big-time opposition to win the 2018 United States Open and the 2019 Australian Open. But this was the first time she was the top seed in a Grand Slam tournament. “Usually I find it very freeing and fun,” she said of playing in her sport’s most important events. “This time around, I was kind of tense the entire time.” Williams, 37, also looked edgy from the start of this tournament. She has had a deflating, difficult season as she has struggled to stay healthy. Knee pain, which has troubled her for years, forced her to withdraw from the Miami Open and the Italian Open this season after one round. She arrived in Paris having played just one match in the last two months, and though she worked her way through her first two rounds, she failed to keep pace with Kenin and, in general, bore scant resemblance to the player who has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles. After Williams held in her first two service games, Kenin reeled off seven straight games, as Williams made errors in bunches and Kenin slapped groundstroke winners that Williams often failed to get near, much less counter. “I’m just pretty far away,” Williams said when asked how close she was to optimal conditioning. “The optimistic part is I haven’t been able to be on the court as much as I would have. That’s O.K. At least I can start trying to put the time in now.” Williams, seeded 10th in Paris, has yet to win a tournament since returning to the circuit in March 2018 after giving birth to her daughter, Olympia. With Wimbledon next on her schedule, she said she may consider deviating from her traditional approach and asking for a wild card into a grass-court warm-up event. “I’m definitely feeling short on matches and just getting in the swing of things,” she said. Williams was clearly eager to move on, so eager that she showed up at her postmatch news conference less than 10 minutes after the defeat, which irritated the normally amiable Austrian player Dominic Thiem, who had his own postmatch interview interrupted. “It’s a joke really,” he said. Once in place, Williams was complimentary of Kenin. “I feel like she played really well,” said Williams, who applauded one of Kenin’s winners in the final game of the match. “I feel like she, in that first set in particular, she hit pretty much inches from the line. I haven’t played anyone like that in a long time.” In the day’s other surprising upset, Osaka had the edge in firepower against Siniakova, but Siniakova was far more consistent; she varied her tactics and spins and extended rallies with acrobatic shots but also smacked winners when the openings were there. Above all, the 42nd-ranked Siniakova defended her serve effectively, saving all seven break points she faced, all of which came in the first set. But Saturday’s result was hardly all about Siniakova’s cleverly executed game plan, fighting spirit and world-class backhand. Osaka made 38 unforced errors to Siniakova’s 13. Osaka repeatedly struck the net cord with her huge groundstrokes and service returns. By the end, she was missing by much larger margins, as Siniakova reeled off the last five games to put herself in the fourth round of a Grand Slam singles tournament for the first time. But Siniakova, the daughter of a Russian father and Czech mother, is no stranger to success at Roland Garros, where she won the doubles title last year with her compatriot Barbora Krejcikova before they won Wimbledon together, too. Osaka will remain No. 1 in the singles rankings after this tournament, but she finds herself in a vulnerable position. Her victory over Williams in last year’s U.S. Open final made her a global star, increasing her sponsorship contracts and earnings exponentially and making her a focus of Japanese news coverage. She followed up by winning the Australian Open, showing a rare ability to summon her best tennis on the biggest points. But she has not reached a tour final since splitting with her coach Sascha Bajin unexpectedly after her victory in Melbourne and hiring Jermaine Jenkins as her new coach. Jenkins previously worked as Venus Williams’s hitting partner and is a former collegiate player at Clemson. After struggling early in three-set victories over Anna Karolina Schmiedlova and Victoria Azarenka in the first two rounds in Paris, Osaka started convincingly against Siniakova, putting her under consistent pressure and projecting calm confidence while Siniakova looked anxiously at her team in the players box. But as the match developed, Siniakova kept saving break points, and Osaka kept making mistakes. By the end, the better clay-court player won. “I felt the chance,” Siniakova said. “Because her first and second round was tough, so I could see that she’s not so confident like she was.” Kenin surely sensed vulnerability in Williams as well. There is plenty of it to go around in women’s tennis at this stage. But she still had to muster the gumption to finish off the champion she has been watching since Kenin was turning heads of her own as a child prodigy in South Florida. What does Kenin hope the Roland Garros crowd remembers most? “That I’m a fighter, and that I just beat Serena Williams,” she said. “Of course they are going to remember that. I’ll remember that.”",The New York Times
2019,2019 N.B.A. Draft Results: Analysis of Every Pick in Round 1,"Zion Williamson was taken No. 1 overall as expected. After the first few picks it became a round full of surprises. The first three picks went exactly as everyone thought they would. Duke’s Zion Williamson, standing head and shoulders above the rest, went to the New Orleans Pelicans, Murray State’s Ja Morant went to the Memphis Grizzlies and Williamson’s teammate at Duke, R.J. Barrett, went to the Knicks. There were numerous trades, a few deep reaches down draft boards, and an international theme highlighted by Gonzaga’s Rui Hachimura becoming the first player born in Japan to be drafted in the first round. Here’s how the draft played out: Power forward, Duke There hasn’t been a draft prospect hyped like Williamson since LeBron James in 2003. Considering the 24-hour news cycle, and the rise of social media, Williamson may actually have been talked about more. The enthusiasm is easy to understand. Williamson stands 6 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 285 pounds. Even with that massive frame, he can fly up and down the court with ease. Imagine a younger (albeit smaller) Shaquille O’Neal, with less rim protection and rebounding but better ball handling and considerably more shooting range. Williamson leaps past defenders for dunks, has a knack for finding the ball on defense and has the engaging personality that could make him a household name for years to come. In the past his height may have led some to label Williamson a ’tweener, but with the N.B.A. embracing smaller lineups, and Williamson coming off a freshman year in which he averaged 22.6 points and 8.9 rebounds a game while shooting 68 percent from the field, the expectation is that he can be ready to contribute immediately. How he fits: David Griffin and the Pelicans appear to be building something special. Williamson, who wore an all-white suit in homage to LeBron James’s draft day outfit in 2003, will join a team that already had Jrue Holiday, a terrific two-way point guard, and recently agreed to a trade with the Los Angeles Lakers for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart. Included in that trade were the eventual rights to this year’s No. 4 pick (and the Lakers’ picks for years to come), but the Pelicans have reportedly traded that pick and No. 57 to Atlanta for picks 8, 17 and 35. A highly emotional Williamson was in tears in an on-camera interview. “I don’t know what to say,” he said. “I didn’t think I’d be in this position. My mom sacrificed a lot for me and I wouldn’t be here without my mom.” Point Guard, Murray State That it took a while for people to notice Morant should not take away from how special he could be as a playmaking point guard. He finished his sophomore year with 331 assists — the sixth-best season in N.C.A.A. history — despite averaging a team-leading 24.5 points a game. He recorded three triple-doubles, including the ninth one in N.C.A.A. tournament history, and he did it all with flair, routinely getting to the rim for dunks. There are some reasons to at least raise an eyebrow at his potential. He has good height at 6 feet 3 inches, but he’s a slight 175 pounds. Considering how often he goes to the rim, that could be a combination that results in some durability issues. A lack of physical endurance may have led to his occasional lapses on defense, where he seemed to be conserving energy. He needs to clean up some of his flashier passes — which have a bad habit of turning into turnovers — and he could use work on his shooting, but those are fixable problems for a player who brings so much else to the table. How he fits: Memphis appears to have a deal with the Jazz sending Mike Conley to Utah, leaving Morant enormous shoes to fill as starting point guard and leader. The team is rebuilding in a much different mold than its grit ’n grind era, which could create an adjustment period for Grizzlies fans. But Morant and Jaren Jackson will have the keys to the franchise, and both have enough potential that Memphis could find itself winning again sometime soon. When asked where his confidence came from, Morant flashed a taste of it. “It started with me,” he said. “I feel like if you don’t believe in yourself then who will?” Shooting Guard, Duke Barrett came into the season with co-billing as the player to watch alongside Zion Williamson. He then matched his teammate in scoring (22.6 points a game), nearly matched him in rebounding (7.6 a game to Williamson’s 8.9) and topped him in assists. Yet Barrett dropped to a distant third in draft prospect rankings after Williamson and Morant far exceeded expectations. Barrett, however, should not be discounted for “just” delivering on his outstanding promise. A 6-foot-7 guard who can play bigger than that thanks to his long arms, he’s solidly built at 208 pounds at only 19 years old. He is an above-average scorer and creator, and is known for his intense play. His shooting off the dribble has been decent but he shot just 31 percent from 3-point range and 67 percent from the free-throw line, both of which are red flags. He’ll need work there, and maturity on defense, but he has all the tools he would need to succeed if he’s willing to put in the work. How he fits: The Knicks’ plan to tank for Zion Williamson resulted in them having the worst record in the N.B.A., but just the third pick in this draft. Considering the drop-off in expectations from picks 1 to 3, that letdown at the draft lottery could continue to sting for years. That being said, Barrett is a gifted young player who seems to fit well with a young core of Dennis Smith Jr., Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson. The team has the cap space to sign major free agents, leaving next year’s roster up in the air, but getting another player with length and athleticism, and one that has shown a real knack for scoring, is a decent enough consolation prize for a team that once dreamed of adding Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Williamson all in one off-season. Forward, Virginia Positively ancient at 21, Hunter is the type of player who is often labeled simply as a winner. He’s not particularly fast or explosive, he isn’t a natural scorer and he has not developed much as a passer as of yet. Despite all that, his teams always seem to benefit tremendously from having him on the court — like in the finals of this year’s N.C.A.A. tournament when he scored 27 points in Virginia’s win over Texas Tech. It was likely no coincidence that the Cavaliers’ shocking loss in the previous year’s tournament came with Hunter sidelined because of a wrist injury. The biggest reason for his “winning” ability is his N.B.A.-ready size (6-foot-7, 225 pounds with a 7-foot-2 wingspan) and his remarkable versatility on defense, where he can reasonably be asked to guard any position from point guard to power forward. His scoring improved in his sophomore season, jumping from 9.2 points a game to 15.2, and his shooting, while not a particular strength, was fairly efficient, as he shot 55 percent on 2-pointers and 43.8 percent on 3-pointers. Those numbers will fall against tighter defenses, but they indicate that he’s not an offensive liability, even if it’s his defense that keeps him on the court. How he fits: The Hawks gave up two first-rounders and swapped second-rounders to move up so they could snag Hunter, who they view as a difference-maker in the frontcourt to complement their young core of Trae Young, Kevin Huerter and John Collins. The team still has some serious depth issues going into next season, but the No. 10 pick can help with that and snagging Hunter will be the defensive answer they need on a team that was already solid on offense. Point Guard, Vanderbilt A 6-foot-3 guard who has a tremendous handle, solid footwork and the ability to create his own shot anywhere on the court, even from the irresponsible reaches of 3-point range … sound familiar? Garland may not be ready for full-throated comparisons to Damian Lillard or Stephen Curry, but there are some surface-level similarities that make him intriguing, especially after the success Trae Young had following a fairly quick adjustment to the N.B.A. Garland’s lack of physical strength shows up on the defensive end, and limits his ability to finish at the rim, but in moderate action last season he shot 11 of 23 from 3-point range and showed that he can move effectively without the ball while also finding teammates if a shot doesn’t open up for him. There are 29 or 30 teams looking for a player with that skill set. The biggest question with Garland is how explosive he will be after missing all but five games last year with a knee injury. His father, Winston, played seven seasons in the N.B.A. How he fits: Can Garland play next to Collin Sexton? That seems questionable, but Cleveland is at such a talent deficit that taking the best player available was the right option. Garland, provided his knee is sound, is the best player available — though it’s possible the team will trade him later, as it was reported that the Cavs were engaged in talks with several teams about the pick before they ran out of time. It’s possible that they hang on to Garland and slot him in with Sexton, not unlike the way Golden State paired Stephen Curry with Monta Ellis early in Curry’s career. How the team handles its redundant but talented back court is secondary to what happens with Kevin Love’s enormous contract. Shooting Guard, Texas Tech A run to the N.C.A.A. tournament final helped put Culver in the top-tier of draft prospects, as did his 6-foot-6 frame, his willingness to absorb contact at the rim and his upside as a terrific defender. He averaged 18.5 points and 6.4 rebounds a game as a sophomore, which was a huge improvement from his freshman season, and that speaks to a work ethic that has drawn a great deal of praise. That being said, he has an ugly shooting motion when he’s along the perimeter and may not be an effective weapon from distance at the pro level because of it. For his best chance at success, Culver would want to end up in a spot where he can contribute on defense while not being asked to shoulder much of an offensive load. How he fits: The Timberwolves acquired this pick in a trade with Phoenix but were reported to be trying to move it before running out of time. Should they hold onto Culver, he would join a core of Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Jeff Teague and Robert Covington on a team that was in the playoffs two years ago but is still trying to figure things out. Culver could become the type of player Minnesota was hoping Wiggins would be. Guard, North Carolina Everything moves fast with White. He excels in transition, has a quick release on catch-and-shoot opportunities, and has a flair for creativity in difficult situations. He also turns the ball over way too much, does not have much natural ability as a defender and, at 6 feet 5 inches tall, may not be big enough to create his own shots without rapidly expanding his tool kit. He’s confident, and the Tar Heels’ system allowed him to thrive in space. He averaged 16.1 points a game as a freshman and shot a decent 35.3 percent from 3-point range. If a team lets him run, he definitely adds value. A change to a more halting style could leave him overmatched. How he fits: The Bulls are still adding young talent and trying to figure out how best to build around Lauri Markkanen and Otto Porter. White, who seems like he could speed up Chicago, adds excitement to a team that was relying on Zach LaVine for that. Whether White can be a point guard rather than a shooting guard is an open question that the Bulls will need to answer quickly. Center, Texas A 7-footer who flies down the court, Hayes gets noticed for his highlight reel dunks, but he was a terrific shot-blocker at Texas as well. His ability to get into position on either end of the court, and to leverage his size for big plays makes him a fairly safe pick, almost in the mold of Brooklyn’s Jarrett Allen, who also happened to be a Longhorn. Hayes’s rebounding could be better, his passing needs a lot of work, and he was in foul trouble too often, but he knows his role and is potentially the best center in this draft. His father, Jonathan, played 12 years in the N.F.L. How he fits: The Pelicans have a center to go with the impressive assets they added to go with Jrue Holiday. Or at least they do for now, as they were reportedly trying to trade the pick. Hayes’s shot-blocking and dunking could complement Williamson and make the team even more athletic. Power Forward, Gonzaga Hachimura is big and strong, at 6 feet 9 inches and 234 pounds. He uses that size and strength to generate contact, and thanks to his long arms and enormous hands he is able to consistently finish while drawing fouls. He has shown shooting ability at each level, and teams will have to pick their poison: defend him with a smaller player who can keep up outside (while being bullied if he goes to the basket), or use a larger player who can push him back but can’t keep up with him. There are some flaws, of course. He wasn’t a great ballhandler or passer at Gonzaga and his shooting, while a plus, is more of a midrange game than anything teams will have to worry about from N.B.A. distance. His physical skills would lead you to believe he’d be a plus on defense, but that aspect of his game has been disappointing thus far. Born in Japan to Japanese and Beninese parents, he will be just the third player born in Japan to play in the N.B.A. and he is the first of the three to have been drafted in the first round. How he fits: This was earlier than many expected for Hachimura, but the fact that he did not do any workouts started a lot of speculation that he had a promise from a team. Washington is mostly a clean slate. John Wall’s return is a question mark, Bradley Beal could be traded and no one else is what you’d call a foundational piece. Hachimura could be one of the top-scoring rookies on a team that won’t have a lot of other offensive options. This is a huge moment for Japanese basketball. Hachimura was joyous on stage, seemingly unsurprised by his early selection. Asked what the pick meant, he said: “It’s unreal. It means a lot for me, my family, and all my country.” Small Forward, Duke Reddish, a high school teammate of Orlando’s Mo Bamba, looks like he should be a star. Standing 6 feet 8 inches, he has a wide build that could fill out considerably as he ages, making him the ideal size for a modern power forward. Instead he’s focused almost exclusively on playing along the perimeter, cranking out 3-pointers and showing flashes of pro-level defense. On a highlight reel he could easily come off as one of the top two or three players in this draft, and that’s what his drafting team is hoping he will become. There is cause for concern because of his inconsistency. His ability to hit difficult 3-pointers was undercut by his mediocre overall numbers from long range (33.3 percent on 267 attempts) and his awful 39.4 percent shooting from inside the arc (65 for 165). And then there’s the matter of Duke’s round of 16 game against Virginia Tech in which Reddish was a last-minute scratch because of a knee injury that Coach Mike Krzyzewski seemed to have no idea existed until right before the game started. Drafting Reddish is a bet on his potential and a signal that the team drafting him believes it has coaches who can coax the best out of him. How he fits: The Hawks had the luxury of taking a chance, with multiple picks tonight. They took a big one in Reddish, one of the highest risk/highest reward players in this draft. If he can be properly motivated and work out the rougher edges of his game he could be a perfect wing to go with Atlanta’s terrific back court. And with De’Andre Hunter locking down the defense, someone as athletic as Reddish could be a huge asset. Power Forward, North Carolina Johnson, 23, is the player Tyler Herro thinks he is: a pure knockdown shooter who could step onto an N.B.A. court and immediately start cranking out 3-pointers. He’s a 6-foot-9 inch bucket. In five years of college split between Pittsburgh and North Carolina he had a career mark of 40.5 percent from 3-point range, with that number jumping to 45.7 percent on 5.8 attempts a game last season. His biggest red flag is a few serious injuries he had to work his way back from in college. He can catch and shoot well, has a quick release and his mechanics are already pro-ready. Can he do anything else? Does that matter? How he fits: The Suns moved down in the draft, acquiring this pick from Minnesota, but scored their best shooter in Johnson. He’ll get plenty of open looks because of Deandre Ayton’s presence inside and the constant threat of Devin Booker all over the court. That could lead to some outrageous shooting statistics. Phoenix consistently adds talent but has yet to come up with the right combination. Johnson seems like a very logical choice. Power Forward, Kentucky A 6-foot-8 forward who can play as if he’s much larger, Washington brings versatility as someone who proved to be comfortable playing with his back to the basket or facing it. If his shooting improvement last year was more than a mirage, he could help a team at either forward position, or even small-ball center, and his strength could make him a terrific rebounder and defender. The biggest concern is likely his inability or unwillingness to pass. He averaged just 1.8 assists a game as a sophomore but turned the ball over 2.0 times a game. He’ll need to learn to share the ball more if he wants to stay on the court. How he fits: The Hornets have a lot of money committed to a mediocre core, and they have no idea if Kemba Walker will come back on a supermax contract. Washington doesn’t seem like a sure thing, and was a bit of a stretch this high, but if his improvement last year was real he is in a spot where he should have some time to develop. The Hornets were reported to have been looking to trade the pick, so he could be on the move. Shooting Guard, Kentucky A pure shooter. Herro shot 46.2 percent from the field, 35.5 percent from 3-point range and 93.5 percent from the free-throw line as a freshman. To watch him is to believe those numbers should only improve (maybe not the free throws). Despite not being particularly tall he can create shots for himself with a rapid stepback and his shooting form is as textbook as they come. You may need to hide him on defense, and he may never develop into much more than a gunner, but considering the shooting needs of so many teams, there are worse ways a player can be one-dimensional. How he fits: The Heat have a few good young pieces in Josh Richardson, Justise Winslow and Bam Adebayo, but they also owe a lot of money to older players of little value. Herro brings a ton of confidence and a shooting stroke that should come along nicely if they use him right. Small Forward, Indiana At 6 feet 6 inches tall, with long arms and a fairly strong build, he certainly seems like a prototypical N.B.A. wing, but a lack of outside shooting ability and poor defensive fundamentals make him a work in progress. What he can do right now is create scoring opportunities for himself and his teammates through a creative array of moves to the basket, difficult midrange jumpers and a good vision for his teammates on any given play. He can be a useful player fairly quickly, but to be a great one would require ironing out quite a few wrinkles and keeping him healthy. How he fits: The Celtics look likely to lose both Al Horford and Kyrie Irving. They still have plenty of talented young players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and the emerging Robert Williams. And if Gordon Hayward can get back to himself, Langford becomes a luxury. Power Forward, France (international) Still just 18 years old, Doumbouya, who was born in Guinea before moving to France, can play either forward position and has the length and comfort shooting from distance that could lead to him being a terrific 3-and-D player at some point. He runs well, and at 6-foot-9 with an 8-foot-11 standing reach he is easily big enough to log minutes at center in the modern game. He can likely step in as a good defender, but his offense is further behind. In his time with Limoges CSP, he sometimes showed a lack of focus, both in overall effort and in his approach to shooting, which limited his production. He would best be described as a project with a lot of potential, but his floor appears to be lower than some of the players being drafted right around him. How he fits: The Pistons already have two big men in Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin, but Griffin is handling the ball so much that Doumbouya can slot into the power forward role while learning from bigs who know their way around the league. It seems like an ideal spot for a guy who still needs a lot of work. Power Forward, Auburn Okeke is a top-notch defender who likely would have been a top-10 pick if he did not tear his anterior cruciate ligament in this year’s N.C.A.A. tournament. The rehabilitation of his injury could take nearly all of next season, but provided he makes a full recovery he is a 6-foot-8 forward capable of playing either forward position defensively. He could develop as an offensive player as well, considering he shot 38.9 percent from 3-point range in college. How he fits: The Magic may lose Nikola Vucevic, thus starting the Mo Bamba era in earnest, but with Aaron Gordon at power forward they can let Okeke get his health right and come back in 2020-21 as a player worthy of a lottery selection. Shooting Guard, Virginia Tech A high school teammate of his cousin, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Alexander-Walker is the type of player whose contributions do not always show up on the stat sheet. At 6-foot-6 and athletically built, he’s shown he can defend guards and small forwards, and while he’s not a worldbeater on offense, he’s a good enough catch-and-shoot player from distance that he can contribute. He struggles to create his own shot, and isn’t creative getting to the rim, leaving his ability to score with any regularity in doubt. How he fits: The Pelicans rebuild continues, with this pick they will get because of an earlier trade with Atlanta. They get yet another player known for his defense, as David Griffin appears to be building a team that is highly athletic and focused on that end of the floor. Alexander-Walker may not be able to score as much as you want to see from his position, but a defense consisting of Jrue Holiday, Lonzo Ball, Alexander-Walker, Zion Williamson and Jaxson Hayes is terrifying. Center, Georgia (international) A 7-footer who is listed at 250 pounds, Bitadze has the look of the big-bodied centers of yesteryear. That being said, his excellent footwork, skill as a shooter, above-average agility, nose for shot-blocking and excellent timing have him more in the mold of a poor man’s Arvydas Sabonis than a more lumbering center like Luc Longley. The most obvious area for improvement would be passing, where he has yet to show much instinct. But he could also stand to be a more aggressive shooter. His percentages show he has the ability, but he takes far fewer long shots than players who can’t match his skill. How he fits: Bitadze goes to Indiana where he will play with Arvydas Sabonis’s son, Domantas. The Pacers seemingly needed more help at point guard and small forward, but they must have thought Bitadze has a ceiling they couldn’t pass up. Playing with Myles Turner and Sabonis should help. Power Forward, Croatia (international) There’s a lot to like in a player who is built like a center and moves gracefully and swiftly on both ends of the court. Samanic isn’t a perfect shooter or a perfect defender, but he does enough of both to warrant playing time, and if he continues to develop he could overcome many of the flaws he has now, most of which can be attributed to his being just 19. His father, Marko, was a longtime professional player in Europe. How he fits: The Spurs’ reputation for international scouting is so strong that simply by selecting Samanic they will have increased the average view of the young forward. He’s in a perfect place to develop his game with the right veteran players and the right coaching staff to get him where he needs to be. Small Forward, Washington Were Thybulle’s defensive statistics a product of Washington’s scheme? That’s a huge question looming over his potential, as a glance at his stat sheet shows averages of 3.5 steals and 2.3 blocks a game as a perimeter defender. If he could come anywhere close to that at the pro level he could be a major asset to any team. The problem is, he shot well from distance in his first three years of college but dropped to 30.5 percent as a senior. As he showed no real ability at getting to the rim, and he’s not a top-notch passer or ballhandler, his value will most likely come entirely on defense. Scott Cacciola: We have another trade, per ESPN. Boston is using its pick at No. 20 to select Matisse Thybulle, a defense-minded wing from Washington, but will send his rights to Philadelphia for the Nos. 24 and 33 picks. Back to your regularly scheduled programming. How he fits: The Sixers will get a player who could be the highest-impact defender in this draft if the numbers he put up last season are a true indication of his ability. Philadelphia mostly needed depth to complement their strong core and Thybulle’s upside could help ease the sting of losing either Jimmy Butler or Tobias Harris in free agency. Power Forward, Gonzaga If the other team goes small, watch out. Clarke, whose size limits him to the 4 in some situations, is at his best when he can move over to being a small-ball 5. He’s shown an incredible ability to get to the basket, to finish through contact, and to switch gears and hit a floater if the timing of the play is off. His height (6-foot-8) and wingspan (6-foot-8.25) have him at a disadvantage against a lot of bigs, but he has a nose for offensive rebounds and blocks, both of which should help keep him on court. Clarke rarely attempted any 3-pointers, going 6 of 24 on them in three years of college, and his development will be limited since he will turn 23 before the season starts. But a team looking for a player who can get to the hoop on offense and block some shots on defense will get a lot of bang for the buck. Scott Cacciola: And one more — Oklahoma City is trading the No. 21 pick to Memphis for a second-rounder and the No. 23 pick, which the Grizzlies acquired from the Utah Jazz this week as a part of the Mike Conley trade. Got it? Good. How he fits: Clarke will end up on the Grizzlies, joining a rebuilding team headlined by Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson. They have a long way to go to build a new winner in Memphis, but Clarke’s versatility should help plug some holes, and Morant’s passing should be a huge help with Clarke’s development on offense. Clarke joins his teammate, Rui Hachimura, as first-round selections, a distinction that more typically falls to schools like North Carolina and Duke. Power Forward, Tennessee A good passer on offense and an even better defender at the college level, Williams stuck to his strengths and provided a lot of value. Whether he can keep that up in the pros, where he’ll often be at a physical disadvantage, is questionable. His shooting may not translate to the pro level, and even his defense may take a major step back until he adjusts his approach. How he fits: Williams may have been a bit of a reach here, with several higher-rated players still on the board, including players who fill a similar need to Williams like Florida State’s Mfiondu Kabengele and Darius Bazley. Williams, though, is the best defender of the three, so perhaps the Celtics decided that should be their priority as they look to complement their stable of good wings. Small Forward, New Balance (shoe company) As has been well chronicled, Bazley chose a highly-compensated internship with New Balance rather than a college career. It may have caused some fretting in previous years, but after Mitchell Robinson pulled off a prep-to-pro adjustment (with a gap year spent working out) with ease, there’s some solid precedent for Bazley to point toward. It’s unclear what his duties at New Balance were, but they appear to have resulted in Bazley’s body filling out quite a bit. From what was seen of Bazley in high school and in predraft workouts, he’s got excellent size (6-foot-9 with a standing reach of 8-foot-11) and the type of athleticism that will let him guard an array of positions. The Knicks worked Robinson into live action slowly and Bazley would likely benefit from the same treatment. How he fits: This pick has moved around a little, but Bazley is headed to the Oklahoma City Thunder where he can add some depth to a team with a ton of money committed to some veteran players who all have talent but have yet to make any noise in the playoffs since Kevin Durant left. He can ease his way in, with the Thunder having plenty of frontcourt players, and he could pay off handsomely if his ceiling is as high as it seems like it could be. Shooting Guard, Virginia He will get knocked for a lack of athleticism, and those complaints aren’t without merit, but thus far he has found a path to success everywhere he’s gone. At Virginia, that success came in the form of being an effective pickpocket on defense and a knockdown shooter on offense. That he also excels as a passer in the pick-and-roll should serve him quite well at the next level if he can make his game fast enough to compete with players who will have innumerable physical advantages over him. How he fits: Another pick that moved around, with Philadelphia trading it to Boston who is trading it to Phoenix, but Jerome will end up on a Suns team that is filling out its starting lineup in a seemingly productive way. Jerome will probably struggle a bit athletically but he has Cam Johnson to help out in that regard, and with so many other options around, Jerome could end up wide open a lot more often than he would on other teams. Small Forward, North Carolina The Tar Heels’ system may have been perfect for Coby White, but it seemed to occasionally hold Little back. A top recruit out of Orlando Christian Prep, he measures 6 feet 6 inches and 224 pounds, with long arms that give him a 7-foot-1 wingspan. He’s strong and agile, and appears to have decent mechanics as a shooter, but somehow it never seemed to come together in his time at North Carolina. It didn’t help that he only played 18.2 minutes a game. Somehow Little’s draft stock survived an underwhelming freshman season. The tools seem to be there for him to develop into a useful player, but the team that drafts him will need to work on his shooting, his ball handling, his court vision and will want to clean up some of his mistakes on the defensive end as well. How he fits: This is terrific value for the Trail Blazers. Little has been the top player available for quite a while, and as a wing he should be able to get playing time almost immediately. He needs a ton of work, but drafting this late Portland got a player who at least has the potential for stardom — a huge win. Small Forward, Belmont A career 41 percent shooter from 3-point range, Windler came from a small school and doesn’t do much other than shoot, but with the N.B.A.’s emphasis on shooting now, his value skyrocketed. A serious area for concern, though, is how much he seemed to fade against stiff competition. How he fits: Cleveland already added Darius Garland to Collin Sexton, so their playmaking was all set. Cedi Osman is strong in the middle and thus gives them a knockdown shooter. Or at least they hope it does. If he can’t handle better college teams, he may struggle against N.B.A. teams. Center, Florida State Don’t let his listed height of 6 feet 10 inches fool you: Kabengele’s standing reach is 9 feet 1.5 inches and he plays as big as a 7-footer — though not quite in the same mold as his uncle, Dikembe Mutombo. Kabengele’s size serves him well as he defends in the paint and along the perimeter, while on offense he can easily see over defenders to create his own shot. He’s comically unwilling to pass, with just 21 assists in 71 career games for the Seminoles, and he’s inconsistent. But players his size who can move like him and shoot like him don’t come along often. How he fits: Once a trade becomes official, Kabengele will head to the Los Angeles Clippers where he joins a deep team that was a ton of fun in 2018-19 and could get even more fun now. Everyone will be waiting to see if Kawhi Leonard signs there, but in the interim, Clippers fans can look forward to some incredible highlights. Whether those highlights turn into consistent production is anyone’s guess. Shooting Guard, Michigan Poole improved as a sophomore, hitting 36.9 percent of his 3-pointers on 5.5 attempts a game. He was known to take over portions of games, but he was also known to occasionally disappear. His confidence is sky high and he clearly believes he has N.B.A. range as a shooter. He may not have much else. How he fits: The Warriors could lose Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson to free agency, and at the very least they will be without both of them for most of the upcoming season. Poole offers another shooter to take some of the pressure off Stephen Curry. If he can be the shooter he thinks he is, perhaps no one will have to hear the phrase box-and-one next year. Poole is a big stretch at this pick, with 20 or more players ahead of him on most draft boards, but he may be the best shooter available and Golden State clearly decided that was their priority. Small Forward, Kentucky Strong enough to handle the 4, while mostly playing the 3, Johnson makes good use of his length on both ends of the floor and is an aggressive player who puts in a lot of effort. His 38.1 percent mark from 3-point range could also be a plus, but when you combine it with his awkward form, his slow release, and the fact that he only made 70.3 percent of his free-throws, there is reason to speculate if he can be a competent shooter at the next level. His floor is a high-energy defender who can score a little, which in this draft makes him a top-20 prospect. How he fits: How do the Spurs do it? Johnson has been one of the top-two picks available for ages, with several teams passing up a player who would likely be able to contribute for them next season. Now he ends up in San Antonio where his defense will be valued and the team has enough other options that if Johnson’s shot takes a while to develop it’s not a big deal. Shooting Guard, Southern California If Porter gets the ball in transition, watch out. The 6-foot-6, 220-pounder is at his best with a head of steam. He can adjust to transition defenses with ease, slicing around them or powering through them. Unfortunately, the sample size on him is desperately small. He started in just four of his 21 games for the Trojans and averaged just 22.1 minutes a game. As a result, it’s hard to get too excited about his 9.5 points and four rebounds a game, even if he looked good putting up those numbers. He has yet to show a knack for off-ball movement, and his approach to the game is erratic, but most of his issues seem to be a need for coaching rather than anything wrong with him as a player. Despite going by Kevin Porter Jr., he is not related to Kevin Porter, the former N.B.A. point guard. The Jr. is in reference to his father, Kevin Sr., who was shot and killed in 2004. How he fits: After a few trades becomes official, Porter will head to Cleveland, a team that has restocked its cupboards quickly. He has a lot of work to do, but he was easily one of the best players left on the board and Cleveland must believe it can harness his raw talent. His selection means Oregon’s Bol Bol, a player once thought of as a top-15 pick, has fallen out of the first round. Griffin, who built a champion in Cleveland, is undoubtedly not done, but winning the right to select Williamson was the biggest early win he could have asked for. With Holiday and Ball throwing Williamson lobs, the league is about to find out very quickly what it feels like to be dunked on by a 285-pound teenager. (Some second round picks have been included in trades that are not yet official. The listed team is the one that currently owns the pick, not necessarily the team that will end up with the player.) 31. Nets: Nic Claxton, C, Georgia Drafting Claxton is a bet on his potential — but there’s a lot of potential. Nearly 7 feet tall with wide shoulders and long arms, its easy to see him putting on a great deal of muscle to help combat the physical play that teams used to beat him in college. He is a terrific ballhandler and could easily develop into a top-notch defender. Beyond simply filling out his body, Claxton should be locked in a gym working on his shooting. 32. Suns: K.Z. Okpala, SF, Stanford Okpala has the size typically associated with a power forward but can move very effectively with the ball with a handle that makes him look like an enormous guard when he has the ball. He’s prone to mistakes, needs to work on his passing and his free-throw rate in college could be a red flag for his shooting, but he’s already big (6-foot-9, 210 pounds) and figures to put on a great deal of muscle in the next few years. 33. 76ers: Carsen Edwards, PG, Purdue No one thought much of Edwards as a prospect before his huge performance in the N.C.A.A. tournament, and plenty are still incredibly dubious now. Was that a hot streak or is he really a terrific shooter in the mold of Lou Williams with the ability to leverage his athleticism into making up for his undersized 6 foot frame? It’s a big bet on a handful of games. 34. 76ers: Bruno Fernando, C, Maryland Fernando can’t compare to many of the other prospects in terms of refined basketball skills, but they can’t compare to him in ideal size and strength. He stands 6 feet 10.25 inches in shoes, weighs 237 pounds with just 5 percent body fat, and has a standing reach of 9-foot-2 that would be more typical of someone taller than 7 feet. He has yet to turn that into much of anything on either end of the court, at least not consistently, but he’s worth a flier just to see if he can. 35. Hawks: Marcos Louzada Silva, SF, Brazil 36. Hornets: Cody Martin, SF, Nevada 37. Mavericks: Deividas Sirvydis, SF, Lithuania 38. Bulls: Daniel Gafford, C, Arkansas 39. Pelicans: Alen Smailagic, PF, Santa Cruz Warriors (G-League) 40. Kings: Justin James, SG, Wyoming 41. Warriors: Eric Paschall, PF, Villanova Strong and long despite being just 6-foot-7, Paschall seems like he could hold his own against smaller power forwards and centers but it’s unclear how he’ll deal with the handful of athletic 7-footers at the pro level. On most nights he will be able to use his strength and leaping ability to affect the game on both ends of the floor, especially with a tendency toward maximum effort that will help him fight past bigger players for rebounds (his bulky frame and long arms are reminiscent of Draymond Green). He was a streaky shooter at Villanova and might have to work on his fundamentals to become a plus there, but his ability to finish at the rim can tide him over. 42. 76ers: Admiral Schofield, SF, Tennessee A short bulky wing, Schofield, at 6 foot 4, looks like a power forward hit with a shrink ray. He turned himself into a good shooter over the course of his college career and seemingly has the strength to do more, but to this point he has not proven himself as a strong rebounder or shot-blocker, and there’s even some question about whether his shooting mechanics are pro-worthy. His supporters would point to his having elevated his game against top competition in college for proof that he can make the leap. 43. Timberwolves: Jaylen Nowell, SG, Washington 44. Heat: Bol Bol, C, Oregon Unlike his father, Manute, Bol Bol is more than just a shot-blocking savant. His standing reach of 9 feet 7.5 inches makes him even more imposing than his 7-2 height would suggest and in limited action in college he averaged 21 points and 9.6 rebounds a game. He has as fluid of movement as you’re likely to see in a player of his size and a surprising shooting touch at every level that made him especially deadly since no player can effectively get in his face to guard him. Considered a top-20 player on many draft boards, he was left in the green room on the floor of Barclays Center deep into the second round and his selection was greeted with raucous cheers by the crowd. His durability is a real concern — he played just nine games in college — and the rigors of a long season could be too much for him to handle. That lack of physical endurance could help explain why he also seemed to lack consistent effort when he was on the court. But unlike Tacko Fall, an even larger player who is seen as something of an anachronism, Bol has the skill to succeed in the modern game. It seems like he’ll just need to want to do the extra work to make it happen. 45. Pistons: Isaiah Roby, PF, Nebraska 46. Magic: Talen Horton-Tucker, SF, Iowa State Like Villanova’s Eric Paschall, Horton-Tucker draws some Draymond Green comparisons for being a stout forward with long arms that allow him to compete with players that are far larger. He actually profiles even closer to Green than Paschall does, considering his ability to create shots for teammates, but Horton-Tucker is shorter than either of the comps, at 6 feet 4 inches (he was measured at 6-foot-2.5 barefoot), making his four-position impact in college hard to translate at the pro level. He will need a similar maximum effort to Green to overcome his disadvantages and Green’s intensity doesn’t happen very often. 47. Kings: Ignas Brazdeikis, SF, Michigan 48. Clippers: Terance Mann, SF, Florida State 49. Spurs: Quinndary Weatherspoon, SG, Missouri State 50. Pacers: Jarrell Brantley, PF, College of Charleston 51. Celtics: Tremont Waters, PG, Louisiana State 52. Hornets: Jalen McDaniels, PF, San Diego State 53. Jazz: Justin Wright-Foreman, PG, Hofstra 54. 76ers: Marial Shayok, SF, Iowa State 55. Knicks: Kyle Guy, PG, Virginia 56. Clippers: Jaylen Hands, PG, U.C.L.A. 57. Pelicans: Jordan Bone, PG, Tennessee 58. Warriors: Miye Oni, SG, Yale 59. Raptors: Dewan Hernandez, C, Miami 60. Kings: Vanja Marinkovic, SG, Serbia",The New York Times
2019,"2019 N.H.L. Draft: Devils Take Jack Hughes at No. 1, and the Rangers Pick Kaapo Kakko","VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko can’t escape each other, even though they come from opposite sides of the hockey world. This pair of 18-year-olds — Hughes, who was born in Florida and now lives in Michigan, and Kakko, a native of Turku, Finland — have shared space at the top of most N.H.L. draft ranking lists for the past year. Now they will enter the league on teams separated by the Hudson River, just 13 miles apart. As expected, the Devils selected Hughes first in the draft on Friday, and the Rangers used the second pick to take Kakko. Both teams were set up for these prizes at the draft lottery in April. After finishing 29th in the N.H.L. standings last season, the Devils won the first pick for the second time in three years. The Rangers finished 26th, and Kakko is their first top-five pick in two decades, since Pavel Brendl was chosen fourth in 1999. At the start of the draft, Devils General Manager Ray Shero built suspense by taking his time before introducing Martin Brodeur, the former Devil and Hockey Hall of Famer, to call Hughes’s name. “The only time I really got nervous was when Ray was talking up there for two minutes or so,” Hughes said of waiting for Brodeur. “To hear him call my name was pretty special.” Though Kakko and Hughes were often paired at the top of rankings by scouting services and the news media, the first pick was no surprise. Hughes invariably was rated just a bit higher. He is the product of a hockey family. His father, Jim, and his mother, Ellen, played the game, and Jim has continued to work in hockey in coaching and player development positions. His older brother, Quinn, 19, was drafted seventh by the Vancouver Canucks in 2018, and his younger brother, Luke, 15, will join the national team program in the fall. The family’s connections in the hockey world have allowed Hughes to build relationships in the N.H.L. well ahead of his arrival in the league. His new general manager, Shero, once worked as his father’s agent. Hughes has also had an opportunity to skate with many N.H.L. players, including Taylor Hall, one of his new teammates. “I know him a little bit through training with him, texted a little bit,” Hughes, a center, said of Hall, who won the Hart Trophy as the league’s most valuable player in 2018. “I’m excited to be on his team.” The Rangers are equally excited about adding Kakko, who set a record for goals by a draft-eligible prospect in Finland’s top league last season. In international play, he became the first player to win gold at the world under-18 tournament, the world junior championship and the world championship before being drafted. “I can hardly wait to see the fans at Madison Square Garden watch this kid grow before their eyes,” the Rangers team president, John Davidson, said. “It’s going to be marvelous.” “I was a little bit nervous before this, but now I’m so excited,” said Kakko, who will soon visit New York for the first time in his life. “It was my dream to be No. 1, but of course, the second one is also good. I’m happy.” Kakko, a wing, is the fourth Finn in the last four years to be among the top three choices in the draft, following Jesperi Kotkaniemi (No. 3 in 2018), Miro Heiskanen (No. 3 in 2017) and Patrik Laine (No. 2 in 2016). Hughes is the eighth American ever to become the No. 1 pick in the N.H.L. and the fifth from the United States national team development program. After setting a program record with 228 career points over two seasons, he hopes to be the first player to step directly from the national development program into the N.H.L. “That’s my goal,” Hughes said. “I want to be the first player to kind of break a barrier there, that you can go from the program to playing in the N.H.L. the following year.” With the 23rd pick, the Islanders selected right wing Simon Holmstrom from Sweden. Rounds two through seven of the draft will continue Saturday in Vancouver.",The New York Times

2019,"United States Beats Chile, 3-0, at Women’s World Cup","PARIS — Menacing and dominating a second straight opponent, the United States women’s national team advanced to the second round of the World Cup with a 3-0 victory against Chile on Sunday. Carli Lloyd scored twice and Julie Ertz once for the Americans, who turned in their second straight comprehensive victory and ran their goal total to 18 for and none against through two matches in the tournament. The victory, and Sweden’s earlier in the day against Thailand, ensured that both teams would advance to the knockout rounds. They will play one another for first place in Group F on Thursday in Le Havre. The group winner faces a likely date with host France, perhaps the second-best team in the tournament thus far, in the quarterfinals. Only a tremendous effort by Chile’s goalkeeper, Christiane Endler, kept the United States-Chile result closer than something resembling the scoreline in the Americans’ first game against Thailand. Endler was named player of the game, a rare occurrence for a goalkeeper in a game in which her team lost by three goals and was outshot, 26-1. Lloyd gave the Americans the lead with a rifled left-footed shot in the 11th minute and then, after Ertz doubled the lead off a corner kick, added her second goal with a header of her own off a corner in the 35th minute. She missed out on a chance for a hat trick when she pulled a penalty kick wide in the 81st minute. The United States peppered Endler throughout the game, but she was at her best in the second half, when, in quick succession, she produced wonderful reaction saves to thwart Lindsey Horan and then Christen Press (twice). In that same stretch of the game, the substitute Jessica McDonald hit the right post and Lloyd dinged the crossbar for the United States. The victory pulled Sweden through to the knockout stages along with the Americans; the Swedes beat Thailand, 5-1, in Sunday’s early game in Nice. 88’ Chile has shown just enough fight, and gotten just enough luck and a spectacular game from Endler, that the fourth goal we all felt has been coming in this one might not arrive. That’s probably a fair reward for Endler, who kept this from being 7-0 or 8-0 all by herself. 81’ Maybe that’s karmic justice for the odd penalty decision, but Lloyd misses a chance to get her hat trick by yanking her attempt wide of both Endler and the left post. We stay at 3-0. Emily Sonnett quietly replaces Dahlkemper after the play. That’s the final U.S. substitute. 80’ The first test of V.A.R. for the United States in the World Cup catches Chile’s Yessenia Huenteo pulling down Allie Long at the top of the area. Curious decision, since it appeared to happen outside the area. Lloyd up to seal her hat trick .... 71’ Finally, someone gets a ball beyond Endler, and now it’s the bar that keeps it out. Lloyd really seemed sure she had her hat trick there. That fourth goal really still seems like it’s coming though ..... 66’ She’ll be (wo)man of the match at this rate in a game in which her team never had a chance. A rifled cross from Pugh, nodded through by McDonald to Press, who turns a stiff header in at the far post, only to see Endler reach behind her to push it aside. “That was extraordinary,” Rory Smith exclaims in the seat next to me. He’s right. 64’ That fourth goal is coming soon. Endler was beaten there, as McDonald cut inside after being led down the left wing by Lloyd. Her long curling shot from just outside the area pings the outside of the far post though. 58’ Brian switches the play to the left for Press, and she sizes up the lofted ball perfectly and one-times it with her right foot. Endler parries, but that had a Zidane feel to it, and might have deserved better. Horan off after the play, replaced by Allie Long, who makes her 2019 World Cup debut. No rest for Chile in her. 55’ A terrific through ball springs Press down the left, and she cuts the ball back at the end line for Horan on the doorstep. Horan meets it perfectly with her left foot, but Endler — somehow — sticks a foot out and sends the ball over the ball. What a pass by Press, and what a save. 53’ As expected, the United States has shifted into what is effectively a 4-2-4, with Brian and Horan resisting every urge to make it a six-player front line. The U.S. is still winning every free ball in midfield, and even accidents — like a slip by Brian that handed Chile a 3v3 counterattack — are swiftly cleaned up and neutralized. 46’ Jessica McDonald, a first-time World Cup player at age 31, makes her debut by replacing Julie Ertz at halftime. But McDonald is a striker and Ertz was a holding midfielder, a position the Americans haven’t had much need for today. Four forwards in a game her team is dominating? For the second game in a row? Man, Ellis isn’t messing around in France. Halftime Carli Lloyd had two goals and Julie Ertz one and — except for a momentary blunder that saw a free ball roll harmlessly into the American net — Jill Ellis will not have seen a lot to complain about in that half. The United States may have swapped in a bunch of reserves but they are playing with the same kind of drive and purpose they showed against Thailand: probing balls, not hopeful ones; a bit of bite, especially from Horan, who got the half’s only yellow card; and absolutely ruthless finishing. And this with their three best forwards on the bench today. Chile has some figuring to do, but they’ve showed their teeth at times — especially Saez, who was lucky to avoid a yellow on a late sweep of Pugh’s legs at the end line. But Thailand trailed by 3-0 at halftime, too, and we saw what happened then. Ellis still has even bigger guns to fire if she chooses. 35’ Lloyd cuts hard to the center on the next corner and nods in her second. Easy peasy. 32’ Ertz’s goal and Lloyd’s before it were two of the best examples yet of what separates the Americans from most of the world: clinical, dominant finishing. They don’t hope to score goals: they voraciously pursue them, and have the skills and the instincts to take advantage of even the slightest openings. Chile’s Yanera Aedo said as much on Saturday. Her team gave up five set-piece goals to the Americans in two games last fall. “We learned that even two seconds of not concentrating on what you’re doing can produce a goal,” she said. 26’ A corner from Davidson from the right meets a charging Ertz at the near post, and she flips it past Endler with the back of her head. That’s a pro’s finish there. 23’ That may a mess: a cross leads Carla Guerrero, and Naeher charges off her line. Both miss the ball, though, and it trickles into the net. Chile celebrates, but the lineswoman has her flag up as soon as the ball rolls across the line. And she’s right: Guerrero was a step or two ahead. 11’ Big mistake from Saez there, who sends a weak clearing header to the center at the top of the penalty area. Lloyd eats those for lunch, and she ripped a left-footed shot past Endler, who never moved, and the United States is ahead, 1-0. Rocket of a shot, and Lloyd’s second goal of the tournament. 4’ Saez turned a cross right into her own goalkeeper, and Lloyd is there for the rebound. But she hits the post, and Endler smothers the loose ball. Chile verrrrry lucky there. 1’ Chile kicked off, and in two passes the ball was at Endler’s feet because of U.S. pressure. Now the Americans have won a corner; Endler punches it right to Brian, but she fires over the bar from the spot. United States lineup: Alyssa Naeher; Tierna Davidson, Becky Sauerbrunn, Abby Dahlkemper, Ali Krieger; Lindsey Horan, Julie Ertz, Morgan Brian; Christen Press, Carli Lloyd (c), Mallory Pugh. Chile lineup: Christiane Endler; Javiera Toro, Camila Saez, Carla Guerrero, Su Helen Galaz; Francisca Lara, Karen Araya, Claudia Soto; Rosario Balmaceda, Maria Jose Urrutia, Daniela Zamora. A reporter asked Lindsey Horan on Saturday if she considered the United States the best offense in the world. “I like to think that,” Horan said. “I think what’s so special about this team is the depth in it.” Well, Jill Ellis is sure showing off that trait today: she has made seven changes from the team that she sent out to demolish Thailand. Her second-string front line — Press, Lloyd and Pugh — replaces Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath. But that’s hardly it. Morgan Brian, the last player to make the U.S. roster, starts in midfield, and Tierna Davidson (in her first World Cup game) and Ali Krieger (in her 14th) are in for outside backs Crystal Dunn and Kelley O’Hara. Davidson, 20, is the youngest player to start a World Cup match for the United States since Tiffany Roberts in 1995. Becky Sauerbrunn returns at center back, too; she was held out of the Thailand game with what was described by team officials as a “quad” issue. It’s unlikely, but never say never. It’s hard to imagine the United States matching the sheer dominance of last week’s baker’s-dozen thrashing of overmatched Thailand. But Thailand, at No. 34, is actually five spots ahead of Chile in the current FIFA world rankings, though that may have to do more with the team’s recent history than their current state. One positive for Chile is that it has a world-class goalkeeper organizing its defense: Christiane Endler. Endler, 27, grew up with little ambition of making a career in soccer, but eventually was encouraged to commit herself to goalkeeping. After starting for Chile as a 17-year-old in the 2008 FIFA Under-20 World Cup, she made her way to the University of South Florida and then the Europe, where she has been named the top goalkeeper in Spain (with Valencia) and France (with Paris St.-Germain this season). The United States surely knows about her: when the teams played two friendlies last fall, Endler made a combined 17 saves in the two games. But merely holding the score down again is not the goal on Sunday. “When we come out to play a match, we don’t come out thinking, Oh, let’s lose but not by much,” midfielder Yanara Aedo said. “I don’t think it would be a victory if the U.S. beats us not by a lot of goals, but by only a few goals. It’s not a victory to lose by a small margin against the U.S.A. A victory for us is to play well, to the best of our capabilities, and playing the way we know to play.” The United States and Chile played twice last fall, three months before they were drawn into the same World Cup group. Are there lessons to be learned from those meetings? Perhaps. Unsurprisingly, the United States dominated both matches, winning by 3-0 and 4-0. The majority of the goals came off set pieces, which if often the case when a skilled, well-trained elite team meets a far more inexperienced one. “They were obvious really intense matches,” Aedo said. “We knew that they were really high-speed games, Any kind of rival that is as quick and as physical as they are, they don’t give you much time to think on you feet. “For most of us in the team, it’s actually been useful to see how that elite of women’s soccer plays, so we can sort of judge ourselves against them, measure where we’re actually at. “We got a lot out of it. We learned that even two seconds of not concentrating on what you’re doing can produce a counterattack and a goal. So we maybe know a little more of what we’ve got in front of us.”",The New York Times
2019,"United States Beats Chile, 3-0, at Women’s World Cup","PARIS — Menacing and dominating a second straight opponent, the United States women’s national team advanced to the second round of the World Cup with a 3-0 victory against Chile on Sunday. Carli Lloyd scored twice and Julie Ertz once for the Americans, who turned in their second straight comprehensive victory and ran their goal total to 18 for and none against through two matches in the tournament. The victory, and Sweden’s earlier in the day against Thailand, ensured that both teams would advance to the knockout rounds. They will play one another for first place in Group F on Thursday in Le Havre. The group winner faces a likely date with host France, perhaps the second-best team in the tournament thus far, in the quarterfinals. Only a tremendous effort by Chile’s goalkeeper, Christiane Endler, kept the United States-Chile result closer than something resembling the scoreline in the Americans’ first game against Thailand. Endler was named player of the game, a rare occurrence for a goalkeeper in a game in which her team lost by three goals and was outshot, 26-1. Lloyd gave the Americans the lead with a rifled left-footed shot in the 11th minute and then, after Ertz doubled the lead off a corner kick, added her second goal with a header of her own off a corner in the 35th minute. She missed out on a chance for a hat trick when she pulled a penalty kick wide in the 81st minute. The United States peppered Endler throughout the game, but she was at her best in the second half, when, in quick succession, she produced wonderful reaction saves to thwart Lindsey Horan and then Christen Press (twice). In that same stretch of the game, the substitute Jessica McDonald hit the right post and Lloyd dinged the crossbar for the United States. The victory pulled Sweden through to the knockout stages along with the Americans; the Swedes beat Thailand, 5-1, in Sunday’s early game in Nice. 88’ Chile has shown just enough fight, and gotten just enough luck and a spectacular game from Endler, that the fourth goal we all felt has been coming in this one might not arrive.

2019,"2020 Debate, Robert Mueller, Pride: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. And we’re off to the races. The economy dominated the first Democratic debate of the 2020 presidential race early on, but the topic quickly turned to immigration, Iran and climate change. Follow along here for live updates and analysis from our reporters. Twenty candidates from the sprawling field will split the debate stage between tonight and tomorrow night. Here are some political dynamics and tension points to watch for. And here is every 2020 candidate roasted via haiku by a comedy writer to add some levity to your night. _____ 2. “It never ends.” With Robert Mueller set to testify next month, President Trump lashed out at the special counsel, repeating false claims that Mr. Mueller’s investigators had destroyed text messages by F.B.I. officials critical of the president. In an interview with Fox Business Network, the president also blasted the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, and suggested that no one had heard of Mr. Powell until Mr. Trump tapped him to run the Fed. Separately, a House panel voted to subpoena the presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway over her “egregious, repeated, and very public violations” of federal ethics laws. _____ 3. The Senate approved $4.6 billion in border funding with few strings attached, setting up a clash with the House, which yesterday passed a competing bill that aims to rein in President Trump’s immigration crackdown. House Democrats say the Senate measure does too little to ensure improvements at juvenile detention centers. Accounts of horrific conditions facing unaccompanied migrant children, as well as a wrenching photo of a drowned father and daughter trying to seek asylum, have inflamed the urgency surrounding passage of emergency aid measures. Administration officials have warned Congress that they will run out of funds to house and care for migrants at the end of the month. _____ 4. Boris Johnson, the front-runner to become the next British prime minister, is frequently caught in gaffes, oversights and outright lies. And that’s what his supporters like about him. Here’s how he became one of the great escape artists of British politics. Our Interpreter columnists noted last week that he also embodies the British ideal that it is “preferable to have success without visibly striving to achieve it.” Politics aside, the heat is on in most of Europe: Meteorologists say temperatures could climb above 40 degrees Celsius, or more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit, across large stretches of the continent. _____ 5. Buying low (tops) to sell high (tops). Online marketplaces like StockX have turned rare Jordans and Yeezys into tradable commodities. Now the sneaker-trading start-up has hired a new chief executive, pictured above left with the company’s founder, to expand its business and scored a fresh round of financing that values it at more than $1 billion. The rise of StockX, along with competitors like GOAT Group, Stadium Goods and Bump, is pushing brands and retailers to rethink the potential of resale sites as serious distribution channels. Few shoes are more revered by sneakerheads than Nike Air Force 1s. A Times Magazine contributor writes that the iconic shoes “were sacred in my town, and still are. We Baltimoreans call them ‘Airs’ because they’re as important to us as oxygen.” _____ 6. Pride parades were inspired by the 1969 Stonewall riots, which pitted L.G.B.T.Q. people against the police. So do officers belong at Pride today? Activists have long debated that question, and with Pride festivities underway around the world, the complicated issue is on the front burner. Meanwhile, Jenna Wortham writes about the history and joy of queer parties, which have historically offered a place for road-testing new looks, identity expressions, desires and orientations. _____ 7. For years, tours of historic Southern homes focused on their architecture and fine furniture, but not on how slave labor created the wealth on display. Now that’s changing as some plantations and museums tell stories of slavery that fill in the gaps, revealing the black people who built the residences. “What we’re looking at is the political power of the people who lived here,” said Lacey Wilson, above, a historic interpreter in Savannah, Ga. “All the beautiful decorative objects throughout the house — the money coming for all these things came primarily from the enslaving of other human beings.” _____ 8. “Dreams From My Father.” “Hold Still.” “This Boy’s Life.” The New York Times’s book critics selected the 50 most outstanding memoirs published in the past 50 years. Here’s how they made their choices, including Vivian Gornick’s memoir on growing up in the Bronx, pictured above in 1958. “I was looking for memoirs that really crack open a world, that have the intensity of first-rate novels, that make us feel we’ve been brought along on an adventure,” said Dwight Garner. And for all you would-be editors out there, here’s the latest installment of our copy editing quiz. _____ 9. And now for a delicacy inspired by Ikea. The negroni that Gabrielle Hamilton serves at her New York restaurant derives from a trip to Rome, and her Calvados omelet is a homage to a summer in France. But her overstuffed rock-shrimp roll was inspired by a bike ride in Brooklyn to the Swedish furniture store (true to its origin, some assembly is required). If you’re looking for something on the heartier side, Yotam Ottolenghi shares his tips for the best British pie. Sourdough chunks are the perfect pairing for a creamy celebration of seafood. _____ 10. Finally, escaping the tyranny of the clock. Residents of a picturesque Norwegian island called Sommaroy, just north of the Arctic Circle, want to banish clocks and live beyond the constraints of time. That’s because, for them, once the sun rises on May 18, it does not set again until July 26. Residents, who are already fond of playing soccer, kayaking or mowing the grass in the middle of the night, have filed a petition to create what they say would be the world’s first “time free” zone. To be clear, the luxury of timelessness would mostly be for those who have time off in the first place: Classes at the local school, students will be relieved to know, would not go on forever. Have a bright night. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

2019,2020 Democrats Address Poverty and Systemic Racism at Presidential Forum,"WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. struck a notably different tone than some other Democrats on Monday over how to bring about change in government, defending his approach to working with Republicans during an appearance at a forum where he and eight other presidential candidates shared their views on addressing poverty. Mr. Biden suggested that those who cannot conceive of compromising with the opposition might as well “start a real, physical revolution.” “Folks, look, if you start off with the notion there’s nothing you can do, well, might you all go home then, man?” he said. “Or let’s start a real, physical revolution if you’re talking about it. Because we have to be able to change what we’re doing within our system.” Mr. Biden, who has drawn criticism from some liberals for his efforts to appeal to moderates in a polarized era, also expressed confidence about how he would fare in the South if he wins the Democratic nomination and faces President Trump in the general election. He said that he planned on winning North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, and that he believed he could win Florida and Texas as well. Mr. Biden made his comments at a forum convened by the Poor People’s Campaign, which seeks to draw attention to issues like poverty and systemic racism. It is a revival of the campaign that was planned by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. before his assassination a half-century ago. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] Mr. Biden, who leads in early polling of the Democratic presidential race, was the first candidate to speak at the event, held at Trinity Washington University in the nation’s capital. He described poverty as “the one thing that can bring this country down.” Hours later, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also talked about a revolution, but in a different way: He repeated his call for a “political revolution.” “Today and in the last 45 years, we heard a whole lot of talk and a whole lot of speeches and a whole lot of party platforms,” Mr. Sanders said. “But you know what goes on? Today, the average worker in America is making exactly the same wages that he or she made 45 years ago.” The candidates touched on a variety of subjects affecting lower-income people. Mr. Sanders reiterated his call for voting rights for incarcerated people. Senator Kamala Harris of California, a former prosecutor, spoke of changing the cash bail system and providing relief to renters. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts outlined her plan to create a wealth tax and use the proceeds to pay for programs like universal child care. On the matter of how to deal with likely Republican opposition in the Senate, Ms. Warren went in a different direction than Mr. Biden. She repeated her call to get rid of the Senate filibuster if necessary, so that a narrow Democratic majority in that chamber could push through legislation over Republican objections. “We have to be willing to get in this fight,” Ms. Warren said. The Poor People’s Campaign is led by the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, a civil rights leader from North Carolina, and the Rev. Dr. Liz Theoharis, the director of Kairos: The Center for Religions, Rights and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary in New York. The issue of poverty is at the heart of the campaign. In 2017, about 40 million people in the United States were in poverty, or roughly 12 percent of the population, according to the Census Bureau. To show the scope of the issue, however, the campaign says that by another measure, some 140 million people can be considered either poor or low-income. [We’d like to know: What do you want the candidates to talk about at the debates?] “The word ‘poor’ has basically become a four-letter word for the past half a century,” Dr. Theoharis said in an interview. “If some politicians talk about it, it’s to punish and demonize people who are poor. And many, including many Democrats, refuse to even talk about the poor.” The candidate forum was an effort to put a spotlight on the subject. “There has to be a narrative shift,” Dr. Barber said in an interview. “If we keep having an anemic, small, limited political debate and discussion, we’re going to keep getting what we’ve always gotten.” Before the forum on Monday, the Poor People’s Campaign and the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank, released the Poor People’s Moral Budget, a lengthy collection of policy proposals intended to help establish a “moral economy.” The proposals included reducing military spending by nearly half and increasing taxes on corporations and wealthy people, including creating a wealth tax that mirrors what Ms. Warren has proposed. Organizers of the forum said Mr. Trump was invited to appear but did not respond. The Trump campaign declined to comment.",The New York Times
2019,21 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Holland Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘AUSCHWITZ. NOT LONG AGO. NOT FAR AWAY’ at the Museum of Jewish Heritage (through Jan. 3). Killing as a communal business, made widely lucrative by the Third Reich, permeates this traveling exhibition about the largest German death camp, Auschwitz, whose yawning gatehouse, with its converging rail tracks, has become emblematic of the Holocaust. Well timed, during a worldwide surge of anti-Semitism, the harrowing installation strives, successfully, for fresh relevance. The exhibition illuminates the topography of evil, the deliberate designing of a hell on earth by fanatical racists and compliant architects and provisioners, while also highlighting the strenuous struggle for survival in a place where, as Primo Levi learned, “there is no why.” (Ralph Blumenthal) 646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org ‘CAMP: NOTES ON FASHION’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 8). Inspired by Susan Sontag’s famous 1964 essay, “Notes on ‘Camp,’” the latest spectacular from the Met’s Costume Institute attempts to define this elastic, constantly evolving concept, which leaves taste, seriousness and heteronormativity in the dust. The show researches camp’s emergence in 18th-century France and 19th-century England, examines “Sontagian Camp” and culminates in an immense gallery of designer confectionaries from the 1980s to now that calls to mind a big, shiny Christmas tree barricaded with presents. (Roberta Smith) 212-535-7100, metmuseum.org ‘LEONARD COHEN: A CRACK IN EVERYTHING’ at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 8). The curators of this show, John Zeppetelli of the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen. Some are simple and quiet, like “Ear on a Worm” from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in the space that shows a perched bird, a reference to “Bird on the Wire” from Cohen’s 1969 album “Songs From a Room.” Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok’s “Passing Through,” which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer’s body changes with time. Taken together, the layered work on display has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation. (Mark Richardson) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘MAYBE MAYBE NOT: CHRISTOPHER WOOL AND THE HILL COLLECTION’ at the Hill Art Foundation (through June 28). This foundation’s inaugural show presents more than a dozen paintings, works on paper and photographs by Wool, the painter who wrenched abstraction into the No Wave era. In a stenciled painting from 1989, the drippy black letters of the word “SPOKESMAN” are arranged three by three, filling the white aluminum background with the same deductive logic as Frank Stella’s early stripes. After making layered, silk-screened floral patterns in the 1990s, Wool became more gestural; three extraordinary paintings here from the 2000s, with cloudy spray-gun loop-de-loops and merciless erasures, exhibit a simultaneous love and doubt of abstraction that recalls the best of Albert Oehlen. His enthrallingly difficult later silk screens cannibalize his own archive, discordantly remixing earlier works and treating paint as both material and information. (Farago) 212-337-4455, hillartfoundation.org ‘OCEAN WONDERS: SHARKS!’ at the New York Aquarium (ongoing). For years, the aquarium’s 14-acre campus hunkered behind a wall, turning its back to the beach. When aquarium officials last year finally got around to completing the long-promised building that houses this new shark exhibit, maybe the biggest move, architecturally speaking, was breaking through that wall. The overall effect makes the aquarium more of a visible, welcoming presence along the boardwalk. Inside, “Ocean Wonders” features 115 species sharing 784,000 gallons of water. It stresses timely eco-consciousness, introducing visitors to shark habitats, explaining how critical sharks are to the ocean’s food chains and ecologies, debunking myths about the danger sharks pose to people while documenting the threats people pose to sharks via overfishing and pollution. The narrow, snaking layout suggests an underwater landscape carved by water. Past the exit, an outdoor ramp inclines visitors toward the roof of the building where the Atlantic Ocean suddenly spreads out below. You can see Luna Park in one direction, Brighton Beach in the other. The architectural point becomes clear: Sharks aren’t just movie stars and aquarium attractions. They’re also our neighbors — as much a part of Coney Island as the roller coasters and summer dreams. (Michael Kimmelman)718-265-3474, nyaquarium.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘PLAY IT LOUD: INSTRUMENTS OF ROCK & ROLL’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 1). Presented in collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, this exhibition offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and ’70s sits firmly at the center. The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section and another showcasing “Guitar Gods.” Yet another room has a display highlighting the guitar’s destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend. To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for “Creating a Sound,” which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics. The lighting in “Play It Loud” is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it’s catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn’t diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty. (Richardson) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘PUNK LUST: RAW PROVOCATION 1971-1985’ at the Museum of Sex (through Nov. 30). This show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: The 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream. In the story told by “Punk Lust,” much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show’s curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical — underage groupies cavorting with rock stars — images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation. (Richardson) 212-689-6337, museumofsex.com ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org STATUE OF LIBERTY MUSEUM on Liberty Island (ongoing). Security concerns stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks led the National Park Service to restrict the number of people who could go inside the Statue of Liberty’s massive stone pedestal and up to the crown. So the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation wanted to offer something more for visitors who found the outdoor view less than satisfying: a stand-alone museum on the island that would welcome everyone who wanted to hear the story behind Lady Liberty. Going beyond the vague and often dubious ideal of American “liberty,” the museum’s displays highlight the doubts of black Americans and women who saw their personal liberties compromised on a daily basis in the 1880s, when the statue opened. These exhibits also spotlight a bit of history that is often forgotten: that the French creators intended the statue as a commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the United States. (Julia Jacobs)statueoflibertymuseum.org ‘TOO FAST TO LIVE, TOO YOUNG TO DIE: PUNK GRAPHICS, 1976-1986’ at the Museum of Arts and Design (through Aug. 18). Many of the objects on display in this exhibition were first hung in record stores or in the bedrooms of teenagers. Posters promoting new albums, tours and shows are mixed in with album art, zines, buttons and other miscellany. Most of the pieces are affixed to the walls with magnets and are not framed, and almost all show signs of wear. The presentation reinforces that this was commercial art meant for wide consumption, and the ragged edges and prominent creases in the works make the history feel alive. (Richardson) 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘2019 WHITNEY BIENNIAL’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 22). Given the political tensions that have sent spasms through the nation over the past two years, you might have expected — hoped — that this year’s biennial would be one big, sharp Occupy-style yawp. It isn’t. Politics are present but, with a few notable exceptions, murmured, coded, stitched into the weave of fastidiously form-conscious, labor-intensive work. As a result, the exhibition, organized by two young Whitney curators, Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta, gives the initial impression of being a well-groomed group show rather than a statement of resistance. But once you start looking closely, the impression changes artist by artist, piece by piece — there’s quiet agitation in the air. (Cotter) 212-570-3600, whitney.org ‘JEFF WALL’ at Gagosian (through July 26). Rumination and risk-taking, in equal measure, mark this conceptual photographer’s spellbinding new exhibition. The show, Wall’s first at this Chelsea gallery since ending a 25-year run with the rival dealer Marian Goodman, feels decidedly introspective. Figures alone in contemplative trances, or alienated from their partners in scenes of evident tension, define most of the works. The encyclopedic visual literacy that has long characterized Wall’s pictures (with their compositional echoes of Old Master paintings) has been pared back, allowing more psychological complexity to emerge. Just as new is an emphasis on narrative and sequence; among the pieces are two diptychs and an enveloping, cinematic triptych. (Karen Rosenberg) 212-741-1717, gagosian.com ‘MATTHEW BARNEY: REDOUBT’ at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven (through June 16). The wildly innovative sculptor and filmmaker, Yale class of 1989, heads back to the halls of ivy to present his first major project since the six-hour excremental eruption of “River of Fundament.” The exhibition shows Barney in a lighter, nimbler mode than he has displayed in years. The new film “Redoubt,” shot in his home state of Idaho, riffs on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; the goddess, here, is an NRA-approved sharpshooter, while the doomed voyeur is the artist himself, making plein-air etchings of Diana and her attendants. Related copper etchings appear in the show, and Barney has electroplated them over varying times, encrusting them with weird metal nodules. “Redoubt” lacks the operatic grandeur some of Barney’s fanboys prefer. But it’s the most emancipated work of his career, and it should make a star of Eleanor Bauer, the dancer and choreographer whom he has entrusted with the film’s most beautiful movement sequences. The film runs about two hours; check the website for screening times. (Farago) 203-432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu ‘LINCOLN KIRSTEIN’S MODERN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘THE SELF-PORTRAIT, FROM SCHIELE TO BECKMANN’ at the Neue Galerie (through June 24). Self-portraiture can seem pretty narrow. But the 70-odd works in this exhibition, which run from a handful of delightfully exact Rembrandt etchings to Felix Nussbaum’s searing 1940 painting “Self-Portrait in the Camp,” ably demonstrate the genre’s universal scope: It’s a consciously constructed illusion of spontaneous self-revelation, a sincere put-on. And as such it’s a peek beneath the hood of art in general. (Will Heinrich) 212-994-9493, neuegalerie.org ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org",The New York Times

Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression.

(Karen Rosenberg) 212-741-1717, gagosian.com ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘MATTHEW BARNEY: REDOUBT’ at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven (through June 16). The wildly innovative sculptor and filmmaker, Yale class of 1989, heads back to the halls of ivy to present his first major project since the six-hour excremental eruption of “River of Fundament.” The exhibition shows Barney in a lighter, nimbler mode than he has displayed in years. The new film “Redoubt,” shot in his home state of Idaho, riffs on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; the goddess, here, is an NRA-approved sharpshooter, while the doomed voyeur is the artist himself, making plein-air etchings of Diana and her attendants. Related copper etchings appear in the show, and Barney has electroplated them over varying times, encrusting them with weird metal nodules. “Redoubt” lacks the operatic grandeur some of Barney’s fanboys prefer. But it’s the most emancipated work of his career, and it should make a star of Eleanor Bauer, the dancer and choreographer whom he has entrusted with the film’s most beautiful movement sequences. The film runs about two hours and screens on Saturday afternoons and on select weekdays; check the website for times. (Farago) 203-432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu ‘LINCOLN KIRSTEIN’S MODERN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘RADICALISM IN THE WILDERNESS: JAPANESE ARTISTS IN THE GLOBAL 1960S’ at Japan Society (through June 9). This sturdy addition to our story of the global 1960s, organized by the respected art historian Reiko Tomii, introduces American audiences to three bold positions in Japanese art — by one solo figure and two collectives who all worked far from the lights of Tokyo. Yutaka Matsuzawa, a Conceptualist with a Buddhist streak working in a forest near Nagano, made posters and mail art that aimed to imagine a world of total nothingness. The group GUN, in agrarian Niigata, produced breathtaking land art by filling pesticide sprayers with pigment and spewing color across fresh snow. And the Play, a collective in the Kansai region, sailed together on barges or built tree houses on hillsides to rediscover freedoms beyond social boundaries. The lesson: It’s not just the opposition of East and West that needs rethinking, but that of the metropolis and the sticks. (Farago) 212-715-1258, japansociety.org",The New York Times
2019,23 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘ART AFTER STONEWALL, 1969-1989’ at Grey Art Gallery (through July 20) and at Leslie-Lohman Museum (through July 21). For this summer’s half-century anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall riots, substantial displays of art produced in the long wake of the uprising are filling New York City museums and public spaces. The largest is this two-part exhibition, organized by Jonathan Weinberg and shared by Grey Art Gallery at N.Y.U. and Leslie-Lohman Museum. The Leslie-Lohman half, which focuses on the 1970s and has lots of archival matter, feels tight and combustible. Much of what’s in it was hot off the political burner, responsive to crisis conditions. The pace at Grey, where much of the work dates from the 1980s, is more measured, but has tensions of its own as the story encompasses AIDS and the culture wars. (Holland Cotter) 212-998-6780, greyartgallery.nyu.edu 212-431-2609, leslielohman.org ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘AUSCHWITZ. NOT LONG AGO. NOT FAR AWAY’ at the Museum of Jewish Heritage (through Jan. 3). Killing as a communal business, made widely lucrative by the Third Reich, permeates this traveling exhibition about the largest German death camp, Auschwitz, whose yawning gatehouse, with its converging rail tracks, has become emblematic of the Holocaust. Well timed, during a worldwide surge of anti-Semitism, the harrowing installation strives, successfully, for fresh relevance. The exhibition illuminates the topography of evil, the deliberate designing of a hell on earth by fanatical racists and compliant architects and provisioners, while also highlighting the strenuous struggle for survival in a place where, as Primo Levi learned, “there is no why.” (Ralph Blumenthal) 646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org ‘CAMP: NOTES ON FASHION’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 8). Inspired by Susan Sontag’s famous 1964 essay, “Notes on ‘Camp,’” the latest spectacular from the Met’s Costume Institute attempts to define this elastic, constantly evolving concept, which leaves taste, seriousness and heteronormativity in the dust. The show researches camp’s emergence in 18th-century France and 19th-century England, examines “Sontagian Camp” and culminates in an immense gallery of designer confectionaries from the 1980s to now that calls to mind a big, shiny Christmas tree barricaded with presents. (Roberta Smith) 212-535-7100, metmuseum.org ‘LEONARD COHEN: A CRACK IN EVERYTHING’ at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 8). The curators of this show, John Zeppetelli of the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen. Some are simple and quiet, like “Ear on a Worm” from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in the space that shows a perched bird, a reference to “Bird on the Wire” from Cohen’s 1969 album “Songs From a Room.” Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok’s “Passing Through,” which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer’s body changes with time. Taken together, the layered work on display has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation. (Mark Richardson) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘CYCLING IN THE CITY: A 200-YEAR HISTORY’ at the Museum of the City of New York (through Oct. 6). The complex past, present and future roles of the bicycle as a vehicle for both social progress and strife are explored in this exhibition. With more than 150 objects — including 14 bicycles and vintage cycling apparel — it traces the transformation of cycling’s significance from a form of democratized transportation, which gave women and immigrants a sense of freedom, to a political football that continues to pit the city’s more than 800,000 cyclists against their detractors today. (Julianne McShane) 212-534-1672, mcny.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘LOVE & RESISTANCE: STONEWALL 50’ at New York Public Library (through July 13). Organized by Jason Baumann, this archival show functions as a timeline of the gay rights movement from the founding of the Mattachine Society in the 1950s through Stonewall and its immediate aftermath. Pictures by Diana Davies and Kay Tobin Lahusen, lesbian photojournalists, mark a forward path that is lined with protest posters, dance club fliers and L.G.T.B.Q. publications (Transvestia, Demi-Gods, Third World Women’s Gayzette). (Cotter) 917-275-6975, nypl.org ‘NOBODY PROMISED YOU TOMORROW: 50 YEARS AFTER STONEWALL’ at Brooklyn Museum (through Dec. 8). In this large group show, 28 young queer and transgender artists, most born after 1980, carry the buzz of Stonewall resistance into the present. Historical heroes, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, are honored (in a film by Sasha Wortzel and Tourmaline). Friends in life, Johnson and Rivera are tutelary spirits of an exhibition in which a trans presence, long marginalized by mainstream gay politics, is pronounced in the work of Juliana Huxtable, Hugo Gyrl, Amaryllis DeJesus Moleski and Elle Pérez (who is also in the current Whitney Biennial). (Cotter) 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org ‘OCEAN WONDERS: SHARKS!’ at the New York Aquarium (ongoing). For years, the aquarium’s 14-acre campus hunkered behind a wall, turning its back to the beach. When aquarium officials last year finally got around to completing the long-promised building that houses this new shark exhibit, maybe the biggest move, architecturally speaking, was breaking through that wall. The overall effect makes the aquarium more of a visible, welcoming presence along the boardwalk. Inside, “Ocean Wonders” features 115 species sharing 784,000 gallons of water. It stresses timely eco-consciousness, introducing visitors to shark habitats, explaining how critical sharks are to the ocean’s food chains and ecologies, debunking myths about the danger sharks pose to people while documenting the threats people pose to sharks via overfishing and pollution. The narrow, snaking layout suggests an underwater landscape carved by water. Past the exit, an outdoor ramp inclines visitors toward the roof of the building where the Atlantic Ocean suddenly spreads out below. You can see Luna Park in one direction, Brighton Beach in the other. The architectural point becomes clear: Sharks aren’t just movie stars and aquarium attractions. They’re also our neighbors — as much a part of Coney Island as the roller coasters and summer dreams.

Presented in collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, this exhibition offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and ’70s sits firmly at the center. The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section and another showcasing “Guitar Gods.” Yet another room has a display highlighting the guitar’s destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend. To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for “Creating a Sound,” which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics. The lighting in “Play It Loud” is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it’s catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn’t diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty. (Richardson) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘CHARLOTTE POSENENSKE: WORK IN PROGRESS’ at Dia Art Foundation in Beacon, N.Y. (through Sept. 9). This Hudson Valley institution continues its satisfying enlargement of its roll call of Miminalists and Conceptualists with a major showcase of this German artist, who showed her modular, industrially inspired sculptures alongside Donald Judd and Frank Stella in the late 1960s, but then abandoned art for sociology. Posenenske’s most important works were free-standing pipes, made of sheet steel or cardboard, that look almost exactly like commercial air ducts. Unlike some of the control freaks whose art is also on view here, Posenenske made her art in infinite editions, out of parts that can be arranged in any shape you like: a generous distribution of authorship from the artist to her fabricators and collectors. (Farago) diaart.org ‘PUNK LUST: RAW PROVOCATION 1971-1985’ at the Museum of Sex (through Nov. 30). This show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: The 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream. In the story told by “Punk Lust,” much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show’s curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical — underage groupies cavorting with rock stars — images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation. (Richardson) 212-689-6337, museumofsex.com ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org STATUE OF LIBERTY MUSEUM on Liberty Island (ongoing). Security concerns stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks led the National Park Service to restrict the number of people who could go inside the Statue of Liberty’s massive stone pedestal and up to the crown. So the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation wanted to offer something more for visitors who found the outdoor view less than satisfying: a stand-alone museum on the island that would welcome everyone who wanted to hear the story behind Lady Liberty. Going beyond the vague and often dubious ideal of American “liberty,” the museum’s displays highlight the doubts of black Americans and women who saw their personal liberties compromised on a daily basis in the 1880s, when the statue opened. These exhibits also spotlight a bit of history that is often forgotten: that the French creators intended the statue as a commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the United States. (Julia Jacobs) statueoflibertymuseum.org ‘STONEWALL 50 AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY’ (through Sept. 22). For its Stonewall summer, the society offers a bouquet of three micro-shows. One is devoted to relics of L.G.B.T.Q. night life, from the 1950s lesbian bar called the Sea Colony to the gay male sex clubs like the Anvil and the Ramrod that sizzled in the 1970s. Another documents the founding in 1974 — by Joan Nestle, Deborah Edel, Sahli Cavallero, Pamela Olin and Julia Stanley — of a compendious and still-growing register of lesbian culture called the Herstory Archives. And a third turns a solo spotlight on charismatic individuals: Storme DeLarverie (1920-2014), Mother Flawless Sabrina/Jack Doroshow (1939-2017), Keith Haring (1958-90) and Rollerena Fairy Godmother. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘TOO FAST TO LIVE, TOO YOUNG TO DIE: PUNK GRAPHICS, 1976-1986’ at the Museum of Arts and Design (through Aug. 18). Many of the objects on display in this exhibition were first hung in record stores or in the bedrooms of teenagers. Posters promoting new albums, tours and shows are mixed in with album art, zines, buttons and other miscellany. Most of the pieces are affixed to the walls with magnets and are not framed, and almost all show signs of wear. The presentation reinforces that this was commercial art meant for wide consumption, and the ragged edges and prominent creases in the works make the history feel alive. (Richardson) 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘2019 WHITNEY BIENNIAL’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 22). Given the political tensions that have sent spasms through the nation over the past two years, you might have expected — hoped — that this year’s biennial would be one big, sharp Occupy-style yawp. It isn’t. Politics are present but, with a few notable exceptions, murmured, coded, stitched into the weave of fastidiously form-conscious, labor-intensive work. As a result, the exhibition, organized by two young Whitney curators, Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta, gives the initial impression of being a well-groomed group show rather than a statement of resistance. But once you start looking closely, the impression changes artist by artist, piece by piece — there’s quiet agitation in the air. (Cotter) 212-570-3600, whitney.org ‘VIOLET HOLDINGS: LGBTQ+ HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE N.Y.U. SPECIAL COLLECTIONS’ at Bobst Library (through Dec. 31). With the Stonewall Inn now a National Historic Landmark (and a bar again; it was a bagel shop in the 1980s), nearby New York University has produced a homegrown archival exhibition at Bobst Library, across the park from Grey Art Gallery. Organized by Hugh Ryan, it takes the local history of queer identity back to the 19th century with documents on Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952), an American actor, suffragist and friend of Virginia Woolf, and forward with ephemera related to the musician and drag king Johnny Science (1955-2007) and the African-American D.J. Larry Levan (1954-92), who, in the 1980s, presided, godlike, at a gay disco called the Paradise Garage, which was a short walk from the campus. (Cotter) 212-998-2500, library.nyu.edu ‘JEFF WALL’ at Gagosian (through July 26). Rumination and risk-taking, in equal measure, mark this conceptual photographer’s spellbinding new exhibition. The show, Wall’s first at this Chelsea gallery since ending a 25-year run with the rival dealer Marian Goodman, feels decidedly introspective. Figures alone in contemplative trances, or alienated from their partners in scenes of evident tension, define most of the works. The encyclopedic visual literacy that has long characterized Wall’s pictures (with their compositional echoes of old master paintings) has been pared back, allowing more psychological complexity to emerge. Just as new is an emphasis on narrative and sequence; among the pieces are two diptychs and an enveloping, cinematic triptych. (Karen Rosenberg) 212-741-1717, gagosian.com ‘MAYBE MAYBE NOT: CHRISTOPHER WOOL AND THE HILL COLLECTION’ at the Hill Art Foundation (through June 28). This foundation’s inaugural show presents more than a dozen paintings, works on paper and photographs by Wool, the painter who wrenched abstraction into the No Wave era. In a stenciled painting from 1989, the drippy black letters of the word “SPOKESMAN” are arranged three by three, filling the white aluminum background with the same deductive logic as Frank Stella’s early stripes. After making layered, silk-screened floral patterns in the 1990s, Wool became more gestural; three extraordinary paintings here from the 2000s, with cloudy spray-gun loop-de-loops and merciless erasures, exhibit a simultaneous love and doubt of abstraction that recalls the best of Albert Oehlen. His enthrallingly difficult later silk screens cannibalize his own archive, discordantly remixing earlier works and treating paint as both material and information.

2019,23 Democrats Are Running for President. Do Any of Them Know What They’re Doing?,"Feature How do you unite a fractious base and defeat President Trump? No one seems to know, but that isn’t stopping them from giving it a try. CreditCreditPhoto illustration by Doug Chayka It was late on a Saturday night in May, and Marianne Williamson — the best-selling self-help author, spiritual sage and one of 23 souls vying to be the Democrats’ next presidential nominee — was sitting at a kitchen island in a large home on the western edge of Des Moines, nursing a generous glass of red wine. Her traveling aide, an extremely tall young woman named Tandra, was seated cross-legged on the floor a few feet away, next to a basket of fuzzy baby chickens. Williamson was winding down after a long night of campaigning. She had just ministered to the guests at a reception held in her honor, holding forth on a back porch for an hour and a half about the “moral and spiritual awakening” she vowed to lead from the White House in order to “heal the low-level emotional civil war” underway in a broken America. Now the party was breaking up, most of the guests had left and the candidate seemed somewhat forlorn. “I’m finding this a bit confusing,” Williamson told me, looking up from the island. She was trying to make sense of the rules determining who would qualify for a place in the Democratic presidential debates in late June. At first, she believed she had cleared the Democratic National Committee’s threshold for participation, having received the requisite donations from 65,000 people. “But now they’re saying something new about polls,” she said. I first met Williamson, who is 66, five years ago, during her only previous foray into electoral politics. She was then one of 18 candidates running for a congressional seat in the Botox Belt of Southern California — Beverly Hills, Malibu, Bel Air — long held by the retiring Democrat Henry Waxman. Williamson was perhaps the best known among them: spiritual counselor to Oprah Winfrey, guru to Cher and even an officiant at one of Elizabeth Taylor’s (eight) weddings. She won support from Katy Perry and Alanis Morissette, and her campaign events turned up the occasional Kardashian. But this had not been enough to send Williamson to Congress. And so now Williamson was doing what every Democratic politician or candidate, successful or otherwise, seemed to be doing in 2019: running for president. I had seen four of them in Iowa in the previous 36 hours, and Pete Buttigieg over the border in Minnesota two nights earlier: Elizabeth Warren in Ames and Iowa Falls on Friday, Amy Klobuchar in Des Moines on Saturday morning, Bernie Sanders in Ames that afternoon and Klobuchar again in Iowa City that evening before I returned to Des Moines to drop in on Williamson. When Williamson first announced her exploratory committee in November, her bid to be the Mike Gravel of 2020 — the self-assured oddball who kept the debates interesting — was a solid one: The only declared competition in the snowball’s-chance lane was John Delaney, a replacement-level Maryland congressman, and Andrew Yang, a New York businessman and universal-basic-income advocate who has said he hopes to campaign via hologram in some states. But six months later, any aspiring Mike Gravel hoping to grab a percent or two in the polls had to compete with multiple Western governors (John Hickenlooper, Steve Bullock, Jay Inslee) and senators (Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker), a Housing and Urban Development secretary (Julián Castro) and even the 89-year-old Gravel himself (who was dragooned into running again by a pair of teenage political activists). The border between curiosities and contenders had never seemed so porous, and new candidates seemed to be parachuting in every week; there was a report the day before that Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York would soon be joining the race. “The more the merrier, right?” Klobuchar, an ostensibly formidable hopeful who was polling in very low single digits, told me after a rally in an Iowa City restaurant. She smirked and shook her head. “That’s what our line is, right?” Theoretically, this open season of a campaign was a boon to nontraditional aspirants like Williamson. Practically speaking, however, it posed all kinds of problems — like the question of how you even got on the debate stage, which seemed to be Williamson’s main preoccupation at this moment. “Do you know anything about how this works?” she asked me. If there is something that unites the nearly two dozen Democrats currently in the field, it is that no one, really, knows how this works. It’s a cliché at this point to say that Trump changed politics in 2016, and that everyone — candidates, operatives and media — is still scrambling to understand the implications of his victory. No doubt, Trump humbled the experts (you’d hope) and blew up notions of how politicians should behave and what voters would allow. He also ushered in a free-for-all mentality that might account in part for the “Why not me?” stampede on the Democratic side, which now includes everyone from Obama’s goofy-uncle V.P. on down to the guy live-streaming his visit to the dentist to the spiritual guru sipping wine in front of me as tiny peeps emanated from a basket of chicks. But focusing too much on Trump misses the full degree to which uncertainty has become the overriding new norm — in American life, not just politics. Our notions have changed about what it means to be viable, familiar and authentic as public actors. Politics is just one arena in which this shift has been playing out. Up close, the early race for the Democratic nomination can resemble a mass reconnaissance process, with the candidates as advance troops scouting an electorate that their party so badly misunderstood the last time around. How exactly do you run for president in 2019? What are the rules, and what should you say and who is even listening? At their unruly best, campaigns can be sprawling idea labs. You can learn a lot when no one knows anything. I spent a few weeks trying to divine where exactly this has left the Democrats, both as individual campaigns and as a chaotic body of energized particles. There were big and enthusiastic crowds and campaigns trying to play nice with one another, at least in public (and at least for now). Polls have been mostly steady, with the best-known candidates (Biden, Sanders) at the top, followed by a shifting cast of risers (Warren, Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) and a trailing horde of 1-percenters and vanity candidates bringing up the crowded rear. Candidates have alternately enjoyed media-darling status or wondered why they weren’t breaking through. They hate it when people ask if they’d want to be someone’s vice president or maybe consider (Hickenlooper, Bullock, O’Rourke) running for Senate back home (Colorado, Montana, Texas) instead of running around telling New Hampshire voters how special they and their silly primary are. But there is far less unity among the various campaigns, and sometimes within the candidates’ own heads, about how they plan to engage with voters and, ultimately, campaign against Trump. Beating him has quite obviously been a preoccupation of Democratic voters since the moment of his election, far beyond the typical level of urgency about defeating the incumbent president from the other party. “Electability” has thus become even more of a watchword than usual, leading to circular takes in which voters tend to channel the last pundit they saw yammering on TV about so-and-so’s fund-raising prowess or admirable message discipline. I began my tour of the field on a Saturday morning in early May at a farmers’ market in downtown Des Moines, the first of the season. A few candidates were expected to make the rounds here, including Bernie Sanders, who (per Twitter) was given a bag of mesclun by an admirer before he headed north to Ames for a rally at Iowa State University, in the same venue where I watched Elizabeth Warren a day earlier. At first blush, Sanders 2020 looks and sounds quite a bit like the candidate who monkey-wrenched Hillary’s campaign in 2016. In the student center in Ames, they played Tracy Chapman singing about how finally the tables are starting to turn, while Ben Cohen, the wild-haired Ben and Jerry’s guy, introduced the similarly wild-haired Brooklyn-born Vermonter with flavorful assurance. “He’s been in Washington, in the House and in the Senate, for 30 years,” Cohen said. “He understands the cesspool of what is our political system today. And he’s the guy who therefore will be able to flush the crap down the drain.” Sanders took his usual big swing, aiming less at Trump per se than at the entire corrupt system, including the trivial preoccupations of the idiots who give you the news. “You hear the media, and the media will talk about somebody raised a lot of money today, and somebody attacked somebody else today, and a poll showed this and that today and somebody said something dumb,” Sanders said at the rally. “Or somebody slipped on a banana peel, you know, and, oh, my God, front-page story.” “All right, what is politics about?” Sanders went on. “Think out of the box, not what’s on TV tonight.” He warned the young people in the college crowd against being cynical. “Don’t let your friends tell you that politics is all [expletive], and they don’t have the time to get involved,” he said. “Tell them to stop moaning and groaning.” He walked off to the Doobie Brothers’ “Takin’ It to the Streets.” Circulating in a Bernie crowd, you don’t hear paeans to how their candidate will unite the country and work well across the aisle. There is some frustration too with the expanding chorus of candidates crowding out their message. “Most of these people have no idea why they’re running,” said Ashton Ayers, an Iowa State student from Ottumwa who has supported Sanders since seeing him speak in the basement of a church in 2014. “It’s a big ego trip.” Ayers, who wore a Eugene Debs T-shirt, said he would not commit himself to supporting the eventual Democratic nominee if he or she was not sufficiently progressive. He was unconvinced that Democrats needed to find the candidate the party establishment deemed mainstream enough to take on the incumbent. Recent precedent supports his argument. Obama-loathing Republicans, for instance, nominated future loser Mitt Romney in 2012, and Bush-loathing Democrats opted for nonpresident John Kerry in 2004 (instead of the more inspiring but riskier Howard Dean). If you figure in losing establishment nominees like Hillary Clinton (in 2016) and relative outsiders who actually won (Obama in 2008), there’s a lot to suggest that “safe” has a shaky recent track record. “I’ve voted for many moderate Democrats in general elections,” Ayers told me, including Clinton against Trump. “They always lose.” Later that afternoon, I caught up with Klobuchar at a restaurant in Iowa City where she had just held her own rally. I had encountered her earlier in the day at the Des Moines farmers’ market, where she was gamely posing for photos with a macaw named Jacks perched on her arm. The bird belonged to an Iowa state representative named Ako Abdul-Samad, who was accompanying Klobuchar and feeding the bird sugar snap peas. I asked Klobuchar, who had shed the macaw and was now ensconced in a corner booth, whether she was worried that the Democratic field was becoming problematically large. Klobuchar’s main concern, she said, was getting enough of a shot at a televised stage on which to be heard. “After these first two debates, they’re going to have to do something,” she said. (A few weeks later, the D.N.C. announced a higher threshold for the third and fourth debates.) Debates are vital to a candidate like Klobuchar, whose appeal translates much better in formats that reward quick thinking and wit. The Minnesota senator is at her best in conversational settings — inasmuch as conversation is possible at these cattle calls — where she can tout her pragmatic reputation in the Senate and bipartisan bona fides. Klobuchar sponsored or contributed to 34 bills that became law under President Trump and has been decisively elected three times in an increasingly purple state. Given Clinton’s defeats in previously blue Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, it has become imperative for candidates from the Midwest (Klobuchar, Buttigieg) to remind everyone that they possess this geographical fairy dust. “I think you all know, I announced my candidacy in the middle of that snowstorm,” Klobuchar told the crowd in Iowa City. We did all know this; she loves talking about it. “Yep, I could’ve gone inside, but is that what a good Midwesterner would do?” (“Nooo!”) In a Fox News town hall a few days later, Klobuchar tried to give herself the nickname Heartland Amy, though it appears to not yet be sticking. As voters are sounding more like TV pundits, candidates seem more willing than usual to talk like political strategists. They share their particular theories for how they are best equipped to take on Trump. You can of course spin this Rubik’s cube a million different ways and land on a million different profiles that suit any particular argument. For instance, Democrats clearly need to nominate a candidate who is not a white male and who is from the Midwest, preferably from a purple state, and someone whom enough Republicans are down with — or so says the future President Klobuchar. “Hillary Clinton ran a strong race,” Klobuchar said at her rally in Iowa City, drawing cursory applause. “But no one had ever run against the likes of Donald Trump before, right? And now we have all learned.” She spoke with self-assurance, as if she had cracked some elusive code, but her prescriptions seemed a bit anodyne and unoriginal, if not necessarily wrong. “He doesn’t even care who he pisses off, he just sends out a tweet so that he controls the news cycle,” she said. “Sometimes, guys? You ignore him.” J. Ann Selzer, a pollster who has been a fixture of the Iowa political landscape for three decades, said that in a March survey, likely Democratic caucus voters expressed overwhelming preference for candidates who emphasized a “positive” message. They placed a much greater importance on health care (81 percent of respondents) and climate change (80 percent) than they did impeachment (22 percent). But David Plouffe, Obama’s campaign manager in 2008, argues that while you can ignore Trump, Democrats do need to reckon with what it was about Trump that appealed to his supporters, some of whom voted for him after voting for Obama twice. “I do think there will be a question we will all answer,” Plouffe said. “Are we looking for our version of Trump? Are we looking for the polar opposite? A blend? No matter how you look at this, Trump is a factor in everything.” “Change the channel,” Pete Buttigieg was telling me a few nights earlier in Minneapolis. “That’s sort of what this is about. There has to be a different feel.” The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was greeting a procession of friends in a basement holding room at the Fine Line Music Café, a downtown nightclub. In about 20 minutes, he would be speaking at a small-donor fund-raiser, for which a crowd of over 400 guests were currently lined up around the block. He was sitting on a couch and jiggling a bottle of water between his right thumb and index finger, clenching it hard enough to leave a large dent in the plastic. He was talking about authenticity, which as a political notion has become an obsession in the Trump years. “Now, interestingly, even though the president is fake in some ways, it is true on another level that what you see is what you get,” Buttigieg said. “And I want to make sure that it’s the one thing I have in common with him.” Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, later told me: “The big idea about Trump was that he was talking plain and telling it like it is, even though he was lying all the time. It was authentic lying.” “I think about this a lot, especially with all these questions about what authenticity means,” Buttigieg continued. “You can think about it too much.” He chuckled. “It’s supposed to be effortless, right?” The echoes of Obama 2008 are unmistakable with Buttigieg. Like Obama in 2008, Buttigieg resists the “I’m a fighter” crutch on which so much Democratic messaging has leaned for decades. “It can be exhausting,” Buttigieg said of this pugilism fixation. He has called it a “fetish.” He urged me not to mistake his aversion to fight-club rhetoric for complacency. “Dr. King was speaking for some of the most marginalized people ever when he said darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can drive out darkness,” Buttigieg told me. “If anything, when he’s talking about fierceness and urgency and anger, it’s dealing with white liberals who are dragging their feet.” Upstairs, a roomful of white liberals were stomping their feet in the club, chanting, “We want Pete.” They got Pete. He came out to Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Up Around the Bend,” which seemed like a strange walk-up song until I learned that “the Bend” is apparently what South Bend is sometimes referred to by locals, including its mayor. Buttigieg barely mentioned Trump, except to emphasize that he tries not to talk too much about him. “This president,” Buttigieg said, “like all grotesque things, is hard to look away from.” It’s important to try, he went on. “Because if it’s all about him, it’s not about you.” Elizabeth Warren seems especially proud of her ability to ignore the inescapable — Trump — as a hockey player with a broken leg would be loath to admit pain. “Did I even mention him at all?” the Massachusetts senator asked me following a house party where she spoke in Iowa Falls. I replied that yes, she had in fact mentioned Trump once, in response to a question she received about the special prosecutor Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation. “I got a question,” she told me, suggesting that it didn’t really count. Among the Democratic contenders, Warren is distinguished by the think tank’s worth of policy proposals she has churned out since entering the race, a program she would probably be campaigning on regardless of who currently occupied the White House. Still, Warren’s one riff relating to Trump — she described how she was against impeaching him but changed her mind after reading the Mueller report — elicited the loudest applause in Iowa Falls. Her impeachment call in late April coincided with the start of her recent jump in the polls. Likewise, Warren received a great deal of attention for her refusal to appear on Fox News and for dismissing the network as a “Hate-for-Profit Racket.” Both stances won Warren good will from the party’s liberal base, though spurning Fox was somewhat controversial. To many Democratic strategists, invading Trump’s safe cable space is an underutilized way to provoke the president. “We know that it gets in Trump’s head, and Democrats should be all over that,” Plouffe said, adding that appearing on Fox News could be a centerpiece of any “psy-ops” strategy against Trump. “How do you destabilize this guy? How do you throw him off his game? He is, I think, very vulnerable to that.” In the event of an emergency, as many Democrats view the prospect of a second term for Donald Trump, it’s natural to gravitate to a security blanket, no matter how itchy: Joe Biden, in other words. In the middle of May, the former vice president was making his maiden swing through New Hampshire. His first stop was a pizza bistro in Hampton, lunchtime on a drizzly Monday. A hundred or so bodies were jammed in, seemingly half of them New Hampshire state representatives wearing name-tag pins, many saying they had known the former vice president for years. “Good to see you, man,” Biden said, patting the shoulders of a guy in a Boston Bruins cap near the entrance. Like the Democratic field he leads, Biden’s stump speech, at the multiple rallies where I heard it, was an unruly mess. He name-drops “Barack” a lot. The rest is a familiar-for-him mishmash: several references to his family tragedies, calls for national unity and vows to not to “get down into mud wrestling” with Trump. He had the week before called him a “no-good S.O.B.” and a “clown,” among other things. Biden’s face tends not to move, but you sense furious activity going on behind his eyes. It is as if armies of little chipmunks are working all kinds of levers, reminding him of what notes to hit or people to mention and terms that could now run him afoul of the Woke Police. Mostly, he seems a bit rusty, stepping gingerly into a world of Twitter vigilantes that did not exist the last time he ran for president, in 2008, much less the first time, 20 years earlier, when his campaign was incinerated by a video of his lifting a speech from the British Labor leader Neil Kinnock. Flashes of hesitation crossed his face at the Hampton pizza joint. “My wife, who’s a college professor,” he said, then paused. “A junior-college professor,” he clarified, before clarifying again: “community-college professor.” The safe candidate grabs for safe things — the parable Biden has been telling for years, for instance, which I heard again at a rally that night in Nashua, about how his father used to tell him: “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about your place in the community, it’s about respect, it’s about being able to look your child in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be O.K.’ and mean it.” That basic American promise is dead and needs to be restored, Biden says. The last guy won by promising a return to a mythical America that was once great; why should Biden not promise to make everything O.K. again? If anything, Biden is banking on a lack of faith among Democratic primary voters. Trump’s election left many of them with little confidence that the general electorate could ever look beyond, say, a candidate’s unconventional gender (i.e., female) as they learned the hard way in 2016. “If this was a normal cycle, Joe would not be running,” said Terry Shumaker, a Concord attorney I met at a backyard reception for Biden in Nashua. Shumaker was wearing a “Biden for President” button that he acquired in 1987 and an official pin from when Shumaker served as President Bill Clinton’s ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago. “If not for Trump, he would still be retired,” Shumaker said. “I think he feels called.” It is frequently pointed out that Biden’s propensity for gaffes presents an even greater peril than in previous races, thanks to a vastly less forgiving social media ecosystem. But in New Hampshire, Biden said a few things that could have made mainstream headlines, and I was surprised that they did not. It made me wonder if he would actually benefit from the permission structure that the current president has enabled through his ability to get away with so much. When a woman in the crowd whom Biden called on fumed about Trump that “he is an illegitimate president in my mind,” Biden replied: “Would you be my vice-presidential candidate? Folks, look, I absolutely agree.” Not long ago — five years or so — a former vice president signing on to the idea that the current president is “illegitimate” might have been a rather large deal. In 2019, barely anyone noticed — or they noticed much less than they did a few weeks later when the speaker of the House reportedly said she would like to see the president of the United States in prison. It made me think of something that Marianne Williamson used to talk about when she was running for Congress in 2014, about how things that used to be considered exotic have now been incorporated into the political mainstream. “Today that fringe is baked into the cake,” Williamson told me. She might revile Donald Trump, but she also owed him for this much: In 2020, no candidate, and no idea, can safely be counted out. This is something Williamson could point out from the Democratic debate stage. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of bills Amy Klobuchar has sponsored or contributed to that became law under President Trump. It is 34, not six.",The New York Times
2019,25 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘ART AFTER STONEWALL, 1969-1989’ at Grey Art Gallery (through July 20) and at Leslie-Lohman Museum (through July 21). For this summer’s half-century anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall riots, substantial displays of art produced in the long wake of the uprising are filling New York City museums and public spaces. The largest is this two-part exhibition, organized by Jonathan Weinberg and shared by Grey Art Gallery at N.Y.U. and Leslie-Lohman Museum. The Leslie-Lohman half, which focuses on the 1970s and has lots of archival matter, feels tight and combustible. Much of what’s in it was hot off the political burner, responsive to crisis conditions. The pace at Grey, where much of the work dates from the 1980s, is more measured, but has tensions of its own as the story encompasses AIDS and the culture wars. (Holland Cotter)212-998-6780, greyartgallery.nyu.edu212-431-2609, leslielohman.org ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘AUSCHWITZ. NOT LONG AGO. NOT FAR AWAY’ at the Museum of Jewish Heritage (through Jan. 3). Killing as a communal business, made widely lucrative by the Third Reich, permeates this traveling exhibition about the largest German death camp, Auschwitz, whose yawning gatehouse, with its converging rail tracks, has become emblematic of the Holocaust. Well timed, during a worldwide surge of anti-Semitism, the harrowing installation strives, successfully, for fresh relevance. The exhibition illuminates the topography of evil, the deliberate designing of a hell on earth by fanatical racists and compliant architects and provisioners, while also highlighting the strenuous struggle for survival in a place where, as Primo Levi learned, “there is no why.” (Ralph Blumenthal) 646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org ‘CAMP: NOTES ON FASHION’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 8). Inspired by Susan Sontag’s famous 1964 essay, “Notes on ‘Camp,’” the latest spectacular from the Met’s Costume Institute attempts to define this elastic, constantly evolving concept, which leaves taste, seriousness and heteronormativity in the dust. The show researches camp’s emergence in 18th-century France and 19th-century England, examines “Sontagian Camp” and culminates in an immense gallery of designer confectionaries from the 1980s to now that calls to mind a big, shiny Christmas tree barricaded with presents. (Roberta Smith) 212-535-7100, metmuseum.org ‘LEONARD COHEN: A CRACK IN EVERYTHING’ at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 8). The curators of this show, John Zeppetelli of the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen. Some are simple and quiet, like “Ear on a Worm” from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in the space that shows a perched bird, a reference to “Bird on the Wire” from Cohen’s 1969 album “Songs From a Room.” Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok’s “Passing Through,” which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer’s body changes with time. Taken together, the layered work on display has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation. (Mark Richardson) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘CYCLING IN THE CITY: A 200-YEAR HISTORY’ at the Museum of the City of New York (through Oct. 6). The complex past, present and future roles of the bicycle as a vehicle for both social progress and strife are explored in this exhibition. With more than 150 objects — including 14 bicycles and vintage cycling apparel — it traces the transformation of cycling’s significance from a form of democratized transportation, which gave women and immigrants a sense of freedom, to a political football that continues to pit the city’s more than 800,000 cyclists against their detractors today. (Julianne McShane)212-534-1672, mcny.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘LOVE & RESISTANCE: STONEWALL 50’ at New York Public Library (through July 13). Organized by Jason Baumann, this archival show functions as a timeline of the gay movement from the founding of the Mattachine Society in the 1950s through Stonewall and its immediate aftermath. Pictures by Diana Davies and Kay Tobin Lahusen, lesbian photojournalists, mark a forward path that is lined with protest posters, dance club fliers and L.G.T.B.Q. publications (Transvestia, Demi-Gods, Third World Women’s Gayzette). (Cotter) 917-275-6975, nypl.org ‘NOBODY PROMISED YOU TOMORROW: 50 YEARS AFTER STONEWALL’ at Brooklyn Museum (through Dec. 8). In this large group show, 28 young queer and transgender artists, most born after 1980, carry the buzz of Stonewall resistance into the present. Historical heroes, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, are honored (in a film by Sasha Wortzel and Tourmaline). Friends in life, Johnson and Rivera are tutelary spirits of an exhibition in which a trans presence, long marginalized by mainstream gay politics, is pronounced in the work of Juliana Huxtable, Hugo Gyrl, Amaryllis DeJesus Moleski and Elle Pérez (who is also in the current Whitney Biennial). (Cotter)718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org ‘OCEAN WONDERS: SHARKS!’ at the New York Aquarium (ongoing). For years, the aquarium’s 14-acre campus hunkered behind a wall, turning its back to the beach. When aquarium officials last year finally got around to completing the long-promised building that houses this new shark exhibit, maybe the biggest move, architecturally speaking, was breaking through that wall. The overall effect makes the aquarium more of a visible, welcoming presence along the boardwalk. Inside, “Ocean Wonders” features 115 species sharing 784,000 gallons of water. It stresses timely eco-consciousness, introducing visitors to shark habitats, explaining how critical sharks are to the ocean’s food chains and ecologies, debunking myths about the danger sharks pose to people while documenting the threats people pose to sharks via overfishing and pollution. The narrow, snaking layout suggests an underwater landscape carved by water. Past the exit, an outdoor ramp inclines visitors toward the roof of the building where the Atlantic Ocean suddenly spreads out below. You can see Luna Park in one direction, Brighton Beach in the other. The architectural point becomes clear: Sharks aren’t just movie stars and aquarium attractions. They’re also our neighbors — as much a part of Coney Island as the roller coasters and summer dreams. (Michael Kimmelman)718-265-3474, nyaquarium.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘PLAY IT LOUD: INSTRUMENTS OF ROCK & ROLL’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 1). Presented in collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, this exhibition offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and ’70s sits firmly at the center. The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section and another showcasing “Guitar Gods.” Yet another room has a display highlighting the guitar’s destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend. To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for “Creating a Sound,” which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics. The lighting in “Play It Loud” is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it’s catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn’t diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty. (Richardson) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘CHARLOTTE POSENENSKE: WORK IN PROGRESS’ at Dia Art Foundation in Beacon, N.Y. (through Sept. 9). This Hudson Valley institution continues its satisfying enlargement of its roll call of Miminalists and Conceptualists with a major showcase of this German artist, who showed her modular, industrially inspired sculptures alongside Donald Judd and Frank Stella in the late 1960s, but then abandoned art for sociology. Posenenske’s most important works were free-standing pipes, made of sheet steel or cardboard, that look almost exactly like commercial air ducts. Unlike some of the control freaks whose art is also on view here, Posenenske made her art in infinite editions, out of parts that can be arranged in any shape you like: a generous distribution of authorship from the artist to her fabricators and collectors. (Farago)diaart.org ‘PUNK LUST: RAW PROVOCATION 1971-1985’ at the Museum of Sex (through Nov. 30). This show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: The 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream. In the story told by “Punk Lust,” much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show’s curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical — underage groupies cavorting with rock stars — images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation. (Richardson) 212-689-6337, museumofsex.com ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org STATUE OF LIBERTY MUSEUM on Liberty Island (ongoing). Security concerns stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks led the National Park Service to restrict the number of people who could go inside the Statue of Liberty’s massive stone pedestal and up to the crown. So the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation wanted to offer something more for visitors who found the outdoor view less than satisfying: a stand-alone museum on the island that would welcome everyone who wanted to hear the story behind Lady Liberty. Going beyond the vague and often dubious ideal of American “liberty,” the museum’s displays highlight the doubts of black Americans and women who saw their personal liberties compromised on a daily basis in the 1880s, when the statue opened. These exhibits also spotlight a bit of history that is often forgotten: that the French creators intended the statue as a commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the United States. (Julia Jacobs) statueoflibertymuseum.org ‘STONEWALL 50 AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY’ (through Sept. 22). For its Stonewall summer, the society offers a bouquet of three micro-shows. One is devoted to relics of L.G.B.T.Q. night life, from the 1950s lesbian bar called the Sea Colony to the gay male sex clubs like the Anvil and the Ramrod that sizzled in the 1970s. Another documents the founding in 1974 — by Joan Nestle, Deborah Edel, Sahli Cavallero, Pamela Olin and Julia Stanley — of a compendious and still-growing register of lesbian culture called the Herstory Archives. And a third turns a solo spotlight on charismatic individuals: Storme DeLarverie (1920-2014), Mother Flawless Sabrina/Jack Doroshow (1939-2017), Keith Haring (1958-90) and Rollerena Fairy Godmother. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘TOO FAST TO LIVE, TOO YOUNG TO DIE: PUNK GRAPHICS, 1976-1986’ at the Museum of Arts and Design (through Aug. 18). Many of the objects on display in this exhibition were first hung in record stores or in the bedrooms of teenagers. Posters promoting new albums, tours and shows are mixed in with album art, zines, buttons and other miscellany. Most of the pieces are affixed to the walls with magnets and are not framed, and almost all show signs of wear. The presentation reinforces that this was commercial art meant for wide consumption, and the ragged edges and prominent creases in the works make the history feel alive. (Richardson) 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘2019 WHITNEY BIENNIAL’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 22). Given the political tensions that have sent spasms through the nation over the past two years, you might have expected — hoped — that this year’s biennial would be one big, sharp Occupy-style yawp. It isn’t. Politics are present but, with a few notable exceptions, murmured, coded, stitched into the weave of fastidiously form-conscious, labor-intensive work. As a result, the exhibition, organized by two young Whitney curators, Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta, gives the initial impression of being a well-groomed group show rather than a statement of resistance. But once you start looking closely, the impression changes artist by artist, piece by piece — there’s quiet agitation in the air.

With the Stonewall Inn now a National Historic Landmark (and a bar again; it was a bagel shop in the 1980s), nearby New York University has produced a homegrown archival exhibition at Bobst Library, across the park from Grey Art Gallery. Organized by Hugh Ryan, it takes the local history of queer identity back to the 19th century with documents on Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952), an American actor, suffragist and friend of Virginia Woolf, and forward with ephemera related to the musician and drag king Johnny Science (1955-2007) and the African-American D.J. Larry Levan (1954-92), who, in the 1980s, presided, godlike, at a gay disco called the Paradise Garage, which was a short walk from the campus. (Cotter) 212-998-2500, library.nyu.edu ‘JEFF WALL’ at Gagosian (through July 26). Rumination and risk-taking, in equal measure, mark this conceptual photographer’s spellbinding new exhibition. The show, Wall’s first at this Chelsea gallery since ending a 25-year run with the rival dealer Marian Goodman, feels decidedly introspective. Figures alone in contemplative trances, or alienated from their partners in scenes of evident tension, define most of the works. The encyclopedic visual literacy that has long characterized Wall’s pictures (with their compositional echoes of old master paintings) has been pared back, allowing more psychological complexity to emerge. Just as new is an emphasis on narrative and sequence; among the pieces are two diptychs and an enveloping, cinematic triptych. (Karen Rosenberg) 212-741-1717, gagosian.com ‘MAYBE MAYBE NOT: CHRISTOPHER WOOL AND THE HILL COLLECTION’ at the Hill Art Foundation (through June 28). This foundation’s inaugural show presents more than a dozen paintings, works on paper and photographs by Wool, the painter who wrenched abstraction into the No Wave era. In a stenciled painting from 1989, the drippy black letters of the word “SPOKESMAN” are arranged three by three, filling the white aluminum background with the same deductive logic as Frank Stella’s early stripes. After making layered, silk-screened floral patterns in the 1990s, Wool became more gestural; three extraordinary paintings here from the 2000s, with cloudy spray-gun loop-de-loops and merciless erasures, exhibit a simultaneous love and doubt of abstraction that recalls the best of Albert Oehlen. His enthrallingly difficult later silk screens cannibalize his own archive, discordantly remixing earlier works and treating paint as both material and information. (Farago) 212-337-4455, hillartfoundation.org ‘THE SELF-PORTRAIT, FROM SCHIELE TO BECKMANN’ at the Neue Galerie (through June 24). Self-portraiture can seem pretty narrow. But the 70-odd works in this exhibition, which run from a handful of delightfully exact Rembrandt etchings to Felix Nussbaum’s searing 1940 painting “Self-Portrait in the Camp,” ably demonstrate the genre’s universal scope: It’s a consciously constructed illusion of spontaneous self-revelation, a sincere put-on. And as such it’s a peek beneath the hood of art in general. (Will Heinrich) 212-994-9493, neuegalerie.org ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org",The New York Times
2019,"25 Years After O.J. Simpson’s Chase, L.A. Is Still Obsessed With Police Pursuits","California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A quarter-century ago today, much of Los Angeles, and the nation, was transfixed with a white Bronco speeding along the city’s freeways. Four days after Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were murdered in Brentwood, O.J. Simpson was a fugitive. The police pursuit of him that played out on national television became an indelible “where were you when …” cultural moment. Car chases have long been a fixture of the zeitgeist of Los Angeles, a phenomenon that perhaps reached its apex with the O.J. Simpson pursuit and endures today, with near-daily coverage on local television news — often broadcast with footage from helicopters zooming across the skies of the city. Viewers pause, unable to look away from their televisions or their social media feeds. L.A.’s fascination with high-speed pursuits has been the subject of cultural commentary, with writers across the years delving into what it says about the city and its inhabitants. An entertainment lawyer who spoke to The Los Angeles Times several years ago called June 17, 1994, the day of the O.J. chase, in which broadcast networks interrupted an N.B.A. playoff game to show live footage, “the day Los Angeles stopped.” The O.J. chase is sometimes described as the beginning of the city’s obsession with car chases. The Twitter feed @ChaseAlert, which alerts high-speed chases in Los Angeles, recently wrote, “Happy 25th anniversary of the dawn of the car chase!” But Los Angeles Magazine traced the first live police pursuit on local news to 1992, when a station interrupted a rerun of the legal drama “Matlock” to show officers chasing a red Volkswagen driven by a killer. “The police pursuit found its audience,” according to the article. “Over the next decade the car chase — high speed, low speed, or, when a tire has flattened and the fugitive is running on sparks and stupidity, virtually no speed — would become another peculiar symbol of the city, an ‘Only in L.A.’” Geoffrey Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and author of a book on police pursuits, likened the public fascination to watching Nascar. “Thousands of people in a stadium waiting for a crash,” he said. “That’s the fascination.” But Professor Alpert held the O.J. Simpson chase slightly apart from the public’s obsession with highway pursuits. “The O.J. chase was a slow-speed chase,” he said. “It wasn’t your typical high-speed, risky pursuit. It was a celebrity issue.” (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2019,30 Racehorses Have Died at This Track Since Dec. 26,"Breakdowns at Santa Anita A terrible season at Santa Anita produced more than two dozen deaths on the track. A season to remember at Santa Anita Park ended Sunday, one day after American Currency became the 30th horse to die at the historic racetrack since the day after Christmas. The death prompted the owners of what has become one of the deadliest racetracks in America to bar Jerry Hollendorfer, the horse’s Hall of Fame trainer. American Currency died after a training session Saturday. The horse was the fourth trained by Hollendorfer to die at Santa Anita Park since the meeting opened on Dec. 26. “Individuals who do not embrace the new rules and safety measures that put horse and rider safety above all else will have no place at any Stronach Group racetrack,” the company said in a statement. “We regret that Mr. Hollendorfer’s record in recent months at both Santa Anita and Golden Gate Fields has become increasingly challenging and does not match the level of safety and accountability we demand. “Effective immediately, Mr. Hollendorfer is no longer welcome to stable, race or train his horses at any of our facilities.” The turn of events has put pressure on the Stronach Group — which owns the track and several others, including Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore — and the sport at large to enact meaningful measures to ensure safety of its equine athletes and the jockeys who ride them. The spike in fatalities has put a bull’s-eye on the sport. Nearly 10 horses a week on average died at American racetracks in 2018, according to the Jockey Club’s Equine Injury Database. That rate is two and a half to five times greater than in the rest of the horse racing world. Here is a list of the horses that have died at Santa Anita. The New York Times will continue to update it.` June 22 American Currency, a 4-year-old gelding, was injured during training and euthanized. The horse was trained by Jerry Hollendorfer, a Hall of Fame trainer. American Currency was the fourth Hollendorfer-trained horse to die at Santa Anita this season. Mr. Hollendorfer was subsequently banned from Santa Anita June 9 Truffalino, a 3-year-old filly, collapsed in the final stages of the third race on turf. A track spokesman said the horse had died of a heart attack. She was trained by the Hall of Famer Richard Mandella and had one win in six career starts and earnings of $53,602. June 8 Formal Dude was taken off the track by van in the 10th race after breaking down near the finish line. He was subsequently euthanized. Formal Dude, a 4-year-old gelding trained by Phil D’Amato, was winless in six career starts and had earnings of $15,127. June 5 Derby River, an unraced 2-year-old colt, sustained a catastrophic shoulder injury while training and had to be euthanized at a nearby clinic. Mike Marten, a spokesman for the California Horse Racing Board, said that a necropsy would be performed and that the death would be included on the Santa Anita list even though Derby River had died at the clinic. May 26 Kochees, a 9-year-old gelding, sustained an injury in a $10,000 claimer, one of the racetrack’s lowest levels, on May 25 and was taken off the track by van. He was euthanized the next day. He was trained and partly owned by Jerry Hollendorfer, a Hall of Famer. After being sold at a 2-year-old auction for $120,000 in 2012, Kochees was in 49 races, winning 11 times and earning more than $245,000 in purses. May 20 Spectacular Music, ridden by Jorge Velez, pulled up in the backstretch after leaving the gate in a $25,000 claiming race on May 19. He was taken away with an apparent pelvis injury, and euthanized the next morning. May 17 Commander Coil, a 3-year-old gelding, was euthanized after sustaining a shoulder injury while training. He was trained by Marcelo Polanco. March 31 Arms Runner, a 5-year-old gelding, fell in a race, sustaining a catastrophic injury to his right front leg that led him to be euthanized. He was trained by Peter Miller and was sold at a 2-year-old in training sale for $525.000. Two days before Arms Runner was fatally injured, the track had reopened after a nearly monthlong shutdown in response to the equine deaths. March 14 Princess Lili B broke her front legs while training. Trained by David Bernstein, she was a 3-year-old filly. She was not bought at auction. March 5 Let’s Light the Way died during a morning workout. The 4-year-old filly won once in four races for the Hall of Fame trainer Ron McAnally. She was bought for $15,000 as a yearling. March 2 Eskenforadrink died during a $16,000 claiming race of one mile. The 4-year-old filly had won two of her 12 lifetime races for the trainer Jorge Gutierrez. She was bought for $15,000 in 2016. Feb. 25 Charmer John died after a timed workout on the main track. The 3-year-old gelding had run only once for the trainer Mark Glatt. Charmer John was bought for $36,000. Feb. 23 Battle of Midway died after a timed workout. In 2017, he was third in the Kentucky Derby and won the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile. He had been retired as a stallion but was ineffective getting mares pregnant. Battle of Midway returned to the racetrack and, three weeks earlier, had won the San Pasqual Stakes at Santa Anita.

2019,2nd Benghazi Suspect Is Convicted on 2 Counts Amid Signs of Deadlock on Others,"WASHINGTON — A Libyan man was found guilty on Thursday on two terrorism-related charges arising from the attack on a United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi in 2012 that killed two Americans, including the ambassador to Libya, and became a political flash point. But the jury in Washington remained deadlocked on 15 other charges against the man, Mustafa al-Imam, and the Federal District Court judge overseeing the trial ordered jurors to keep deliberating on the remaining counts. Those included aiding and abetting several murders and aiding the follow-up attack, hours later, on a nearby C.I.A. “annex” facility, during which two more Americans were killed. Regardless of what the jurors decide on those counts, the guilty verdict on at least two charges — conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and aiding in the malicious destruction of American property — means Mr. al-Imam is virtually guaranteed a lengthy prison sentence. He became the second suspect to be tried successfully in federal court in Washington for a role in the deadly assaults, which took on broader significance as Republicans and conservative news outlets seized on them to try to damage the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state. Ahmed Abu Khattala, a former militia leader in Benghazi and a friend of Mr. al-Imam’s, was convicted in 2017 on similar charges and sentenced to 22 years in prison. But both cases experienced turbulence: The jury in Mr. Khattala’s case acquitted him of 14 charges, including several counts of murder, the same charges that the jury in Mr. al-Imam’s case has struggled to reach agreement over. That rocky experience underscores the difficulty in bringing foreign terrorism suspects captured under battlefield conditions to the United States for prosecution under civilian-court standards, raising the question of whether the government will seek to apprehend and bring back any more of the dozen or more suspects it has identified from the attacks. Mr. al-Imam was captured by American commandos about a month before the verdict in Mr. Khattala’s case. On the night of the Benghazi attacks, on Sept. 11, 2012, armed men overran the diplomatic compound and set it ablaze. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and another State Department employee, Sean Smith, were killed. Hours later, militants attacked the nearby C.I.A. base with mortars and small-arms fire. Two C.I.A. security contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, were killed, and others were wounded. In 2017, American commandos and members of the F.B.I.’s elite Hostage Rescue Team apprehended Mr. al-Imam in Libya and brought him aboard an American warship, where he was questioned. Mr. Khattala was captured in Libya in 2013 by a similar American force, demonstrating the eagerness of the United States to hunt down those involved. Mr. al-Imam and Mr. Khattala, who were close friends, traveled to the diplomatic compound on the evening of the attack. The defense argued that Mr. al-Imam was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but prosecutors said he intended to commit deadly violence. “When they’re going armed and ready and with the military-style vehicle with Abu Khattala to the U.S. Embassy,” the defendant “knows exactly what he’s doing,” Karen Patricia Seifert, a prosecutor, told the jury during closing arguments this month. “That’s when he’s joining the conspiracy, right at that moment. He knows where they’re going. He knows they’re going armed.” Mr. al-Imam was one of the men filmed entering and leaving the diplomatic compound the night of the attack, and he stole materials from it, including a map that prosecutors said he suspected had intelligence value. Phone records indicated that during the attack, Mr. al-Imam spoke several times with Mr. Khattala; prosecutors argued that this was a sign they were coordinating and said Mr. al-Imam wanted to attack the compound because he believed it was a spy base. Prosecutors pointed to what they described as incriminating comments he made while being questioned by the F.B.I. aboard the warship. He told agents: “I know why I’m here. It’s because of Khattala.” During closing arguments, Ms. Seifert said Mr. al-Imam “had consciousness of guilt even then.” “He knew what he had done,” she said, “he knew who he had associated with, and he knew his associates had perpetrated these attacks together with his assistance.” Mr. al-Imam’s defense lawyer, Matthew J. Peed, said his client was just a convenience store worker and devoted family man who happened to go to the compound on the night of the attack. His client played no role in it, Mr. Peed maintained, and like others simply went to the compound to see what was happening. His lawyers also sought to play down the evidence against him, dismissing his apparently frequent phone communications with Mr. Khattala during that period. “A friendship is not a conspiracy,” Mr. Peed told the jury. Defense lawyers had tried previously to suppress the comments Mr. al-Imam made to F.B.I. agents while aboard the Navy warship. His lawyer contended he been suffering from seasickness mental trauma. But Judge Christopher R. Cooper of the Federal District Court in Washington rejected the argument and permitted prosecutors to use that evidence. Lawyers in the case also called as a witness David D. Kirkpatrick, a correspondent for The New York Times who interviewed many people in Benghazi about the attack in its aftermath. In an article published at the end of 2013, Mr. Kirkpatrick reported that a friend of Mr. Khattala’s had sought to exonerate him by offering an account of a phone call with him during the attack. The article also noted that several witnesses to the attack had contradicted the friend’s account. The same friend, Bilal Al-Ubaydi, now using a pseudonym for his safety, testified in the case as a witness for the prosecution. A lawyer for the defendant called Mr. Kirkpatrick to the stand in an effort to discredit the friend’s current testimony by contrasting it with his earlier account of the phone call. Mr. Kirkpatrick provided his testimony via a video link from the American Embassy in London and was limited to confirming the accuracy of the report in the 2013 article about the attack. For the F.B.I., capture and prosecution of Mr. al-Imam was considered a victory. Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, did not believe that suspected terrorists should be prosecuted in civilian courts yet allowed the Libyan to be brought to the United States for trial. During the same period when Mr. al-Imam was captured and brought to domestic soil for prosecution, Mr. Sessions had refused to bring back a suspected Qaeda operative, a Sudanese citizen known as Abu Khaybar, to face charges in New York. He has been held in Yemen for more than two years by United Arab Emirates authorities.",The New York Times

All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies. GRIT AND GLITTER: BEFORE AND AFTER STONEWALL at the Museum of the Moving Image (June 21-July 6). In their documentary “The Gospel of Eureka” (screening on Saturday), the filmmakers Donal Mosher and Michael Palmieri locate a tenuous common ground between evangelical Christians and drag queens in an Arkansas town. Mosher and Palmieri programmed this retrospective, timed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. The lineup runs the gamut from pre-Stonewall films that were controversial for their portrayals of sexuality (Jack Smith’s “Flaming Creatures,” a pansexual cornucopia that opens the series on Friday alongside two shorts by George Kuchar, was the subject of a censorship clash) to more recent work like Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s “Tropical Malady” (on June 29 and 30), in which a flirtation gives way, after a mid-film rupture, to something mythic. 718-784-0077, movingimage.us PRISON IMAGES: INCARCERATION AND THE CINEMA at Anthology Film Archives (through July 8). Even a majority of the dramatized films in this series take their cues from real-life prison experiences. Critics have ascribed the authenticity of Robert Bresson’s “A Man Escaped” (on Friday and July 2) to the director’s memory of being a prisoner of war. Don Siegel is represented with “Escape From Alcatraz” (on Saturday, Wednesday and June 28) and “Riot in Cell Block 11” (on Friday and Wednesday), which he shot at Folsom State Prison in California; far from being menaces to society, the rioting prisoners, who demand more humane treatment, fit right in with the eventual “Dirty Harry” director’s gallery of authority-flouting heroes. In some ways, “Cell Block,” inspired by real riots, anticipates Cinda Firestone’s “Attica” (on June 30 and July 8), a documentary account of the uprising at Attica Correctional Facility in 1971 and its fallout. 212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] QUEER KINO at the Quad Cinema (June 21-27). A collaboration with Goethe-Institut, this Pride Month series focuses on the emergence of gay-themed German cinema in the 1970s and ’80s, an era and a milieu over which the director Rainer Werner Fassbinder remains a towering figure. “Fox and His Friends” (on Saturday) stars Fassbinder himself as an openhearted carnival worker who, after winning the lottery, is progressively fleeced by members of a mendacious upper crust. Fassbinder’s last feature, “Querelle” (on Saturday and Tuesday), an abrasive and distancing adaptation of Jean Genet’s novel, is one of his boldest films visually, shot against studio backdrops and in the wide-screen dimensions of CinemaScope — a rarity for the director, who favored claustrophobic framings. Beyond Fassbinder, the program features “Coming Out” (on Monday), billed as the first movie from East Germany on the subject of homosexuality — and, given its reported premiere in November 1989, when Communist leaders announced the opening of the Berlin Wall, presumably the last. 212-255-2243, quadcinema.com",The New York Times
2019,"3 New Policies From the 2020 Democrats: Policing, L.G.B.T. Rights and Voting Rights","With 23 candidates in the Democratic presidential race, it can be hard to keep track of their policy proposals. This week alone, we’ve covered Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s climate change plan, Cory Booker’s housing plan and Elizabeth Warren’s economic plan in depth. But we’re also trying a new approach: a weekly roundup of proposals you might have missed. Here are three other plans the 2020 candidates have rolled out since last Saturday. Mr. Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, released a plan on Monday to combat racial bias in policing, including in shootings by police officers. Among other things, the plan — which you can read in full here — would create federal regulations requiring officers to “identify themselves, issue a verbal warning, and give the suspect a reasonable amount of time to comply before the use of force,” and forbid deadly force “unless there is an imminent threat to the life of another person, and all other reasonable alternatives have been exhausted.” It would also expand the use of body cameras for officers; end the use of so-called broken windows policing, which targets minor offenses; and encourage the creation of civilian oversight boards. The plan calls on Congress to pass a bill forbidding law enforcement “to engage in racial profiling or to conduct stops and searches of people with only vague explanations of suspicion,” as well as legislation “to lower the unfairly high burden to prosecute police officers for misconduct.” And it includes a pledge from Mr. Castro to demilitarize the police through an executive order that would prohibit the transfer of military weapons, vehicles and other equipment to police departments. Mr. Castro also wants to create a national database of police officers who have been decertified in a city or state (usually, that means they can no longer work as officers there because of misconduct). Other departments would be urged to use the database in making hiring decisions. Senator Gillibrand, of New York, released a proposal last Saturday to expand rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans. You can read the full plan here. She pledged to instruct the Justice Department to make gender identity and sexual orientation protected classes, and to hire lawyers “to focus specifically and exclusively on eradicating anti-L.G.B.T.Q. discrimination.” And she urged Congress to codify same-sex marriage rights, currently guaranteed by the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Ms. Gillibrand also called for legislation to ban “conversion therapy,” which seeks to change people’s sexual orientation, and to repeal the Food and Drug Administration’s policy prohibiting gay men from donating blood. The plan includes several proposals specific to transgender and nonbinary people: the addition of a third gender option, “X,” on government identification; a reversal of President Trump’s ban on transgender people in the military; a reinstatement of Obama-era guidance stating that public schools should let transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice; and a pledge to ensure insurance coverage for transition-related treatments. It also calls for more funding for mental health programs, H.I.V. and AIDS research and treatment, and efforts to prevent bullying, as well as more resources for the Justice Department to prosecute hate crimes. Mr. O’Rourke’s proposal, released on Wednesday and available in full here, aims to increase turnout by registering tens of millions of new voters and removing obstacles to voting. The plan is divided into three parts, with the main goals of increasing participation, making it easier to vote and combating foreign interference in elections. The first section calls for automatic voter registration when a citizen interacts with any government office, as well as same-day voter registration and preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds. (The voting age would not be lowered; the proposal is to allow teenagers to register early so that they are already on the rolls when they turn 18.) Mr. O’Rourke, a former representative from Texas, would also impose 12-year term limits on members of Congress and 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices. The second section urges Congress to pass legislation that would, essentially, undermine state voter ID laws by allowing people without identification to sign a statement swearing to their identity, as well as legislation to prohibit states from canceling voter registrations solely on the basis of inactivity and to strengthen the Voting Rights Act. It would also make Election Day a national holiday and expand both early and absentee voting. The third section calls for an anti-gerrymandering bill, as well as bills that would match campaign contributions under $500 and make those donations tax deductible; forbid political action committees to contribute to campaigns; and prohibit lobbying by former elected officials. On the subject of foreign interference, Mr. O’Rourke suggests federal funding for states “to align their systems with cybersecurity standards, invest in paper ballot systems and perform ‘risk-limiting’ audits to confirm election outcomes.” Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland released a gun violence prevention plan. Ms. Gillibrand released a second plan, this one on legalizing marijuana. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has already released multiple proposals about climate change, released a “global climate mobilization” plan. The self-help author Marianne Williamson released an immigration plan.",The New York Times
2019,30 Racehorses Have Died at This Track Since Dec. 26,"Breakdowns at Santa Anita A terrible season at Santa Anita produced more than two dozen deaths on the track. A season to remember at Santa Anita Park ended Sunday, one day after American Currency became the 30th horse to die at the historic racetrack since the day after Christmas. The death prompted the owners of what has become one of the deadliest racetracks in America to bar Jerry Hollendorfer, the horse’s Hall of Fame trainer. American Currency died after a training session Saturday. The horse was the fourth trained by Hollendorfer to die at Santa Anita Park since the meeting opened on Dec. 26. “Individuals who do not embrace the new rules and safety measures that put horse and rider safety above all else will have no place at any Stronach Group racetrack,” the company said in a statement. “We regret that Mr. Hollendorfer’s record in recent months at both Santa Anita and Golden Gate Fields has become increasingly challenging and does not match the level of safety and accountability we demand. “Effective immediately, Mr. Hollendorfer is no longer welcome to stable, race or train his horses at any of our facilities.” The turn of events has put pressure on the Stronach Group — which owns the track and several others, including Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore — and the sport at large to enact meaningful measures to ensure safety of its equine athletes and the jockeys who ride them. The spike in fatalities has put a bull’s-eye on the sport. Nearly 10 horses a week on average died at American racetracks in 2018, according to the Jockey Club’s Equine Injury Database. That rate is two and a half to five times greater than in the rest of the horse racing world. Here is a list of the horses that have died at Santa Anita. The New York Times will continue to update it.` June 22 American Currency, a 4-year-old gelding, was injured during training and euthanized. The horse was trained by Jerry Hollendorfer, a Hall of Fame trainer. American Currency was the fourth Hollendorfer-trained horse to die at Santa Anita this season. Mr. Hollendorfer was subsequently banned from Santa Anita June 9 Truffalino, a 3-year-old filly, collapsed in the final stages of the third race on turf. A track spokesman said the horse had died of a heart attack. She was trained by the Hall of Famer Richard Mandella and had one win in six career starts and earnings of $53,602. June 8 Formal Dude was taken off the track by van in the 10th race after breaking down near the finish line. He was subsequently euthanized. Formal Dude, a 4-year-old gelding trained by Phil D’Amato, was winless in six career starts and had earnings of $15,127. June 5 Derby River, an unraced 2-year-old colt, sustained a catastrophic shoulder injury while training and had to be euthanized at a nearby clinic. Mike Marten, a spokesman for the California Horse Racing Board, said that a necropsy would be performed and that the death would be included on the Santa Anita list even though Derby River had died at the clinic. May 26 Kochees, a 9-year-old gelding, sustained an injury in a $10,000 claimer, one of the racetrack’s lowest levels, on May 25 and was taken off the track by van. He was euthanized the next day. He was trained and partly owned by Jerry Hollendorfer, a Hall of Famer. After being sold at a 2-year-old auction for $120,000 in 2012, Kochees was in 49 races, winning 11 times and earning more than $245,000 in purses. May 20 Spectacular Music, ridden by Jorge Velez, pulled up in the backstretch after leaving the gate in a $25,000 claiming race on May 19. He was taken away with an apparent pelvis injury, and euthanized the next morning. May 17 Commander Coil, a 3-year-old gelding, was euthanized after sustaining a shoulder injury while training. He was trained by Marcelo Polanco. March 31 Arms Runner, a 5-year-old gelding, fell in a race, sustaining a catastrophic injury to his right front leg that led him to be euthanized. He was trained by Peter Miller and was sold at a 2-year-old in training sale for $525.000. Two days before Arms Runner was fatally injured, the track had reopened after a nearly monthlong shutdown in response to the equine deaths. March 14 Princess Lili B broke her front legs while training. Trained by David Bernstein, she was a 3-year-old filly. She was not bought at auction. March 5 Let’s Light the Way died during a morning workout. The 4-year-old filly won once in four races for the Hall of Fame trainer Ron McAnally. She was bought for $15,000 as a yearling. March 2 Eskenforadrink died during a $16,000 claiming race of one mile. The 4-year-old filly had won two of her 12 lifetime races for the trainer Jorge Gutierrez. She was bought for $15,000 in 2016. Feb. 25 Charmer John died after a timed workout on the main track. The 3-year-old gelding had run only once for the trainer Mark Glatt. Charmer John was bought for $36,000. Feb. 23 Battle of Midway died after a timed workout. In 2017, he was third in the Kentucky Derby and won the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile. He had been retired as a stallion but was ineffective getting mares pregnant. Battle of Midway returned to the racetrack and, three weeks earlier, had won the San Pasqual Stakes at Santa Anita. He was bought for $410,000 as a yearling and was trained by Hollendorfer. Just Forget It died the same day after a timed workout. The 4-year-old gelding was trained by Librado Barocio. Feb. 22 Hot American died after running in a $25,000 waiver claiming race on the turf. The 4-year-old gelding was 1 for 10 lifetime. He was trained by Ryan Hanson.

Feb. 17 Jager Time died after running a four-furlong timed workout on the main track. The 4-year-old colt was unraced and was trained by Jorge Periban. Feb. 6 Comegowithme died after running in a five-and-a-half furlong $50,000 maiden claiming race. The 3-year-old filly was 0 for 5 lifetime and was originally bought for $1,200. She was trained by Antonio Garcia. Feb. 2 Kid Cantina died after the Grade 3 $150,000 Robert Lewis Stakes, a prep race for the Kentucky Derby. He was a $15,000 purchase as a yearling and was trained by Barocio. Jan. 25 Spitfire died after a timed workout on the main track. The 7-year-old gelding won three of his 13 lifetime races. He cost $100,000 as a yearling and was trained by Brian Koriner, who trained last year’s California horse of the year, Spiced Perfection. Jan. 23 Dancing Harbor died during a timed workout. The 4-year-old gelding won once in eight races and was trained by Frank Lucarelli. Jan. 21 Last Promise Kept died after running in the Grade 3 $100,000 Megahertz Stakes, a mile race on the turf. The 5-year-old mare won three of her 12 lifetime races. She was trained by Tom Proctor. Like Really Smart died after running in a $50,000 maiden claiming race over six and a half furlongs. The 5-year-old gelding was bought as a yearling for $5,000. He was trained by Leonard Powell. Jan. 20 Amboseli died after running in the Grade 3 $100,000 Astra Stakes, a one-and-a-half-mile turf race.

Jan. 8 Secret Street died during a five-furlong timed workout. He was an unraced 3-year-old trained by Bruce Headley. Jan. 4 Tank Team died during a race for 3-year-old maidens going six and a half furlongs on the downhill turf course. It was the third career race for the gelding. He was trained by Keith Desormeaux, who won the 2016 Preakness Stakes with Exaggerator. Unusual Angel died in the same race as Tank Team. It was the colt’s fourth career race. He was trained by Alexis Barba. Dec. 30 Psychedelicat died during a $16,000 claiming race that was a mile on the dirt. He won twice in 18 career starts. He cost $90,000 as a yearling and was the first of three horses trained by Hollendorfer to die. An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the person who trained the colt Unusual Angel. She is Alexis Barba, not Barber.",The New York Times
2019,"30 Years After Tiananmen, ‘Tank Man’ Remains an Icon and a Mystery","BEIJING — He has become a global symbol of freedom and defiance, immortalized in photos, television shows, posters and T-shirts. But three decades after the Chinese Army crushed demonstrations centered on Tiananmen Square, “Tank Man” — the person who boldly confronted a convoy of tanks barreling down a Beijing avenue — is as much a mystery as ever. In an age of cyber-sleuthing and intense media scrutiny, it has become almost impossible for historical figures to remain anonymous. But 30 years later, Tank Man is still a source of enduring fascination and intrigue. Tank Man was photographed on June 5, 1989, in the immediate aftermath of a deadly government campaign to clear Tiananmen Square of protesters. Many of the images of the crackdown showed the streets of Beijing engulfed in carnage and chaos, but the image of Tank Man — a lonely figure in a crisp white shirt, clutching two shopping bags, standing defiantly before hulking armored vehicles — stood out. Photographers and videographers for overseas news outlets captured the standoff from the balconies of a nearby hotel, as the tanks tried to maneuver around Tank Man and came close to running him over. Images of the encounter became some of the most recognized photographs of the 20th century. The sense of mystery has contributed to the popularity of Tank Man, experts say, allowing people to project their own hopes and convictions onto him. “It is Tank Man’s mystery that enables his enduring presence — that permits him to be a code for so many Western values and desires,” said Jennifer Hubbert, an associate professor at Lewis & Clark College who has written about him. Chinese propaganda officials once used the image of Tank Man to defend the government’s handling of the protests, arguing that the military had shown restraint by not killing him. But more recently, the government has worked to eliminate the memory of Tank Man, censoring images of him online and punishing those who have evoked him. A court convicted four men in southwestern China this year for selling bottles of liquor that referenced him, alongside the words, “Never forget, never give up.” As a result of the government’s campaign, many people in China, especially younger Chinese, do not recognize his image. A recent survey of 239 internet users in China by Rutger van der Hoeven, a lecturer at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, found that 37 percent of respondents said they recognized a photo of Tank Man, compared with 49 percent on average across the globe. In a separate question, about one in six Chinese respondents correctly identified the protests at Tiananmen Square as the backdrop for the photo. Outside China, Tank Man has endured in popular culture, the subject of books, documentaries, television shows and art exhibits. “Chimerica,” a recent British series, featured a plot about an American photojournalist on a mission to find the mystery figure. The German company Leica Camera drew criticism from Chinese internet users after a film promoting Leica cameras emerged this spring that recreated the scene of a photographer capturing images of Tank Man. (Leica says it did not commission the film.) In Taiwan, Tank Man has inspired an inflatable art display outside the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei. The display shows a giant green tank pointing its gun directly at a man in black pants and a white shirt. The display is part of an exhibit titled “Back to Tiananmen: Memory as a Form of Resistance” by Shake, a Taiwanese artist. In an interview, Shake, who goes by only one name, said that in Taiwan, Tank Man represents not only the Tiananmen massacre but also the continuing threat of military invasion by Beijing. “Everyone would think if they have the same courage to resist when they learn the story of Tank Man,” she said. The fate of Tank Man has been a subject of wide debate. Some believe that he was most certainly executed in the days following his act of disobedience. Others have argued he might have been saved and could be in hiding. Former President Jiang Zemin suggested in an interview in 1990 that he had not been killed. The police and the city of Beijing did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the man’s identity and whereabouts. Yang Jianli, a Tiananmen protester who is now a rights activist based in the United States, has circulated a petition recently calling on President Xi Jinping to disclose what happened to Tank Man. Mr. Yang described Tank Man as a “symbolic, final act of defiance, the last tragic gesture” in the Tiananmen protests. “Only the Chinese regime knows what became of him,” Mr. Yang said. “It has the responsibility to be transparent about the truth not only about the Tank Man, but the whole truth about the Tiananmen incident.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article described incorrectly a film that recreated the scene of a photographer capturing images of a man confronting tanks during the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. While the film was promoting Leica cameras, the company says it did not commission the film.",The New York Times
2019,34 Ice Cream Trucks Towed in Midtown ‘Operation Meltdown’,"The spectacle left a dessert desert in the streets and marked a new chapter in the turf wars over New York parking. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] As for many businesses, Midtown Manhattan is the big leagues for ice cream trucks, with streets full of sweet-toothed tourists willing to pay New York City prices for cones. But parking in Midtown is nearly nonexistent, so the ice cream trucks routinely pull into illegal spots and then rack up countless tickets. On Wednesday, the city launched a major crackdown, towing away dozens of trucks and accusing their owners of owing $4.5 million in fines for roughly 22,500 unpaid parking and traffic violations. The striking spectacle left a steamy Midtown in a temporary ice cream freeze-out and marked a new chapter in the city’s rich history of crackdowns over coveted Manhattan street-vending spots. Ice cream vendors and other food trucks routinely park illegally and simply absorb tickets as the cost of doing business. But numerous ice cream vendors — who owned or operated 76 trucks — worked out a strategy to dodge paying tickets for running red lights, using bus lanes and parking in crosswalks and in front of fire hydrants, city officials said. In a civil complaint filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the city cited outstanding fines from scofflaw operators who did business under corporations with sweet-sounding names that read like a family ordering dessert. Candie Land Ice Cream Inc. Ice Boyz. Ice Mania. Twirly Twirl Ice Inc. Twist Ice Cream Inc. Very Berry Ice Inc. Behind the sugary names were corporations created as shell companies to hide assets from city finance officials seeking to collect overdue fines. By constantly changing companies, operators could continue to re-register their trucks while eluding city officials. The truck owners “sought to evade enforcement of our traffic laws through an elaborate shell game, transferring ownership of their ice cream trucks between and among dozens of phony companies, effectively shielding their trucks from fines and seizure,” said Zachary W. Carter, the city’s corporation counsel. The legal complaint released on Wednesday read like an ice-cream vendor crime wave, complete with a map of midtown, speckled with red dots appearing like sprinkles, to indicate summons locations. City officials also released images of ice cream trucks operating illegally in bus lanes and in no-standing zones in front of Manhattan landmarks like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lincoln Center, Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick’s Cathedral. In all, 34 of the 46 “worst offenders” were towed on Wednesday morning; the other 12 vehicles are being sought, officials said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the crackdown “marks the end of the road for these scofflaw ice cream vendors.” One truck owner named in the complaint was Dimitrios Tsirkos, who was sued in 2013 by the Mister Softee company for imitating their trucks. Mr. Tsirkos could not be reached for comment, and his lawyers did not returns calls. While operating an ice cream truck in less urban areas may simply mean pulling up to a park, ball field or schoolyard, in Midtown Manhattan it means contending with some of the tightest parking regulations around, an area the legal complaint calls “the most densely congested streets in New York City.” And an area with strict rules for vendor parking — and hawkers and hucksters alike. “No peddler, vendor, hawker or huckster shall permit his car, wagon or vehicle to stand on any street when stopping, standing or parking is prohibited,” city regulations state, according to the Department of Transportation. As the number of food trucks has increased in recent years in Midtown, parking tickets have become a crippling expense for some vendors, said Matthew Shapiro, legal director for the Street Vendor Project, an advocacy group with the Urban Justice Center in Manhattan. He said his group has been unable to get the city to allow food trucks to park in commercial zones, or to designate permissible parking areas. “There’s no viable place for food trucks to park in the city,” Mr. Shapiro said. “The city cracks down on the trucks, but they refuse to look at this issue and find a way to allow these folks to park.” Jeffrey Zucker, a longtime lawyer for Mister Softee, whose trucks were not named by the city as scofflaws, called it common practice for some truck operators to try sidestepping tickets by reincorporating each winter and changing their truck registration. He said Mister Softee requires its franchisees to pay tickets promptly or risk losing the route. “Getting tickets is part of the game in New York City,” Mr. Zucker said, “but you have to pay them.”",The New York Times
2019,"36 Hours in Camden and Rockport, Maine (and Environs)","On the central coast of Maine, visitors will find a beguiling nexus of arts, dining and outdoor activities. If Maine’s much-debated slogan, “the way life should be,” were a place, the towns of Camden and Rockport and their surroundings might be it. On the Eastern Seaboard, where mountains meet ocean, the area has long attracted rusticators and “vacationlanders” who far outnumber residents in summer. These clapboard-and-brick towns sit two miles apart on schooner-spotted harbors next to rounded mountains and sparkling freshwater lakes. What more does a rural getaway need? In this case, it’s a vibrant community of year-round locals who’ve created a nexus of arts, dining and outdoor activities to rival some cities. The area’s charm lies in an authentic belief in family businesses, locally grown food and ingenuity against the odds. Not to mention, they made it through the winter, and summer is everyone’s reward. The Owl & Turtle Bookshop Café in Camden is the place to dish or talk books and coffee with the owners, Craig and Maggie White, and their amiable staff. They’ll wax rhapsodic about the Coffee on the Porch beans, roasted at home by a local teacher and brewed here, or upcoming readings with local authors like the best-selling crime novelist Tess Gerritsen and the children’s book author and illustrator Chris Van Dusen. The former boat shop on Bay View has been renovated to include nooks with chairs and beanbags for relaxing with lattes and books. For those considering a move to the area, grab “Ditch the City and Go Country,” by the local writer-photographer-blogger Alissa Hessler. The view from the top of Mount Battie inspired the words that launched Edna St. Vincent Millay’s career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. “All I could see from where I stood was three long mountains and a wood; I turned and looked the other way, and saw three islands in a bay.” Accessed by a 1.4-mile trail and road, there’s a stone World War I commemorative tower at the top and a hawk’s eye perspective of Camden and the islands of Penobscot Bay. Also visible is Camden Snow Bowl, the community-owned ski mountain that hosts the U.S. National Toboggan Championships every February. Admission ($6) to Camden Hills State Park includes the network of hiking trails, a campground with hookups, plus picnic tables and grills near the rocky shore. Portland may have been Bon Appétit’s 2018 Restaurant City of the Year, but Camden, Rockport and nearby Rockland have significant culinary cred of their own. As far back as 2000, the two-time James Beard Award-winner Melissa Kelly launched the garden-and-greenhouse-to-table formula at Primo, in a charming Victorian in Rockland. Following suit in Rockport, Nīna June restaurant, in a brick and wood-accented venue at historic Union Hall, offers the latest expression of classic Italian-Mediterranean cuisine by the chef and cookbook author, Sara Jenkins. From New York City’s Porsena to her native Maine, she brings her vast knowledge of Italian cuisine to the local-and-fresh theme, evidenced here in, among other dishes, a chive chitarra pasta with Maine crab and lemon butter ($25). Finish up with a nightcap and native oysters at 18 Central Oyster Bar & Grill next door. Both restaurants have coveted outdoor seating and harbor views. Change doesn’t come easily in small towns, as Brian Beggarly, a former chef at Primo, found when he took over Boynton-McKay Food Co., a longstanding locals’ breakfast and lunch joint in downtown Camden’s historic apothecary. The key to success was merging old classics such as skillet eggs and “Wavos Rancheros” with racier tacos and to-die-for brisket hash with potatoes and greens ($9.50). Now old- and new-timers alike fight for the high-backed booths and even begrudgingly enjoy recent décor updates that include a restored 1947 Italian motorcycle on the wall. As an alternative to a schooner, the sea kayak provides affordable and intimate access to the water on one’s own schedule and muscle. Harbor tours with Maine Sport Outfitters depart from the Camden waterfront three times daily, for a two-hour paddle around Curtis Island and the coastline ($45). Maine Sport also offers trips on the freshwater lakes and three- to four-day kayak camping excursions to Stonington and Muscongus Bay. Family-owned by Stuart and Marianne Smith since 1976, the flagship sporting goods store is in Rockport, with a satellite shop in downtown Camden. Kayaks, paddleboards, bikes and canoes are all available to rent by day, week or month from the Rockport location. Bangkok’s loss was Camden’s gain when Ravin Nakjaroen and Paula Palakawong opened Long Grain’s eclectic 30-seat restaurant in 2010. At the time, authentic, locavore Asian food was not quite a thing in lobster country. Now, thanks to the couple’s delightful dishes, i.e. Pad Kee Mao housemade wide rice noodles with local Thai basil, chile, garlic, kale and Heiwa tofu or pork belly ($17), Long Grain is a destination in and of itself. A bright new location has increased square footage to include an Asian market with Long Grain Magic Sauce and other staples, but seating remains limited to 38. Reservations are a must, and walk-ins have better luck at lunch. Check back for vegetarian counter service at the original location come autumn. A scenic byway that leads to a wine-tasting room in a 1790s timber frame barn? It’s not in Napa, but at Cellardoor Winery, where Bettina Doulton has created a bacchanalian playground for wine lovers and casual day-trippers alike at the 5.5-acre vineyard in Lincolnville, about six miles from Camden. The tasting room opens daily at 11 a.m. for samples of the four estate wines by the glass ($8) with cheese boards and complimentary winery tours. Events include pairing lunches on Sundays with local producers, and pop-up dinners with partnering chefs, food trucks and music. The standout is Vino Al Fresco ($175), an open-air dinner with Trillium Caterers, Aug. 15, at a 120-seat table on a platform in the middle of the vines. Annemarie Ahearn of Salt Water Farm has been championing local ingredients and traditional methods at her cooking school since she left New York City for Lincolnville in 2009. Her classes and workshops at the antique post-and-beam barn and stone patio on Penobscot Bay inspire hundreds of attendees to bring new perspectives to the home kitchen. Summer courses include Modern Country Cooking ($185), a three-day French Regional Cuisine Workshop ($545) and the Cookbook Club Series ($185) dinner with special guest, Alison Roman (who writes about food for The New York Times), to sample recipes from her new book, “Nothing Fancy.” Classes sell out quickly, but check the email wait list for cancellations. A starter kit for escaping into the world. Camden’s village is exceptionally walkable, which lends itself to a relaxed or spirited evening on the town. The View, a new rooftop bar at 16 Bay View Hotel, is the place to start with a craft cocktail, small plate and open-air outlook on the bay. Rhumb Line, across the maze of sailboats and schooners at Lyman-Morse at Wayfarer marina, calls out for dinner beside the water. Bryan Romero, the chef, has elevated fish and chips ($17) to delicacy status, along with an exceptional haddock chowder. A full bar and the Something Fierce signature cocktail ($10) means it’s a hard spot to leave, but the walk back to town is rewarded by after-hour specials and a lively vibe at 40 Paper Italian Bistro & Bar in the historic Knox Mill, where friendly locals close out the night over flatbreads and half-price drinks. If a coffee shop gauges community, Rockport is thriving at Seafolk Coffee. Behind a sign-less blue door, the freshly renovated space with a pine-tree slab counter and tall windows is a word-of-mouth favorite and cozy hangout above the harbor. The owners, Jacob and Madrona Wienges, serve espresso and cortado from micro lot beans, as well as housemade pastries and Danish-inspired open-faced toasts on dense rye bread ($9-$12). A photograph by the entrance sets the tone with an ocean scene and Isak Dinesen quote: “The cure for anything is salt water. Sweat, tears, or the sea.” For more photography, come back Monday to Saturday for the acclaimed Maine Media Gallery and Tim Whelan’s photographic book shop up the street. Starting in the 1950s, Alex Katz, Lois Dodd, Neil Welliver and their gang of avant-garde artist friends, notable for their return to realist nature and figure paintings against the tide of Abstract Expressionism, migrated from New York City to Lincolnville’s Slab City Road every summer to make art and relax en plein-air. The Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland celebrates these artists this year with the Slab City Rendezvous exhibition and Maine in America award. Permanent collections include the curious assemblages of the sculptor Louise Nevelson, and a church in back houses the paintings of N.C., Andrew and Jamie Wyeth ($15 adult admission). Look into tours of the Olson House, the iconic Colonial on the hill in Andrew Wyeth’s “Christina’s World.” Designed by the architect Toshiko Mori, who summers on the nearby island of North Haven, the new Center for Maine Contemporary Art is worth a visit for the stunning glass and corrugated metal building alone. The art is pretty great, too. Since its founding in 1952 by the Maine Coast Artists collective, the center has shown works by the Maine-inspired artists Robert Indiana, Fairfield Porter, Louise Nevelson and Alex Katz. A block from the Farnsworth in Rockland, the new space opened in 2016. Summer shows include a Slab City Road veteran, Ann Craven, who brings her serial treatment of time to birds, flowers and the moon. Airbnbs and Vrbos in the area include everything from a double occupancy R-Pod Camper on a farm and a private studio apartment overlooking an apple orchard, to a restored 1840s four-bedroom farmhouse with pick-your-own lettuce, tomatoes, herbs and blueberries in the garden; from $52 to $134 to $499. As far as oceanside resorts go, Samoset Resort (220 Warrenton Street, Rockport) has the bases covered with 230 acres on a point across from Owls Head Lighthouse, plus 178 newly renovated rooms, indoor and outdoor heated pools, fitness club and spa with hot tubs and steam saunas, and an 18-hole golf course. Summer rates start at $379. Despite a guest list boasting a king, president and Edna St. Vincent Millay, Whitehall (52 High Street, Camden) still manages to feel like a classic Maine summer home. Brightly updated in 2015, the rambling clapboard inn, a 10-minute walk from downtown, has 36 rooms and suites, farmer’s porch, bocce court and fire pit.

2019,36 Hours in Majorca,"There’s a quieter side to this breezy island off the coast of mainland Spain. So add mountain villages and inland drives to your to-do list. Northern Europeans love Majorca, the breezy Balearic island about 125 miles off the coast of mainland Spain. An easy weekend getaway for sun-seeking Brits, Germans and Scandinavians, the Mediterranean island and its capital, Palma, are sometimes derided as a cheap package-tour destination for hard-partying holidaymakers. And in July and August — the height of the summer season — this is certainly true. But the rest of the year, you’re as likely to hear accented English as Mallorquí, the local dialect of Catalan. So wander the warren of narrow stone alleyways in Palma’s medieval center, drive inland to explore ancient olive groves and rural mountain villages, and along the way, discover another side of this surprising, sun-baked island. The view from atop the 14th-century Castell de Bellver, about a mile west of the city center, encompasses all of Palma: from the palm-lined harbor to the famed cathedral’s distant spires. Follow this sightline on foot, starting at the harbor, an aquatic parking lot of ostentation where yachts are docked beside megayachts docked beside superyachts. Continue along the sunny harborside promenade for about a mile toward the Catedral de Mallorca, a Gothic cathedral known simply as La Seu. The finest vantage to admire this cliff-top landmark is actually from below, in the Parc de la Mar, a man-made park with a pretty fountain and a large pool reflecting the golden sandstone facade. The whole city strolls the tree-lined Passeig des Born in the hours before dinner, so branch off this wide allée to instead explore the narrow side streets dotted with small shops and art galleries. The Palma branch of Berlin’s Kewenig gallery showcases emerging artists inside a 13th-century oratory, while the Gerhardt Braun Gallery hosts exciting contemporary installations in a 17th-century Mannerist mansion. Colorful Majorcan ceramics — hand-painted platters, sea-blue bowls — can be found at Terra Cuita, the store of an artisan producer in nearby Pòrtol. And don’t miss Galería Pelaires, a gallery with an international bent whose program last year included a dreamy Prudencio Irazábal exhibition. Given the British proclivity for Palma, it’s little surprise that one of the brightest additions to the local dining scene comes courtesy of a London restaurateur. El Camino is a stylish tapas bar that opened last year in a gorgeous space: a narrow room with mosaic-tile floors, coffered ceilings and one long marble counter lined with leather stools. It’s also often full, which makes the standing-only bar tables in the rear, where drinks and snacks are served, an attractive alternative. Claim a spot among the sociable crowd of expats in their finest frippery, and order a few bites: blistered padrón peppers, garlicky fried squid, crisp jamón croquettes and, if you ask nicely, a palm-size Spanish omelet filled with spicy chorizo from the regular menu. To drink, try a glass of Majorcan tinto from Bodega Son Vell, a small winery producing blends with rare indigenous grapes, like callet and fogoneu mallorquí. Dinner for two, about €70, or about $78. End the evening as the Spanish do, with a gin and tonic, the de facto national drink. At Clandestino Cocktail Club, a cozy spot with candlelit tables, a jazzy soundtrack and a solid selection of top-notch spirits behind the bar, you’ll get a proper balloon glass with your gin of choice; jammy Brockmans is always a great pick. Or join local craft beer drinkers for a pint at Lórien, a friendly, no-frills pub nearby where taps recently featured a hazy I.P.A. from Cerveses La Pirata in Catalonia, and a brown ale from Majorca’s Sa Cerviseria brewery. How do you like your breakfast: trendy or classic? For the former, take a seat at a table outside the city’s first specialty coffee shop, La Molienda, on a quiet corner in the Sant Jaume neighborhood. The order here is a velvety cappuccino made with beans from Barcelona-based Right Side Coffee Roasters, a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice, and the delicious pa amb oli de queso — toast drizzled with olive oil and served with Menorcan cheese, sliced apples and local olives (€7.50). Service is friendly but scrambled, so plan to take it slow. Or pursue the historic route, at the original location of Ca’n Joan de s’Aigo, an old-school bakery dating to the 18th century. Amid chandeliers and faded grandeur, opt for a sugar-dusted ensaïmada (€1.40), a traditional snail-shaped Majorcan pastry, and a creamy almond horchata. Majorca is much more than its capital, so hit the road for a more complete picture of the island. Head north out of Palma onto winding two-lane roads that curl into the Serra de Tramuntana, a rugged mountain range (and Unesco World Heritage Site) spanning the northwestern coast. Just outside the pretty village of Valldemossa, stop to explore Son Moragues, a finca, or country estate, founded in the 14th century that was once home to Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria. Today the sprawling property is focused on land conservation, and produces fine organic olive oil from native varieties. Arrange a private tasting and tour of the terraced groves to stroll alongside roaming sheep and marvel at the magnificent mountain views (by reservation only; from €75 per person). Continue north along the scenic coastal road, a snaking drive through the mountains with distractingly good views. Make a pit-stop at Son Marroig, another of the archduke’s former homes, to snap photos of the dramatic coastline. Then roll through the ochre-hued hamlet of Deià en route to the town of Sóller. Nestled in an inland valley, sleepy Sóller springs to life on Saturdays when the streets fill with market stalls selling everything from straw totes to sobrassada. Buy a bag of warm bunyols, small sugarcoated doughnuts, and stroll around Plaza de la Constitución, the sunny main square, where every so often, whistles blare and a vintage wood-paneled tram trundles through, rattling toward the port two-and-a-half miles away. Circle back toward Palma and stop on the outskirts to tour the Fundació Miró Mallorca, a museum on a scenic hillside property where Joan Miró lived and worked during his final decades of life. Start the visit inside the studio designed by the architect Josep Lluís Sert, and then climb to the 18th-century villa where Miró’s charcoal sketches graffiti the walls. Finish in the exhibition hall, where galleries and an outdoor garden display sketches, sculptures and large-scale paintings. Admission, €7.50. A starter kit for escaping into the world. Warmth radiates from Toque de Queda, a casual restaurant, bar and deli squirreled away on an alley in the old town where diners lounge in window niches and sip cava around long communal tables. A former bakery with a centuries-old oven, this rambling locale is today run by a young Italian couple who serve simple tapas based on locally sourced products. Start with an order of pan de cristal con tomate (€5), crisp bread slathered with fresh tomato, and one of the charcuterie boards dedicated to various Mediterranean regions. For little-known local specialties, try the Balearic board, with spicy sobrassada, chunky camaiot, and intense figatella sausages, alongside various cheeses from the neighboring island of Minorca (half-portion, €14). If there exists such a thing as a secret Majorcan beach, don’t expect locals to give it up. But finding an astoundingly beautiful white-sand crescent nestled between dramatic cliffs and turquoise seas is easy, and beating the crowds is simply a matter of timing. At Mondragó Natural Park, about an hour from Palma on the southeast coast, arrive early to explore the protected coves and sheltered dunes surrounded by natural pine groves. Or head farther down the coast to Caló des Moro and hike down a rugged dirt trail to reach an enchanting cove with crystalline water. When the shores swell with sun-seekers, double back to a shady alley in central Palma for a leisurely midday meal at La Rosa Vermutería. Since opening in 2015, this lively restaurant has revived the Spanish tradition of a midday vermouth, which happens to be the perfect aperitif to sip while (inevitably) waiting for a table. Overwhelmed by the two dozen vermouth options? Try the house blend, 5 Pétalos, with its natural pairing, a bowl of marinated olives. Once tucked around a table in the long, narrow dining area, peruse the menu of tapas and conservas (canned seafood). Recent highlights included the croqueton de txuleton (a crisp meat-filled croquette), briny preserved clams and paprika-dusted Galician-style octopus. Lunch for two, about €50. Opened in January, the 99-room Protur Naisa Palma Hotel is on a quiet street just outside the old town with an inviting lobby lounge and restaurant, an indoor pool and spa, and a rooftop pool with sun beds and lounge chairs (Carrer de Simó Ballester, 6; protur-hotels.com; from about €150). On a main boulevard in central Palma, the Nakar Hotel opened in 2016 with interiors that incorporate local materials, like typical Majorcan stone. In addition to 57 neutral-toned rooms, the property also has a restaurant, a spa, an indoor heated pool and a rooftop terrace with an infinity pool and views across the old town (Avenida de Jaume III, 21; nakarhotel.com; from €215). Recent laws have banned most short-term rentals in central Palma, but outside the city, licensed holiday properties are plentiful. Around Sóller, traditional cottages can be found on Airbnb for under $100 a night. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,36 Hours in Oxford,"Scholarly strolls and boozy cruises in the ultimate British college town. Over the centuries, the oldest university in the English-speaking world has had quite an influence on its namesake city, as even visitors here can attest. Wandering through Oxford’s ancient streets, overhearing conversations in a marvelous spectrum of accents — about mathematics and music and the intricacies of Kurdish politics — it’s easy to feel the university rubbing off on you. But there’s much more to Oxford than cloistered academia. With its idyllic natural setting, buzzing restaurant scene and dynamic industries in fields as diverse as publishing, health care and auto manufacturing (the Mini is made here), this more-than-a-thousand-year-old community on the River Thames is as lively, and lovely, as ever. Shrunken heads. Spears. Blowpipes for poison darts. Sure, Oxford has plenty of somber art and artifacts to admire (for those, the Ashmolean is an excellent choice), but don’t skip the peculiar collections of Pitt Rivers, a Victorian-era museum beloved by locals for its vast array of curiosities culled from the farthest reaches of the British Empire, and beyond. Unlike most museums, Pitt Rivers organizes its items not by age or origin, but according to each object’s function (playing cards from across the continents and through the ages, for example), inviting you to draw your own conclusions. Free entry, but donations encouraged. Floating down Oxford’s canals and rivers is both a time-honored pastime and an excellent way to explore the city, especially in the warmer months. As the sun starts to dip, make your way to the boathouse under Magdalen Bridge, where you can rent a punt, a wooden raft perfectly suited for the city’s more tranquil waterways (£22, or about $28, per hour; up to five people per punt). Buy a round of Pimm’s (£4 each) — a classic English summer drink, boozy and fruity and fresh — at the stand next to the boat launch. Then laze your way down the quiet waters along Christ Church Meadow, and do your best not to fall in. It’s easy to walk right past Arbequina, a tapas restaurant that still bears the signage of the “dispensing chemist” that used to occupy this location on Cowley Road. But this small and unobtrusive spot, the sister restaurant to a wildly popular Thai place a bit farther out of town, is well worth seeking out. Find a seat among the young professionals perched along the sleek metal bar and ask the staff for their recommendations from the short-but-sublime menu of small Spanish savory dishes. For dessert, order a slice of the tender-sweet almond cake, the Santiago tart (£5). Dinner with a glass of wine, about £20. Climb the tower of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin (entry to the tower, £4) for the classic view of the city’s “dreaming spires,” then set off on a walking tour of the heart of Oxford academia. Admire the stately facade of the Radcliffe Camera; gaze up at the spectacular painted ceiling of the Sheldonian Theatre (entry £3.50); snap a photo of the famously photogenic Hertford Bridge, better known as the Bridge of Sighs; then join a guided visit of the Bodleian, the university’s principal library. The tour (£6 for half an hour) includes a stop in the 500-year-old Divinity School, a vaulted space with a remarkably intricate ceiling that Harry Potter fans might recognize as the Hogwarts infirmary. Finish with a visit to the recently renovated Weston Library, where rotating (and free) exhibitions highlight modern and ancient treasures from the university’s immense collection. It’s hard not to be inspired by all of that intellectual wealth, so pick up some reading material of your own at Blackwell’s Bookshop, which has been slaking Oxford’s unending thirst for books since 1879. It’s easy to spend an hour or more exploring the store’s three levels, including the rare books section on the top floor. There can’t be many places in the world where you can enjoy an organic, locally sourced lunch in a room that’s nearly 700 years old, but Oxford is certainly one. The line at The Vaults and Garden might snake out the door in the summer, but it’s worth the wait, both for the food — fresh salads, curries, stews and baked treats; the menu changes every day — and the setting: the arch-roofed Old Congregation House, which dates from the 1320s. Lunch for one, about £12. A starter kit for escaping into the world. Locals still frequent Oxford’s Covered Market, open since 1774, to shop for produce, meat, baked goods and fresh flowers, but there’s plenty of enjoyable window shopping to do as well. Peruse the fascinators at The Hat Box; admire the local artwork on display at The Covered Arts; or peer through the large windows of The Cake Shop to watch the bakers laboring over their elaborate confections (and, for £1.90, pick up a cupcake to go while you’re there). Founded in 1621 as a nursery for medicinal plants, Oxford’s Botanic Garden is the oldest in Britain. Today, the fragrant, shady corners of the Walled Garden make a welcome spot for an afternoon snooze, while the Lower-Garden displays on sugar cane, cannabis, vanilla and other “plants that changed the world” will surely deepen your knowledge of horticultural history. Wander through the glass houses to find carnivorous plants, ferns, cactuses and lilies from around the world. Entry, £5.45. The University of Oxford comprises about three dozen colleges, academic communities in which students study, and often live and eat. The colleges — which range in age from roughly 30 years to more than 700 years old — are sometimes open to visitors, who can tiptoe around the leafy quads, solemn chapels and dining halls as the students and professors go about their day. Christ Church College is popular with tourists, but Magdalen College — with its quiet cloister, large deer park and flowery water meadow — is equally impressive (entry, £6). At 6 p.m., make your way to the chapel, where you can hear the celebrated Magdalen College Choir take part in the evening service. (Services are held daily, except Mondays, in term time.) Taking its name from the Lewis Carroll classic, which was written in Oxford, The White Rabbit serves high-end pizzas and beer to a good-natured crowd of students, locals and visitors. Order at the bar, grab a table and pull down a board game from the stack in the corner if you have some time to kill. It can get a little rowdy in the evening, but it’s all part of the fun. Dinner for one, about £15. Walk north to the Jericho Tavern, a laid-back neighborhood pub that offers live music, tasty bar food and a good range of beers on tap. The rock band Radiohead — whose members met as high school students in Abingdon, just south of Oxford — played its first gig here in 1986, and the Jericho continues to feature up-and-coming groups as well as more established acts. For a mellower night out, go next door to The Phoenix Picture House, which offers an intelligent mix of mainstream movies and art house films (£11.60 per ticket). Stretch your legs with a walk across Port Meadow, a wide expanse of grassland and wetland that has served as a grazing area for local livestock for at least a thousand years. Keep an eye out for wild rabbits, wildflowers and water birds as you follow the footpath along the Thames, which traces the Meadow’s western edge. After a couple of miles, you’ll come to the ruins of Godstow Abbey, a former nunnery founded in the 12th century. It was on a boat trip here to Godstow on a summer day in 1862 that Charles Dodgson — an Oxford mathematician better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll — spun a wondrous tale for young Alice Liddell and her sisters, which he published a few years later. Finish your walk in the handsome old village of Wolvercote, which lies at the Meadow’s northern edge. Here you’ll find Jacob’s Inn, where you can indulge in the beloved British tradition of a lavish Sunday lunch, complete with roasted meat and potatoes, a hearty portion of vegetables, crispy-soft Yorkshire puddings and plenty of red wine gravy to top it all off. Ask for a table outside in the large and artfully cluttered garden, where you’ll find goats, chickens and pigs in among the parasols and potted plants. Lunch, about £20. Bookings essential on the weekend. You can hop on the bus back to town. Jericho and Summertown are both friendly neighborhoods within easy reach of the city center. (Walk from Jericho, or take the bus from Summertown.) Airbnb apartment listings in both areas start from about £100 per night; cheaper options are available farther afield. For the student experience, try University Rooms, which rents out empty rooms in Oxford colleges, ranging from £32 to over £100 per person per night. The service runs year-round, but you’ll find more options when classes aren’t in session. For a splurge, try the Old Parsonage Hotel, which offers quiet luxury — a light-filled library, a private garden, elegantly appointed rooms — a short walk from the center. A double room without breakfast starts from £230 per night. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,36 Hours of New York City Pride,"This year’s host of WorldPride offers a calendar packed with activities. So dive right in, but don’t skip some of the lower-key options (and save room for Frito pie). June is Pride month in New York City, a time when it feels like nearly everyone in the five boroughs is a member of the family or a trusted ally. That sense of community will be surpassed this year as New York celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, the night in 1969 when a group of gay, lesbian and transgender people stood up to harassment, and the gay liberation movement was born. Big Apple’s Pride will also feel more international as it becomes the first time the United States is home to WorldPride, whose previous locations include Rome, Jerusalem, London, Toronto and Madrid. There are a multitude of events happening this month, but ultimately pride is personal. How you choose to celebrate is up to you. The events below will not necessarily keep you out until dawn, but they will take a bite out of what New York has to offer this month. “Stonewall 50” is the overarching theme for several exhibitions at the New-York Historical Society, among them “By the Force of Our Presence: Highlights from the Lesbian Herstory Archives,” a collection of photographs, books, posters, clothes and other mementos that seeks to prevent the erasure from history of the many contributions made by lesbians and queer women. The full collection of the Lesbian Herstory Archives is housed in Park Slope and can be visited in person or virtually. Another exhibition, “Say It Loud, Out and Proud: Fifty Years of Pride,” is a march through significant moments in L.G.B.T. history, with photographs of past marches from the 1960s to now. Admission: $13 to $21. [Need some help navigating New York for WorldPride? We’ve got you covered.] The best way to appreciate the city is by walking it, so take some time for a stroll before the next pit stop. You can get an elevated view from the High Line, an abandoned freight line turned into a public space, and walk south toward the Chelsea neighborhood and check out its many galleries, many of which can be found between 19th and 27th streets between 10th and 11th Avenues. Not far away, Team New York Aquatics is hosting this year’s International Gay and Lesbian Aquatics Championships, and as part of that, the New York group is presenting a Q. and A. on Friday, June 28, at 5 p.m. with three out-and-proud Olympians: the Americans Bruce Hayes and Betsy Mitchell, who won gold medals in 1984, and the Australian Daniel Kowalski, who got the gold in 2000. The event will be moderated by Jeff Commings, the author of “Odd Man Out: True Stories of a Gay Black Swimmer,” his autobiography about swimming, his Olympic trials and his struggles with homophobia. Tickets: $10 (and limited to 400 attendees). The bar and restaurant Cowgirl, opened in 1989 by Sherry Delamarter, a native of Texas, is all about comfort and kitsch. Every nook and cranny seems to be adorned with gay flags, checkered tablecloths, tequila bottles and Western memorabilia. There are salad options if you’re trying to be good, but if today is your cheat day, opt for the Frito pie: an open bag of Fritos gloriously topped with chili and all the fixings — jalapeños, Cheddar cheese, sour cream and onions. The veggie version is $8.50, beef is $9.95. Another favorite: artichoke fritters with spinach dip ($10.95). Indulge away, there is exercise ahead. The art collective known as Papi Juice, which caters to queer and trans people of color, was founded in 2013. The Papi Juice World Pride dance party on June 28 in Brooklyn starts at 7 p.m. with a rooftop sunset reception and promises to go until 5 a.m. There will be 15 D.J.s in three rooms at the massive venue Elsewhere in Bushwick. Ticket sales will benefit Landscape, a program for visual artists. Tickets: $30 to $50. You could make a weekend visit out of Central Park by itself. For this trip, start June 29 off with the Front Runners New York LGBT Pride Run. This five-mile run, organized by New York Road Runners and Front Runners New York, an athletic group for L.G.B.T. runners and their allies, has been an annual event since the inaugural outing in 1982 with 440 runners. This year, even more runners can participate in a bid to establish a new Guinness World Record for a charity run. The minimum to beat is 6,000 finishers. This year’s beneficiary is The Center, a resource hub for the L.G.B.T. community, in the West Village. Entries are $15 to $37. The race begins near East 67th Street and heads across the park first north, then west, then south to the finish line near West 71st Street. After a post-run cool down and clean up, enjoy an aerial view of Central Park from Robert, a swanky American restaurant and lounge that is on the ninth floor of the Museum of Arts and Design building at Columbus Circle. There are bold colors, furnishings that recall Don Draper’s apartment in “Mad Men” and many culinary options. Try the pairing of a tomato bisque and grilled cheese ($18) or the caprese sandwich ($18). The Criminal Queerness Festival, which runs through July 6, presents L.G.B.T.Q. theater from around the world. Among the performances is “Jhaanjar Di Paanwaan Chhankaar,” written by Fatima Maan and directed by Nicky Maggio. The play is about a blind man, his controlling mother and his new neighbor in Pakistan. It is adapted from “Butterflies Are Free,” a play by Leonard Gershe set in Manhattan, which earned Blythe Danner a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in 1970. Tickets: $20. The Australian painter Ross Watson counts among his fans two members of the honorary British knighthood: Sirs Elton John and Ian MacKellen. “Hominus Uniformis” is Mr. Watson’s first solo show in New York. On display are several of his works, which look at men — in various states of dress — juxtaposed against some unexpected backdrops. One of the PG-13 paintings shows a golfer, wearing bright red swim trunks and a red cap, planting a flag, but on a beach, instead of a fairway. A starter kit for escaping into the world. The cocktail bar Porchlight is the creation of Mark Maynard-Parisi and Danny Meyer, and it has a passion for hospitality. If you become a frequent visitor, the bartender will try to recall “your usual.” There is an extensive cocktail list, as well as beers, wine and whiskey. The Gun Metal Blue, $18, has Lunazul Tequila, Blue Curaçao, Peach brandy, lime and cinnamon, and a great slogan: “See a blue drink, drink a blue drink.” The best snacks are the warm bourbon bar nuts ($8) and the sugar and spice popcorn ($5). Porchlight bills itself as a nontipping bar where everything is included in the menu prices. “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” through Sept. 8, displays garments from the 17th century through today in an examination of the concept of camp, which can be humorous and theatrical. Picture the concert outfits of Cher or Elton John and you will be in the right frame of mind for these wearable works of art. One of the standouts is Jeremy Scott’s kimono cape for Moschino that looks like the compartments of a TV dinner — vegetable medley on one side; mashed potatoes on the other. After a long day of culture, wind down with a late dinner and cocktails at Bsquared, known for its artisanal pizzas and shareable small plates. Start with a Clemenza ($13), a bourbon drink with smoked maple syrup, and the roasted cauliflower ($14), with a medley of capers, pine nuts and raisins. For the main course, pick whichever pizza name tickles your fancy: Oscar the Grouch ($17), The Becky ($17), Meat Packing ($19) or the Italian Stallion ($20). End with the budino ($8), an Italian chocolate pudding with sea salt, olive oil and whipped cream. Pride is political and not everyone has a seat at the table. The Queer Liberation March on June 30 is a reminder that there are still many battles to be fought at home, across the country and around the world — issues that the Reclaim Pride Coalition, the organizers of this morning march, feel are lost in the Pride March at noon. The coalition’s mission statement includes recognizing the legacy of the Stonewall Rebellion by highlighting the most marginalized members of the community. It kicks off from the Stonewall Inn (53 Christopher Street) and will head up Sixth Avenue to Central Park for a rally on the Great Lawn. Just before the official noon kickoff for the New York City Pride March on June 30, there is a moment of silence at 11:58 a.m. for participants to pause and remember those who lost their lives to AIDS and hate crimes. It is an incredibly powerful moment of reflection, before the loud, colorful parade begins. This year’s marshalls include the Gay Liberation Front, an activist group formed just after the Stonewall Uprising; members of the cast of “Pose”; and Monica Helms, a transgender activist and a veteran of the United States Navy. The march begins at 26th Street and Fifth Avenue and heads south and west before making its way back north to 23rd Street and Seventh Avenue. Happy Pride! The Sofitel New York, 45 West 44th Street, is offering a one-of-a-kind room through Sept. 15. A suite at the hotel has been turned into a celebration of Cher and is adorned with an autographed cast poster of “The Cher Show” on Broadway, original costumes from the production and portraits of the singer by Al Hirschfeld. $499 a night. It does not include the Cher-themed cocktail, Turn Back Thyme. Hell’s Kitchen has a robust bar scene, near all the major Broadway theaters and the heart of the subway system. Airbnb has many options, priced between $169 and $350, in the neighborhood. The Ace Hotel, 20 West 29th Street, is a gay-owned franchise of properties that was founded by Alex Calderwood, Wade Weigel and Doug Herrick in Seattle in 1999. It is about a 10-minute walk from the end of the Pride March. Room rates are around $233 and up. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,Opinion | 4 Disturbing Details You May Have Missed in the Mueller Report,"Some troubling-to-outright-damning episodes have been lost in the noise around its release. Ms. Jurecic is the managing editor of Lawfare. After two years of silence, the special counsel Robert Mueller recently made his first public remarks — to complain, it seemed, that no one had read his report. “We chose those words carefully,” Mr. Mueller said, “and the work speaks for itself.” But at a dense 440-plus pages, if the report speaks for itself, it takes a great deal of time and focus to listen to what it has to say. Mr. Mueller tells a complicated story of “multiple, systematic” efforts at Russian election interference from which the Trump campaign was eager to benefit. And he describes a president eager to shut down an investigation into his own abusive conduct. This is far from, as the president put it, “no collusion, no obstruction.” The document is packed with even more details, ranging from the troubling to the outright damning. Yet these have been lost in the flurry of discussion around the report’s release. Even the most attentive reader could have trouble keeping track of the report’s loose ends and dropped subplots. Here are four of the most surprising details that you might have missed — and none of them are favorable to the president. (Volume I, pp. 52-54) How much did Mr. Trump personally know about Russian efforts to assist his campaign, and when did he know it? Three pages of heavily redacted text provide hints. Rick Gates, a top adviser, said that the campaign was “planning a press strategy, a communications campaign, and messaging based on the possible release” of Hillary Clinton emails by WikiLeaks. After receiving a call during a drive to La Guardia Airport, Mr. Trump “told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming.” The details are redacted, and the redactions are marked “harm to ongoing matter,” perhaps related to the prosecution of Roger Stone. Mr. Mueller has alleged that Mr. Stone, a Trump affiliate, sought to obtain information about WikiLeaks’ planned release of anti-Clinton material and pass that information to the campaign. Mr. Mueller found “insufficient evidence” to charge a criminal conspiracy between the Russian government and the campaign. But the campaign was clearly keeping a close eye on Russia-linked hacking and leaking efforts and expecting to benefit from them. This section suggests that Mr. Trump may have been in the loop on the campaign’s efforts to get a heads-up about what WikiLeaks had planned. And that is a very long way from “no collusion.” (Volume I, pp. 49, 62-63) At a July 27, 2016, campaign rally, Mr. Trump said, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing” — referring to Clinton emails reportedly stored on a personal server. “Within approximately five hours” of Mr. Trump’s remarks, according to the Mueller report, Russian military intelligence began a cyberattack against “Clinton’s personal office.” After his July 27 comment, the report states, Mr. Trump “asked individuals affiliated with his campaign to find the deleted Clinton emails” — including Michael Flynn. Mr. Flynn, in turn, reached out to a Republican Senate staffer and a party operative who worked separately to obtain the emails. The operative raised money to support the project, which he marketed as “coordinated with the Trump campaign,” and told others that he was in communication with Russian hackers who had access to emails he believed were Mrs. Clinton’s. But Mr. Mueller “did not establish” that the operative had actually made contact with any real Russian hackers. And while the staffer obtained emails, an effort funded by a businessman close to the campaign found that they were not really Mrs. Clinton’s either. “Collusion” has no legal definition. But if the term means working behind the scenes with Russian actors to obtain hacked information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, then this section of the report describes just that — collusion that took place at Mr. Trump’s request. It just wasn’t successful. (Volume I, pp. 130-131, 140) Throughout his time as the Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort stayed in touch with a Russian man named Konstantin Kilimnik, whom, according to the Mueller report, “the F.B.I. assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence.” Mr. Gates, Mr. Manafort’s deputy, believed Mr. Kilimnik to be a “spy.” — a view, the report says, that he shared with Mr. Manafort. While managing the campaign, Mr. Manafort told Mr. Gates to share “internal polling data” private to the campaign with Mr. Kilimnik, so he could share it with Ukrainian oligarchs and a Russian oligarch. Mr. Gates sent Mr. Kilimnik the data regularly, deleting the WhatsApp messages after he did so. In an in-person meeting with Mr. Kilimnik, Mr. Manafort shared more information about the campaign’s election plans and polling, including information about “battleground states” that would be key to Mr. Trump’s election. Mr. Gates likewise told the special counsel that Mr. Manafort believed sharing the polling data with Mr. Kilimnik, who passed it to a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, would help resolve a financial dispute between Mr. Manafort and the Russian oligarch. The report also states that Mr. Manafort hoped his campaign work would help him recover money he was owed by the other oligarchs. Yet Mr. Mueller “could not reliably determine Manafort’s purpose” in sharing the data with Mr. Kilimnik. This remains one of the more troubling loose ends in the report. (Volume II, pp. 90-93) A month after Mr. Mueller’s appointment, President Trump’s ordered his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski — who was not a government employee — to convey a message to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, telling him to constrain the scope of the Mueller investigation. Mr. Sessions, Mr. Trump said, was to deliver a speech restricting the investigation to only future election interference. Mr. Lewandowski never delivered the message. Simply firing Mr. Mueller would have been within the president’s power. Asking a private citizen to deliver that message, however, moves this outside the realm of the president’s management of the executive branch and toward clearer-cut obstruction of justice. Attorney General Bill Barr’s view that the president did not obstruct justice is informed by his argument that presidential conduct authorized by the Constitution cannot constitute obstruction. But this does not address conduct, like the order to Mr. Lewandowski, that took place outside the scope of the Constitution. “Substantial evidence,” Mr. Mueller writes, “indicates that the president’s effort to have Sessions limit the scope of the special counsel’s investigation to future election interference was intended to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the president’s and his campaign’s conduct.” The longer one spends with the report, the more disturbing a document it is, despite the initial fuzziness of some of Mr. Mueller’s conclusions. The instances here make up only about 12 pages out of a report that spans hundreds. Mr. Mueller makes clear that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election with the goal of supporting Mr. Trump; that the Trump campaign sought to benefit from that interference; and that the president worked to put to an end to the office investigating the interference effort. Questions remain, but the most important question is whether this conduct should be acceptable. Quinta Jurecic (@qjurecic) is the managing editor of Lawfare.

2019,4 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies. CAMERA OBTRUSA: THE ACTION DOCUMENTARIES OF KAZUO HARA at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 14). MoMA cites Errol Morris and Michael Moore as fans of this Japanese documentarian; “The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On” (on Monday), which follows a potentially mad World War II veteran as he seeks to extract information about the deaths of army cohorts in 1945, made Morris’s nonfiction-cinema top 10. It’s hard to top the voyeuristic what-am-I-watching? factor of Hara’s “Extreme Private Eros: Love Song 1974,” which the director and his wife, Sachiko Kobayashi, both of whom are featured in the movie, will introduce on Friday. (It also screens on Monday.) The film is difficult to classify, but it is largely a portrait of Miyuki Takeda, Hara’s ex-wife, as she raises their son and has fraught relationships with a Japanese woman and a male American soldier. She also insults the residents of Okinawa with her pamphleteering and — in the film’s pièce de résistance — gives birth on camera without assistance. 212-708-9400, moma.org HOME MOVIES: FILMMAKERS DOCUMENT THEIR FAMILIES at Anthology Film Archives (June 6-20). Although the title of this retrospective may conjure images of an uncle fumbling with a camcorder, the home movies here are far from ordinary. Chantal Akerman’s “No Home Movie” (on Saturday and June 16) is at once a portrait of her mother, a Holocaust survivor, and a meditation on exile — the experience, as critics noted upon the film’s release, of having no home. And although Andy Warhol shot “Mrs. Warhol” (on Friday and June 16) in the basement apartment where his mother lived, the movie “casts” her as a former bathing beauty who worked for Mack Sennett, the producer regarded as the king of silent-screen comedy. Other off-kilter family portraits in this series come from, among others, Jean Eustache (whose rarely screened “Numéro Zéro,” about his grandmother, shows on June 13), Stan Brakhage and Joyce Chopra. 212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] NATURAL TRANSGRESSIONS: THE FILMS OF CARLOS REYGADAS at the Museum of the Moving Image (June 8-13). After attracting attention for the heavy-handed allegory and explicit sexuality of “Japón” and “Battle in Heaven” (both showing on Saturday), this Mexican provocateur moved into an unexpectedly serene direction with “Silent Light” (on Sunday), a contemplative tale of extramarital longing in a Mennonite community, and the enigmatically structured, synopsis-resistant “Post Tenebras Lux” (also on Sunday) — all the while never abandoning his magnificent eye for landscapes or offhand surreality. The museum’s retrospective is designed as a lead-in to his latest movie, “Our Time” (on June 13), which stars Reygadas and his wife, the film editor Natalia López, as a couple whose open marriage comes under strain. 718-784-0077, movingimage.us OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA at Film at Lincoln Center (through June 12). Anyone familiar with the grandiosity and broad comic stylings of Paolo Sorrentino (“The Great Beauty,” “The Young Pope”) knows that “Loro” (on Saturday and Tuesday), his satirical take on the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi (played by Toni Servillo), won’t be anything like a sober-minded exposé. That’s just one of the notable titles in this week of movies from Italy. In “The Disappearance of My Mother” (on Monday), Beniamino Barrese creates a layered portrait of his mother, Benedetta Barzini, a former Italian supermodel. “A feminist and Marxist who now also teaches, Barzini is a severe, unsparing critic of the commodification and exploitation of the female body by men, which greatly complicates her son’s insistent, at times intrusive gaze,” Manohla Dargis wrote after the film played at Sundance. The series also pays tribute to Bernardo Bertolucci with a screening of his debut feature, “La Commare Secca,” also known as “The Grim Reaper,” on Tuesday. 212-875-5601, filmlinc.org",The New York Times
2019,4 Officer Suicides in 3 Weeks: N.Y.P.D. Struggles to Dispel Mental Health Stigma,"A cluster of police suicides has prompted leaders to plead with troubled officers to seek help. But resistance is strong. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] First, there was the deputy chief facing mandatory retirement as his 63rd birthday approached. The next day, it was a veteran homicide detective who had talked dozens of people out of killing themselves. A week later, it was a young patrolman handling domestic violence cases and going through a divorce. Then on Wednesday, a veteran officer was found dead at his home on Long Island. All four officers took their own lives this month with their service pistols, highlighting an uncomfortable reality: More police officers commit suicide every year in New York City than are killed in the line of duty, and the department’s efforts to persuade despondent officers to seek counseling have had only limited success. Since 2014, an average of five New York City police officers have taken their own lives each year, according to the Police Department. Six have died by suicide in the last six months alone. Researchers say police officers are at a higher risk of suicide than people in other jobs, a consequence of the intense stress of their work, peer pressure to keep their emotions hidden, and easy access to firearms. The recent cluster of deaths prompted Commissioner James P. O’Neill to declare a mental-health crisis and to direct officers to seek help. “There is no shame in seeking assistance from the many resources available both inside and outside the department,” Mr. O’Neill said in a message to his 36,000 officers on June 14. “Accepting help is never a sign of weakness — in fact, it’s a sign of great strength.” City police officers have a range of options to get confidential help, from department chaplains and peer-support groups to phone and text message hotlines. But for many officers, emotional vulnerability is incompatible with their desire to be seen as heroes, according to researchers who study police stress. Many officers who need counseling swallow their feelings, fearing that their careers or their rapport with other officers will suffer if they seek counseling. “Officers are very hesitant to ask for help,” said John Violanti, an epidemiologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo who is a former New York State trooper. “The culture sort of mandates that you don’t have problems, that you’re a RoboCop and you’re not affected by emotion. And we all know that’s not possible if you’re human.” No matter what assurances the Police Department — the “job” in police parlance — makes in overtures to troubled officers, many of them believe that a stigma remains, and that seeking psychological help will lead to a swift change in one’s position. “The job will tell you they’re here to look out for you, but the No. 1 rule is the job is there to protect the job,” William P. Ryan, a retired detective, said. “You go in there and say you’re depressed or whatever, they modify you. They take your guns.” Mr. Violanti said the bottled-up stress of life and police work, combined with constant access to guns, makes it easy for officers to act on a suicidal impulse. Officers have as much as a 54 percent higher risk of suicide than other workers, he said, based on mortality data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Support programs have proven to avert suicides by letting officers know they have other options, researchers said. “Most people who are suicidal don’t want to die, but they might not see any alternatives,” said Lieutenant Richard I. Mack, who volunteers with Police Organization Providing Peer Assistance, a nonprofit anti-suicide program created in 1996 after 26 officers killed themselves in a two-year span. Still, getting depressed officers to ask for help remains the biggest challenge for commanders. Edwin C. Roessler Jr., the police chief in Fairfax County, Va., said he has tried leading by example, telling officers in training about his decision to see a therapist in 2010. Initially the response was “just blank faces,” Chief Roessler said, but later officers would often contact him and say things like, “‘Hey chief, it’s about time we did something about this.’” Three of the recent suicides — Deputy Chief Steven J. Silks, 62, of Queens; Detective Joseph G. Calabrese, 57, of Brooklyn; and Officer Michael Caddy, 29, of Staten Island — were dealing with the sort of problems that experts say contribute to suicide. The fourth officer, who had not been identified on Thursday morning, appeared to have served 24 years in the New York Police Department, officials said. He appeared to have shot himself in his home in Hicksville, N.Y. The Police Department said it would conduct “psychological autopsies” to examine the officers’ lives for clues about what led them to their decisions. Last August, Mr. O’Neill appointed a mental health and wellness coordinator to promote healthy habits that police work can interfere with, like exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and socializing with family and friends. “This isn’t soft, touchy-feely stuff either,” the coordinator, Detective Jeff Thompson, said. “Because what happens if you don’t? You go home and you start isolating yourself, and then you start thinking that the world is a terrible place and there’s nothing good.” Still, the hard-shell attitudes of many officers are difficult to change. Karen Solomon, the founder of Blue H.E.L.P., a nonprofit that collects data on police suicides, said she received a disturbing call from a city police officer just days after Mr. O’Neill’s message. “He said, ‘I was talking to a bunch of guys about this, and they were making fun of the officers and calling them weak and saying that we’re better off without them,’” Ms. Solomon said. One hurdle to addressing police suicide is a lack of information. Comprehensive data is nonexistent. Police departments are not required to report suicides to a national body, and some jurisdictions record them as natural deaths to protect police families from embarrassment or prevent the families from losing death benefits. “We need to know more about the extent and nature of the problem and what is driving this,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, an organization that works to improve the professionalism of policing. “In 2019, we do not know the answer to that.” Still, the national data that is available indicates that more law enforcement officers have died by suicide in the last three and a half years than have been killed carrying out their duties. Blue H.E.L.P has estimated that at least 478 officers have committed suicide since January 2016, while the F.B.I. has reported that at least 368 officers were killed during a crime or an on-the-job accident during that period. So far this year, at least 91 officers committed suicide and at least 47 died in the line of duty. A number of law enforcement leaders see a need to dismantle the taboo against seeking treatment for mental health that they believe is pushing officers in their ranks toward self-inflicted deaths. At a suicide symposium in April at Police Headquarters in New York City, more than 300 police chiefs, clinicians, consultants and researchers met to discuss what they have quietly struggled with for decades. Suicides raise difficult questions for police leaders, like how to classify them in the hierarchy of police deaths, whether to attend the funerals, and when and how to take a troubled officer’s gun. Some police commanders, like Deputy Chief Joseph J. Reznick in New York, said they slept better after confiscating an officer’s gun. But psychologists warned that forcing officers to give up their weapons — symbols of the job that forms their identity — can drive them further into despair. In addition, suicidal officers can find other methods and weapons, they said. Detective Thompson, the Police Department’s mental health coordinator, said an officer’s gun is taken away in New York only as part of a thoughtful process aimed at saving a life. It is a temporary measure, he said, and does not spell the end of their careers. “We don’t just take the person’s gun away and then just kick them out into the abyss,” he said. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources. Ali Watkins and Michael Wilson contributed reporting. An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the New York Police Department's mental health and wellness coordinator. He is Detective Jeff Thompson, not Thomas. It also misstated the number of suicides among the department's officers this year. There have been six suicides, not five.",The New York Times
2019,4 Questions Hovering Over the Raytheon-United Technologies Deal to Create a Defense Giant,"The two companies say joining forces will be good for America. But President Trump and antitrust experts worry that the deal could reduce competition. Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon’s chief executive, sounded like he was selling his company’s proposed merger with United Technologies not just as good for shareholders but as a patriotic endeavor. “This is over all a great play for the United States of America, making us a better country, a much stronger country and a country that’s built on noble jobs,” Mr. Kennedy said on CNBC on Monday. “It’s a win-win for all.” The grandiose sales pitch should not come as a surprise. The deal coincides with pointed questions from many lawmakers and regulators about the economic benefits and costs of large mergers. President Trump, who has opposed some big corporate deals, said he was a “little concerned” that the Raytheon-United Technologies merger could raise the cost of military hardware. The combined company, to be called Raytheon Technologies, would be a defense and aerospace colossus with annual sales of nearly $75 billion, more than either Lockheed Martin or Airbus posted last year. It would combine Raytheon’s missile and radar systems with United Technologies’ jet engines, which are used in commercial and military aircraft, including the F-35 fighter. Here are some big questions and issues the companies must contend with as they seek the approval of government officials and shareholders. Raytheon and United Technologies said the merger would help them slash costs and pass $500 million in savings on to buyers of their products, chiefly the Defense Department. The companies said the combined firm might be able to save more than $350 million a year just by reducing what they spent on parts and raw materials. But Gregory Sanders, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said technological advances in the defense sector often happened at smaller suppliers to bigger companies. “That is one of the areas where you worry about innovation,” he said. The companies’ executives contend that the combined entity would have the scale and financial resources to increase spending on research and development. But it is not clear that Raytheon Technologies would invest more money in research than the combined total of the two individual companies, something Mr. Kennedy appeared to acknowledge in a call with analysts on Monday. “It depends on what the programs are that we invest in,” he said in response to a question about spending levels. Executives said the combined company would return as much as $20 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks in the three years after the merger was completed. Investors appear to have doubts about the deal, however. Stock in United Technologies, whose shareholders would own about 57 percent of the combined company, has dropped 7 percent since the merger was announced. Raytheon’s shares are down 4.5 percent. William A. Ackman, the chief executive of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund, questioned the merits of the merger in an email to the chief executive of United Technologies, Gregory J. Hayes. Mr. Ackman wrote that United Technologies lacked “the expertise to provide effective oversight of Raytheon’s businesses and, in attempting to do so, at a minimum, will lose focus,” according to a person who saw the email. Before the announcement, United Technologies was splitting itself into three companies: an aerospace division, which would merge with Raytheon; Otis, which makes elevators and escalators; and Carrier, which produces heating and cooling equipment. Raytheon and United Technologies may be positioning themselves for a slowdown or reversal in a current surge in spending by the American military and commercial airlines. Three times in their announcement, the companies said the merger would help the new firm operate through “the business cycle,” meaning in good times and bad. Some economists believe that a big increase in mergers and acquisitions can suggest that an expansion may be ending. Companies may be more likely to seek partners when they are struggling to increase profits and sales. So far this year, companies have announced mergers and acquisitions totaling $1 trillion, up 14 percent from the same period last year, according to data from Dealogic. “What consolidation does, which is what M&A is all about, is remove a source of competition, and it is a wonderful way of improving your pricing power position,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, an investment firm based in Toronto. The companies contend that because they are not currently in the same businesses, the merger will not increase the combined firm’s market position in, say, jet engines or missiles. Just 1 percent of the companies’ sales overlap, Mr. Hayes said Monday on CNBC. “There is nothing anticompetitive about bringing these companies together,” he said. But antitrust experts say Mr. Trump is right to be worried. Deals involving businesses that are closely related to each other can strengthen the combined company’s market power. Raytheon and United Technologies have suggested that the deal would create “highly complementary technology offerings,” something that critics of big mergers consider to be a red flag. “They could use the enhanced footprint and enhanced market power to potentially make it harder for their rivals to compete,” said Diana L. Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a Washington group that advocates stronger antitrust enforcement. “I would imagine that Rolls-Royce, a rival, would be somewhat agitated.” United Technologies and Raytheon will most likely need to convince the Pentagon that a merger will not reduce incentives to provide the most advanced and inexpensive technologies. The Defense Department has blocked some previous mergers — including Lockheed Martin’s proposed purchase of Northrop Grumman in the late 1990s — after concluding that the deals threatened competition. The government’s foremost concern is that there is sufficient innovation in the defense sector to design and produce new weapons systems, said William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University Law School and a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. “Any shrinking in the number of these enterprises ought to be a matter of concern for the defense agencies and for government antitrust agencies,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,4 Questions You Should Ask Before Buying a House With a Friend,"Friends and unmarried couples make up a growing segment of the housing market. If that’s you, here’s what you need to know before buying. If you’re unmarried and interested in owning a house, the idea of buying one with a romantic partner or a friend has probably crossed your mind. In the past decade, the median price of an American home rose by 27.5 percent, and prices are predicted to continue rising at twice the rate of inflation and wage growth. For most first-time home buyers, affording a down payment or a mortgage on their own is not financially feasible, which might be why unmarried duos are becoming a larger portion of home buyers. According to data from the National Association of Realtors, 15 percent of millennial home buyers are buying in unmarried partnerships, and 8 percent of all home buyers are unmarried partners. Whether you’ve already decided to buy a house with someone else or are just exploring the idea of co-ownership, here are a few conversations you’ll want to make sure you have before signing those purchase papers. This is probably the first and most important conversation you should have when you’re negotiating co-ownership. While most people assume that the financial burden is always divided evenly in co-ownership arrangements, that isn’t true in every case. In some scenarios, one person contributes the entire down payment, or loans the other person their half of the down payment. Additionally, co-owners with significantly different incomes might split the costs based on their income ratio. Christina Cranston and a friend, both flight attendants for a major airline, worked and traveled together for years before moving in together. After being roommates for a year, they decided to buy a house. “I would describe our relationship as sisters,” Ms. Cranston said. Their decision was a primarily financial one — together they could buy a nicer house than either could afford on her own — but it was also emotional. They both appreciated the benefits of co-ownership: There was someone with whom to share decisions and financial risk. However, their finances weren’t as straightforward. Ms. Cranston was able to sell a condominium and use the proceeds as the down payment. They ultimately decided that Ms. Cranston would initially be the sole owner of the property, with the expectation that they would adjust the financial terms in the future. Regardless of the financial details, the two women treat the home as an equal co-ownership arrangement and jointly make all the decisions about repairs, improvements and household rules. As tempting as it might be to focus on buying a house, make sure to talk about what it will be like to actually live in the house together. Frederick Hertz is a lawyer and mediator in the San Francisco Bay Area who specializes in creating housing agreements to help nonromantic co-owners and unmarried couples navigate the co-ownership process. He said that as home prices in the Bay Area have skyrocketed, nontraditional living arrangements have become more common. In his initial meeting with hopeful home buyers, Mr. Hertz begins with this warning: “If you can’t make it through a two-hour meeting with me discussing the issues, then you shouldn’t be buying a house together.” The idea isn’t to discourage them, it’s to initiate them into their new role as co-owners, a role that will most likely involve long discussions, complex negotiations and emotionally challenging conversations. The kind of questions that Mr. Hertz asks range from the morbid (What happens if one of you dies?) and the aesthetic (How will you make decisions about paint colors and other decorative improvements?) to the familial (How long is a houseguest allowed to stay?). Some topics to cover are space allocation (Does someone get to have a home office? Does one person get exclusive use of the garage?), landscaping and yardwork (Is one person in charge of the labor and the other person in charge of the cost? Who gets to decide how much to spend on that birdbath?), upgrades and repairs (If somebody tiles the bathroom, do they get reimbursed for their labor? What happens if the furnace breaks and only one person can afford the repair bill?) and rules for houseguests. This is especially important if you’re considering buying a house with a friend who is not a romantic partner. When will a boyfriend or girlfriend stop being an overnight guest and start being treated as a roommate? Are aging family members welcome to live with you? What about children? These conversations might seem unnecessarily granular but the result is that you and your prospective co-owner will become comfortable discussing difficult topics. “Very few people are self-aware enough to know how they’ll behave as co-owners.” Mr. Hertz said. “Sometimes the best outcome is for both parties to realize they are not a good match as co-owners.” Allegra Brantly, 32, an entrepreneur from Austin, Tex., had been dating her boyfriend, Jake, 28, a data scientist, for over a year when they started talking about buying a house together. They had watched housing prices in Austin creep higher as housing prices hit record highs in 2017 and again in 2018. “We definitely weren’t ready to talk marriage or forever, but we also realized that by the time we were ready to buy a home together, we wouldn’t be able to afford it.” Ms. Brantly said. “The risk of splitting up seemed less than the risk of being out-priced.” Before they agreed to buy a house together, the couple discussed potential outcomes at length, like what would happen if one of them lost their job and couldn’t contribute to the mortgage payments, or if they broke up. They eventually decided that if their relationship ended, they would both move out and keep the property as an investment, with a property manager doing the day-to-day management. “Obviously we hope to stay together happily for years, but at the end of the day, our house is an investment and a financial decision, and so no matter what happens with our relationship, we want to preserve our equity.” Tiffany Elkins, a Portland, Ore. lawyer who specializes in real estate litigation, said that the conversation about the relationship ending needs to go one step further: what happens if one of the co-owners dies? Whether the other co-owner inherits the deceased owner’s portion of the property automatically by law depends entirely on what the deed says and that decision generally needs to be made at the time of purchase, or otherwise in a will or written agreement. Ms. Elkins made the point that unmarried buyers often assume that whatever they put in their co-ownership agreement is legally valid, without actually checking the laws in their state. Ms. Elkins gave the example of a couple for whom she recently drafted an agreement. In this scenario, one woman paid for the house and the other woman was going to pay her back. Ms. Elkins warned that even though their co-ownership agreement specified that if they broke up, the funds should be distributed based what they each contributed to the property, the court in Oregon might see it differently. “If they start co-mingling funds and sharing assets, then the court can regard them as being in a common law domestic partnership, and can disregard the co-ownership agreement,” she said. At that point, any equity in the property potentially could be treated as a shared asset and be divided evenly, regardless of who paid for it. Co-ownership agreements range in levels of formality. Some co-owners prefer an informal agreement, such as a verbal agreement or a handwritten agreement that they both sign. Others prefer to work with a mediator like Mr. Hertz. The most formal — and expensive — option would require each owner to hire a lawyer and go through a negotiation process much like a prenuptial agreement. Ms. Brantly and her boyfriend ended up downloading an online template and adjusting it to meet the details of their agreement. Ms. Elkins said that the money saved by creating a co-ownership agreement yourself is often not worth the money spent if something goes wrong between you and your co-owner. “If you don’t do it right and you have to clean it up later, you’re spending ten times the amount of money.” Mr. Hertz stressed the importance of making sure the agreement is legally binding. “The difference is that the rules are dramatically different if you’re married or unmarried,” he said. “Whether you’re married or unmarried, you can reach an agreement with the same rules. But if you fail to have a legally binding agreement, the law will impose a very different set of rules.”",The New York Times
2019,4 Takeaways From the Trump-Kim Meeting at the DMZ,"A high-stakes encounter at the Demilitarized Zone turned chaotic at times, with the new White House press secretary emerging bruised, reporters said. When President Trump sent a Twitter invitation on Friday to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to meet at the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating the Koreas — “just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!” — both men had much to gain, and more to lose. If Mr. Kim did not attend, even though his side had seemed intrigued, it would have embarrassed Mr. Trump and opened him up to more criticism for his unpredictable diplomacy. It would also have compounded the dramatic failure of their summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, which Mr. Trump abruptly called off in February. But the North’s leader showed up at the appointed time. Here are four takeaways from the historic encounter. The scene appeared to be chaotic at times, with video footage showing journalists and camera people scurrying around the two leaders, jockeying with security officials and elbowing one another to position themselves into the perfect spot to record the encounter. And the North Korean security forces left bruises on the American side. Stephanie Grisham, the newly minted White House press secretary, had a trial by fire after she tried to facilitate the American television crew’s entry into a building called Freedom House and emerged roughed up by North Korean officers, according to journalists and footage from the scene. She can be heard saying, “No,” “Stop” and “Need help here” as she is pushed and jostled by men in suits. The CNN reporter Jim Acosta said on Twitter that the encounter was described as “an all out brawl.” Earlier, he said during a broadcast that he had experienced the same treatment when he was in Singapore for Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Kim’s first summit, in 2018. The unpredictable nature of the meeting at the DMZ and its security logistics could not be overstated, as at times Mr. Kim’s bodyguards, grim-looking behind sunglasses, appeared to be straining to fully protect the North’s leader. They seemed hemmed in by Western reporters, camera people and handlers from the United States, North Korea and South Korea. In addition, shouts of “Guys! Guys! Come on!” could be heard as photographers yelled for two North Korean cameramen to get out of the shot. The two were relentless in their mission to record their leader’s meeting with Mr. Trump — even if it meant blocking the other journalists. The unexpected invitation on Friday that took Mr. Trump’s diplomatic corps by surprise while the president was attending the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, was a Hail Mary appeal that experts acknowledged paid off in symbolism — if not in immediate concrete gains. It morphed from a tweet, to a handshake, to a historic 20 steps by an American leader into officially hostile territory: At 3:46 p.m. local time on Sunday, Mr. Trump became the first serving American president to cross the border and set foot in North Korea. “Big moment, big moment,” said Mr. Trump, who patted Mr. Kim several times on the back. “It is good to see you again,” a beaming Mr. Kim told the president at the Demilitarized Zone through an interpreter. “I never expected to meet you in this place.” After posing for photographs in a crush of international journalists, the two men walked back to the South Korean side amid a whir of cameras and had a bilateral meeting that lasted about an hour in Freedom House. At the end, Mr. Trump said the two men had agreed to send their negotiators back to the table to seek a long-elusive agreement on the North’s nuclear ambitions. Mr. Trump also said he would invite Mr. Kim to visit him at the White House. During the meeting on Sunday, video footage showed intimate, colorful glimpses of a border sometimes called the last Cold War frontier. Viewers caught sight of men holding a thick yellow rope, which apparently was used to corral journalists at the site. (It was not quite the velvet rope the White House Press Office put up in front of the press corps in 2017, when Sean Spicer was press secretary.) Then there were the blue huts. The 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone that has separated North and South Korea for decades is jointly overseen by the American-led United Nations Command and North Korea. The squat huts, which straddle the demarcation line, are painted powder blue in the color of the United Nations. Camera lenses offered close-up views of the barriers and markers in the “truce village” of Panmunjom — 32 miles north of Seoul and 91 miles south of Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital — where officials signed an armistice in 1953 to halt the three-year Korean War. The area is lined with mines and barbed-wire fences, though those were not as visible on Sunday. Combat-ready soldiers train deadly weapons at the other side. But on Sunday, it appeared to be overrun by journalists. As cameras homed in on the low concrete barrier that Mr. Trump crossed to enter into North Korea on Sunday, it hardly seemed daunting. But visitors have dared not cross the slab, for fear of being shot. In 2017, a North Korean soldier defected to South Korea through the heavily guarded zone separating the two countries, leading to gunfire on both sides of the border. Closed-circuit television footage showed the soldier’s dramatic dash through the Joint Security Area north of Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Nov. 13. The most notorious incident at Panmunjom happened in 1976, according to The Associated Press, when ax-wielding North Korean soldiers killed two American officers sent out to trim a tree that had been blocking the view from a checkpoint. Washington sent nuclear-capable bombers toward the DMZ in response. Animosities eased after Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong-un, expressed regret for the episode. The two leaders greeted each other like old friends on Sunday, with a beaming Mr. Kim, 35, praising Mr. Trump, 73, and with the American president offering effusive praise of the man many experts have called a brutal, mercurial dictator who has killed members of his own family. “This has a lot of significance because it means that we want to bring an end to the unpleasant past and try to create a new future, so it’s a very courageous and determined act,” Mr. Kim told reporters through an interpreter. “I don’t think this kind of surprise meeting would have happened without the excellent personal relationship between your excellency and me,” he later told Mr. Trump in Freedom House. “If he didn’t show up, the press was going to make me look very bad,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Kim, adding, “So you made us both look good, and I appreciate it.” Later, he said: “Certainly, this was a great day; this was a very legendary, very historic day.” But even as the meeting thrummed with the weight of a symbolic moment of reconciliation, Mr. Trump is eager for a resolution to the stalled nuclear talks with North Korea as he heads into a re-election year. He clearly hopes it would be defined as a signature element that could boost his campaign. But United States intelligence agencies and analysts have concluded that North Korea “is unlikely” to give up its nuclear arsenal. Mr. Kim has stoked an international crisis by launching missiles and projectiles — as recently as May — and threatening more nuclear weapons tests. “Tomorrow, North Korea will still have nuclear weapons, and the U.S. will still maintain sanctions,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. Even Mr. Trump, amid the lavish praise, injected a word of caution that anything concrete would materialize from his moment, saying: “It’ll be even more historic if something comes out of it.” Peter Baker contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,48 Hours With a Men’s Wear Designer Inspired by ’90s London,"Martine Rose prepares her spring collection in the shadow of Brexit. 17 Photos View Slide Show › It’s a late afternoon in North London, two days before Martine Rose’s spring 2020 men’s wear show, and the designer and her longtime friend and stylist Tamara Rothstein are in the courtyard outside Rose’s studio doing fittings. The hair stylist Gary Gill layers a second long burgundy wig onto a model, whose head starts to take on a conical shape; his mouth is lightly smeared with red lipstick, applied by the makeup artist Marina Belfon-Rose, “as if he’s gone out and literally just had a massive snog,” she observes. The wigs and makeup reference the progressive gender politics of iconic London club nights from the ’80s and ’90s, such as Kinky Gerlinky, a theme that Rose explores in her collection. “Is it too much?” Rose asks Rothstein, and they pause to consider the model, who is wearing a denim jacket with oversize shoulders over a red satin dragon-print shirt, paired with flared fitted trousers. “The boys look slightly sinister,” Rose explains. “I wanted an unsettling feeling, because that’s the undertone in everything happening globally. It feels like a real time of shift and it’s slightly terrifying.” The designer is wearing a key piece from her collection, a white T-shirt featuring a print of a cartoon clown encircled by stars — a reference to the European Union — with the words “Promising Britain” emblazoned above. “There are very clear political undertones in the collection,” she says. “The tongue is firmly in the cheek. I’m referring to the government.” Since Rose founded her brand in 2007, her irreverence and well-informed explorations of British subcultures, such as the city’s ’90s-era rave and reggae scenes, have made her a favorite at London Fashion Week Men’s. She doesn’t show every season, but when she does, her shows are memorable for more than just the subversive clothes — recent locations have included a community rock-climbing gym, for spring 2018, and a sleepy North London street, for spring 2019, where residents watched the parade of models, mostly local boys, from their windows. [Coming soon: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] The next day, Rose and her team are back in the studio after a late night finalizing the remaining looks, which range from oversize suiting to a fringe jacket paired with brocade chinoiserie trousers. She’s tired and smoking rolled cigarettes but pauses to greet the North London M.C. Bushkin, who is getting fitted for the show — in resin-treated jeans and a dark blazer with exaggerated shoulders — along with a host of street-cast models. “It’s not just clothes,” Rose says. “I like what people bring to clothes. I’m interested in the personalities.” The daughter of a Jamaican father and English mother, Rose grew up as the youngest in a sprawling South London family. Her early encounters with rave culture still influence her today. “I would go to church with my nan, and then after we would go to Clapham Common,” she says, referring to the large South London park where ravers would congregate and dance on Sunday mornings before going home. “I was 9 years old and used to dance all of Sunday with them, and it was so inclusive. That resonated with me on a very profound level.” Sunday’s show takes place on the rooftop of an office building in the middle of the City, London’s financial district. “The location was very important so that we could see the London skyline,” Rose explains. “As I was designing the collection, corporations were leaving London because of Brexit.” That afternoon, Rose finalizes the order of the looks with her team, working in an empty office space that had until recently housed one of Amazon’s London outposts. A palpable nervous energy builds after the rehearsal, as models go through the final stages of hair and makeup. As the show begins, guests are packed onto simple white benches and the rain holds back. The models walk out to a mash-up of reggae and ’80s punk rock evocative of London’s pirate radio stations, and the atmosphere is charged. After the show, Rose joins a big group of friends and family, including her 4-year-old daughter, Valentine, and 18-month-old son, Reuben, on the rooftop before heading out for a celebratory pint at the pub around the corner, where the mood is ebullient. Despite the critique of Britain’s government and the references to ominous global undercurrents that are woven through her collection, Rose wants to finish the day on a positive note. “I believe in humans and our relationship together, despite all the terrifying things that govern us,” she says, laughing. “I made badges saying ‘Magic Things Ahead,’ so it’s not all doom and gloom!”",The New York Times
2019,5 Alternatives to Corporate Pride Merch,"Why buy mass-market rainbows when you could get something unique? Each year, when the month of June rolls around, big brands emerge awash in rainbow colors. There are rainbow-soled Pride sneakers from Puma and reusable rainbow cups courtesy of the world’s largest coffee corporation. Urban Outfitters is selling a line of Pride merchandise, and Snapchat created a special filter for the month. This week, Taylor Swift released a music video filled with Pride flags and a cast of gay, trans and nonbinary celebrities. On Thursday, it had more than 40 million views on YouTube. Sometimes these shows of corporate solidarity go awry. A few Pride campaigns have been called out for manufacturing apparel in countries where being gay is illegal or where queer people are commonly persecuted. Others are led by companies that have been criticized for their labor practices. The good news is there are plenty of queer independent artists whose small-batch work can be purchased any month of the year. Here are five of them. Adrienne Muse began drawing professionally in 2012, when a co-worker, impressed by the art in her office, said he’d pay for a portrait of his daughter. In her personal work, she focuses on queer representation, depicting women in their moments of intimacy and leisure. “There is not that much art featuring women of color and even less with queer women of color, and I really want to change that,” Mrs. Muse, 38, said. She is perhaps best known for her celebrity portraiture; her famous subjects have included Prince, Whitney Houston, Lauryn Hill and Nipsey Hussle, some of whose images she also prints on T-shirts ($45). “I know some artists think that’s commercial, but I understand that a lot of people aren’t financially able to collect original artwork, especially people of color in my community,” she said. “I wanted to give them another way to show their support. I consider anyone who purchases a print or a T-shirt from me a collector.” Hana Shafi, a Toronto-based illustrator and writer, is known for her Instagram affirmations on race and gender: “feminism is freedom from gender violence,” “We deserve more than just survival/ we deserve to thrive,” “even if you can’t tell your story/ I hear you/ I believe you.” These statements appear on printed illustrations and buttons, so her fans who contribute to her Patreon page can incorporate the messages into private and public spaces. “As a queer Muslim woman my identity is inherently politicized, so my art is always going to reflect that,” she said. Ms. Shafi, 25, sees her art as a means of combating various forms of oppression. “I know that my story is not the only one, so I want to show different marginalized experiences through my work,” she said. “I want to show black trans experiences, Muslim experiences, and have my followers feel compelled to support people with those identities.” Ab Gibson and Al Rose’s soy wax candles began from a shared hobby. “Candle making was something we loved doing,” Ms. Gibson, 25, said. “So we decided, instead of buying products to make them, why not do it ourselves?” The candles are infused with herbs like rosemary, sage and mint, grown by the couple in their Washington Heights home. “Candles are marketed as this luxury item and we wanted to make them available to our friends, family and community,” said Ms. Rose, 23. The candles cost $10 each, and 10 percent of the duo’s monthly proceeds go to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, a grass-roots organization that focuses on supporting transgender and gender nonconforming youth of color. “We realize that as queer people we also carry a lot of privilege,” Ms. Gibson said. “We are white, we have jobs, and so we wanted to put our money where our mouth is.” Uzo Ejikeme, 33, and Stoney Michelli, 37, started the clothing company Stuzo to proudly proclaim that queerness was a valid identity. “In college, an ex-boyfriend of mine asked me if I was still gay,” said Mrs. Michelli. “I remember thinking what type of question is that? After, I knew I wanted to create something which showed that being queer was not a phase. It’s who we are and that’s how the first logo was created.” Based in L.A., Mrs. Ejikeme and Mrs. Michelli are intentional about representing the purpose of the brand, down to the models hired. “This isn’t just about finding a pretty face and putting clothes on them,” said Mrs. Ejikeme. “They have to be unapologetic about who they are, and they have to invoke our mission statement, which is to live boldly and to live unapologetically.” Lex Non Scripta and Voula O created Wild Fancy Design in 2010. “We were interested in making jewelry that supports self-expression and queer self-determination,” Voula O, 40, said. Based in Western Massachusetts, the artists design fun, quirky pieces that play on the malleability of gender or highlight the importance of personal pronouns. “Extraction of metals is intensive on our planet and we are very mindful of that,” said Lex Non Scripta. The jewelry is made with vintage deadstock materials sourced from warehouses across the country. “It’s not efficient, but it’s worth it,” said Voula O.",The New York Times
2019,5 Books That Shed Light on D-Day,"Newsbook It’s been 75 years since the Allied forces landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, to fight the Nazi occupation in Europe. These books take a kaleidoscopic view of that momentous day. THE LONGEST DAY: The Classic Epic of D-Day, June 6, 1944 by Cornelius Ryan First published in 1959, this book is a classic of World War II history. Ryan draws on hundreds of interviews and research conducted in five countries for this military history that recreates the hours before and after the invasion of Normandy by more than 200,000 Allied soldiers. “It is a superb, gripping story,” our reviewer wrote, “more exciting than any novel on this theme could possibly be.” SOLDIER, SAILOR, FROGMAN, SPY, AIRMAN, GANGSTER, KILL OR DIE: How the Allies Won on D-Day by Giles Milton Milton’s book, released earlier this year, takes a human approach to the story of D-Day, based on interviews with survivors, both on the Allied and the Axis side. FORGOTTEN: THE UNTOLD STORY OF D-DAY’S BLACK HEROES, AT HOME AND AT WAR by Linda Hervieux This book, published in 2015, tells the story of the only African-American combat unit that landed in Normandy and emphasizes the discrimination these black soldiers faced at home. D-DAY GIRLS: THE SPIES WHO ARMED THE RESISTANCE, SABOTAGED THE NAZIS AND HELPED WIN WORLD WAR II by Sarah Rose In this 2019 book, Rose drew from recently declassified files, diaries and oral histories to tell the story of three women — Andrée Borrel, Odette Sansom and Lise de Baissac — who joined the war as spies for the Allies. It highlights the crucial role they played in gathering intelligence and carrying out operations. THE FIRST WAVE: THE D-DAY WARRIORS WHO LED THE WAY TO VICTORY IN WORLD WAR II by Alex Kershaw Kershaw, in this book published in May, focuses on the soldiers at the front line of the Normandy invasion, who saw the highest number of casualties among their forces.",The New York Times
2019,5 Cheap(ish) Things for a Dip in the Pool,"Pool season is finally here. The weather is finally warming and that means pool season is upon us. As a warning to all who plan to invite me over this summer, I don’t pack light. At a minimum, I’ll bring my sunglasses, my favorite beach towel, my biggest wide-brimmed hat and a pair of flip-flops. My list of necessities can grow longer, especially if I have little ones in tow. Not only must I have the wherewithal to pack their floaties and favorite snacks, but I have to make sure the collective needs of the adults are also met. That means accounting for things we’ll require before we jump in the water, while we’re swimming and when we dry off and head home. It’s a lot of stuff! Whether you’re heading to a private or public pool, safety and comfort are paramount. Stock up on the essentials to keep hydrated, protect everyone’s skin from the sun and (hopefully) have some fun. With that in mind, in collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) items to take when you go for a dip at the pool. [Want even more great advice? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.] Unless you want to come back from your pool jaunt looking like a broiled tomato, you must regularly apply sunscreen. Wirecutter recommends Coppertone’s Ultra Guard Sunscreen Lotion SPF 70, a smooth, water-resistant lotion that is effective for up to 80 minutes. It’s thin, so it’s easy to apply, and it’s loaded with vitamin E and other moisturizers. Slather it on liberally and often, especially after drying off with a towel. Pro tip: Bring a growler with you to the pool. Not only will it keep beverages cold or fizzy — even in direct sunlight — but it’ll help keep your whole crew hydrated. Wirecutter recommends Miir’s 64oz Growler. This handsome, leak-proof growler boasts a buckled flip-top lid that seals securely and keeps liquids cold for up to 24 hours. The handle also allows for easy pouring, and the hardshell powder coat makes it sweat-resistant. Don’t forget to bring cups! Pool noodles are fabulous because they’re so versatile. They give support while you’re relaxing in the water, they’re fun to splash around with and they even aid in light exercise. However, not all pool noodles are created equal. Wirecutter recommends the Robelle Big Boss pool noodles for teens and adults. These soft, buoyant and eco-friendly pool toys are 58 inches long and are sold in a pack of six. If you have kiddos, the 52-inch-long Fix Find Wacky Noodles might be a better fit for them. A durable, absorbent, pool-appropriate towel should strike the right balance of being fluffy yet quick to dry and easy to pack. Wirecutter recommends L.L.Bean’s Seaside Beach Towel. It comes in bright, attractive colors, dries fast without fading and it’s made of water-wicking cotton. Feeling fancy? The towels can be monogrammed with up to 10 characters. [Read more: Check out Wirecutter’s summer gear guide.] When you’re ready to go home (or head back to your hotel room), it helps to have something sturdy and breathable that can stash wet towels and bathing suits. The Saltwater Canvas Whale Bag is Wirecutter’s pick. Made of weatherproof mesh, it can stow up to six towels, snacks, drinks, goggles, toys — you name it. It’s equipped with nine pockets to slide sunscreen, lotions, phones and everything else into. It’ll keep your things neat, and it’s a cinch to clean. As a bonus, it folds flat for easy storage.

Maybe That’s Not a Problem? A whimsical, effective solution to a challenging social condition. Let Go of Your Grudges. They’re Doing You No Good. What does holding on to grudges really get us? This week I’ve invited the writer Leah Fessler to show us the value of handshakes in negotiations. Avoiding a handshake is very awkward. Firm handshakes feel like a weird brag. Limp shakes feel dainty. “Huggers” can dissolve this weirdness, but sometimes feel creepy. Still, handshakes are in our best interest, according to a recent study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Shaking hands demonstrates good faith. Consider the gesture’s origin: If you grip and shake someone’s hand, you’re not holding a weapon, or hiding a dagger up your sleeve. But beyond surface-level camaraderie, the study examines whether handshaking actually promotes cooperation when parties’ incentives are aligned or opposed. Surprisingly, it does, regardless of whether participants know one another, are the same gender, shake firmly or softly, or shake spontaneously or per instruction, researchers found. Participants who shake hands at the onset of negotiating a hypothetical job offer or car sale are significantly more likely to share information (if their incentives are aligned) or lie less (if their incentives are misaligned). This effect transpires even when cooperation isn’t beneficial. “Buyers who shook hands with the sellers were less likely to lie — even to their own detriment — which made the outcomes more equitable and allowed sellers to do better,” the researchers wrote. Strange as handshaking may feel, this subtle ritual profoundly influences our social environments, behavior and evaluation of intention. “One could imagine how engaging in these types of rituals — handshakes, but also others like hugs, smiles — may be foundational for maintaining cooperative society,” said Juliana Schroeder, a co-author of the study and a professor of the management of organizations at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.",The New York Times
2019,5 Cheap(ish) Things for the Perfect Picnic,"The person who wields the corkscrew is always the hero. My favorite kind of picnics happen under the stars, maybe at an outdoor concert or a beach. But since I live in a city, my picnics are more likely to consist of a sandwich and iced coffee on a scratchy patch of grass at a public park. Whatever. I’ll take it! There’s a real thrill to eating outside, especially if you live in a climate where it’s not a year-round thing. The light breeze, the softness of the ground underneath, the hum of people chatting nearby; it can be downright electric to eat al fresco. While anyone can scrape together a meal to eat outside, to have a truly pleasant experience, it’s wise to head off spills, stains and emergencies before you set your blanket on the ground. Sure, slicing cheese with a plastic spoon or eating a messy salad with your fingers is charming on a date when you’re young and clueless, but it loses its charm when you have friends and loved ones gathered around looking to enjoy themselves without making a mess. I’ve learned two things when it comes to picnics: You have to have the right equipment on hand, and it doesn’t cost a lot of money to be picnic-ready. In collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) items to make your next picnic a roaring success whether you’re flying solo or entertaining a crowd. [Read more: 7 Tips for a Better Picnic] Blanket Choosing a regular cotton blanket or sheet for your picnic is a rookie mistake. It might be fine at first, but if the earth is slightly damp or the beach too windy, you’ll be fighting the elements the entire meal. Wirecutter recommends using the durable Nemo Victory Blanket for outdoor eating. It’s tailor-made for picnicgoers because of a soft padded flannel top and a waterproof layer on the bottom to guard against dirt, sand and water. It fits two adults — there is also a larger size to accommodate four — and it closes easily and securely. Basket Sure, you can cobble together random utensils and cups to bring to your next picnic, but if you want to take your outing to the next level, Wirecutter recommends the stylish Picnic at Ascot Collapsible Insulated Picnic Basket With Cutlery Set. This handsome, sturdy basket comes fully stocked with four sets of melamine plates, stainless steel flatware, acrylic wine glasses and napkins. It’s also fully insulated and folds flat for easy storage. [Summer Gear Guide: Picnics] Ice block Is there anything more deflating than realizing your meticulously packed picnic basket sprang a leak thanks to some melted ice? Anyone who’s packed a few picnic baskets knows that ice blocks are the way to go to ensure that beverages and food remain cold for hours. Wirecutter recommends Rubbermaid’s Blue Ice Block, which stays frozen longer than traditional ice. These no-frills ice blocks are cost-effective and reusable. Reusable bag Whether you’re bringing extra grocery items (potato chips, a six-pack) or need somewhere to stash your trash and recyclables, a small reusable bag is key to keeping your area neat. Wirecutter recommends the Baggu bag, which is compact and has generous handles wide enough to sling over your shoulder. Made of 100 percent ripstop nylon, these bags can securely hold up to 50 pounds and come in a range of fun colors and patterns. Corkscrew Nobody wants to walk around and do the “Hey, do you have a corkscrew?” shuffle when you’re supposed to be focused on relaxing outside with friends and family. The person who wields the corkscrew is the hero of the picnic. Not only can you open bottles of wine with ease, but this versatile tool is an ace at popping bottlecaps too (beer and soda fans will rejoice). Wirecutter recommends the affordable double-hinged True Fabrications’ Truetap. Dishwasher-safe and rust proof, it’s small enough to slip into any purse or backpack. P.S.
