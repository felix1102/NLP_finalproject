2017,Opinion | Trump’s Masochism,"David Leonhardt Please stop. Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin are both now endangering the reputations they built up over many years in business. They’re doing so by telling blatant untruths about President Trump’s tax plan. My column today is a plea to them to stop, for their sake and for everyone else’s. Trump vs. Corker. Top Republicans have not been very brave on the subject of Trump. They’ve made excuses for him and frequently offered lukewarm criticism of outrageous behavior. But it’s still important not to conflate widespread cowardice with support — the sort of support that almost every previous president has enjoyed from members of his own party. Trump has enjoyed less of that support than any other first-year president. I covered this topic in more detail in a recent column, and the political scientist Matt Glassman regularly tweets about it. This past weekend brought yet another example of Republican defiance, with the war of tweets between Trump and Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican. Corker followed up with an extraordinary New York Times interview in which he harshly criticized the president. “As Corker noted, most every GOP senator shares his alarm about Trump,” The Times’s Jonathan Martin later tweeted. There are some major ways in which no American should be rooting for incompetence from the White House — like in its dealings with North Korea and Iran, for example. But it’s perfectly fine to root for incompetence on the White House’s legislative agenda, given the damage that would do to so many citizens. “What does not carry weight are arguments that Americans should still want the president to succeed,” Eliot A. Cohen, the Republican former State Department official, has written. Trump’s angering of a Republican senator like Corker — when Trump may need every Republican vote to pass a tax plan and when the Senate is conducting a serious investigation of his campaign — should cheer anyone who isn’t rooting for his success. In The Times. In a video, survivors of mass shootings and relatives of gun victims issue a powerful call for action. A Nobel Prize to cheer. The Nobel in economics awarded to Richard Thaler this morning is one for non-economists to celebrate. Thaler has spent decades pushing his field to take a more realistic view of human behavior — to acknowledge that people act irrationally much more often than economists once acknowledged. He started off as a lonely voice, along with Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, among others. These days, though, Thaler’s work is mainstream, and it’s affected government policy on retirement savings and other areas. (But it still hasn’t affected policy nearly as much as it should.) Thaler’s work is also among the most accessible in economics, as The Times’s Binyamin Appelbaum noted. If you’re up for the book-length version, you can read Thaler’s memoir, “Misbehaving,” or “Nudge,” which he co-wrote with Cass Sunstein. Quicker reads include Tyler Cowen’s blog post this morning, a 2009 interview with Thaler and a 2003 story that I wrote based on a Thaler lecture. I’ll confess to being thrilled about this prize. I met Thaler almost 20 years ago when I was a young economics reporter, and he’s become a tutor, mentor and friend. He brings an impish joy to the study of human behavior, and it comes through in his writing.

2017,Opinion | Trump’s Message to Russia About Mueller,"Patrick Chappatte Paul Manafort, who led President Donald Trump’s campaign during several months in 2016, and Rick Gates, who was also a campaign official, surrendered to federal authorities after being named in an indictment obtained by Robert Mueller III, who was appointed as special counsel in May to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.",The New York Times
2017,"Trump’s Not Alone. A Lincoln Condolence Letter Stirred Controversy, Too.","What exactly is the protocol for American presidents after members of the military are killed or wounded in action? The recent controversy over President Trump’s calls to grieving military families suggests that the White House traditionally responds in a particular way. In fact, it is difficult to define presidential custom, given that the United States has had 45 presidents serving across 228 years. Here’s what the record shows: Barack Obama visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at least 23 times during his presidency, and regularly called or met with the families of troops killed overseas. George W. Bush met frequently with the families of service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he made the practice a preoccupation of his post-presidential life. Bill Clinton visited service members at Walter Reed once, while George Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter never did so, according to archivists at their presidential libraries. Even as thousands of wounded troops were brought home from the Vietnam War, Richard M. Nixon never went to Walter Reed, and Lyndon B. Johnson went only once, although he visited hospitalized soldiers during visits to Vietnam in 1966 and 1967. Looking back even further, a letter signed by Abraham Lincoln may offer insight into the perils of interpreting private presidential consolations in a broader public light. And the controversy around Lincoln’s letter is still unfolding. During his time in office, Lincoln encountered more wounded soldiers than any other president, partly because of the Civil War’s proximity. He also spent several summers living in a cottage at the north end of the District of Columbia that was next door to an army hospital and a veterans’ retirement home. On his daily commute to the White House, carts carrying the wounded often clogged the roads. “Seeing the wounded was part of his everyday life,” said Erin Carlson Mast, the chief executive of President Lincoln’s Cottage, a historic site and museum. This exposure made Lincoln particularly empathetic about the sacrifices of soldiers, according to historians, academics and contemporaneous accounts. But that empathy may have led to a huge historical misunderstanding. In November 1864, a letter “signed by A. Lincoln” was sent to Lydia Bixby of Boston, who was recognized as “the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.” As was somewhat common for prominent correspondence at the time, the letter was published in a newspaper, The Boston Evening Transcript. The letter read: Executive Mansion, Washington, Nov. 21, 1864. Dear Madam: I have been shown, in the files of the War Department, a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts, that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom. Yours, very sincerely and respectfully, A. Lincoln The letter resonated with a weary population divided by war, and was quickly reproduced in other newspapers across the North. It appeared in The New York Times on November 26, 1864, amid other sober developments from the war’s many fronts. The legacy of the Lincoln-Bixby letter would far outlive its writer and recipient. Indeed, the controversies began many decades later. For two weeks in August 1925, a drama played out in the pages of The Times as a Bixby descendant went looking for the original copy of the text. This led to renewed interest (and scrutiny) of the famous correspondence, culminating in an exclusive Times report that two of the famous Bixby boys did not die during the war. In the coming decades, the story would keep evolving. A 1933 Times editorial was among the first speculation that the letter was actually written by Lincoln’s secretary, John Hay. Multiple pieces of reporting and books were dedicated to resolving the question of the letter’s authorship and the fate of the Bixbys. As recently as July 2017, a team of forensic linguists published research they believed confirmed Hay as the author. The circumstances of the Lincoln controversy are far different from those surrounding Mr. Trump. But the long drama around Lincoln’s correspondence shows that when private offers of condolence become public, they can mutate into an entirely different conversation.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Obamacare Moves Will Deepen Health Inequality,"Op-Ed Contributor This story was updated to reflect news developments. President Trump’s actions on Obamacare will accelerate a recent trend toward dividing the individual health insurance market between the healthy and those with chronic illness and between the wealthy and the poor. The immediate elimination of cost-sharing-reduction subsidies will have a great impact. These subsidies lower the out-of-pocket expenses for individuals who earn between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level. About seven million people qualified for C.S.R.s, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Because of the uncertainty created by the White House’s previous wavering on C.S.R.s, many insurers had already increased premiums significantly. These non-subsidized individuals will be slammed with the full burden of those hiked premiums. The move will further lower non-subsidized enrollment. Individuals who receive premium and C.S.R. subsidies will not see their costs changes. Instead, the federal government will pick up the significantly bigger tab for total subsidies. Furthermore, throughout the country, insurers may leave markets immediately or, for the 2018 plan year, withdraw their offerings. The withdrawal of C.S.R. payments has more immediate impact than the changes that will be initiated by the recent executive order to change two areas of the health insurance market. That move generated significant headlines and controversy, but its impact on the individual insurance market is probably overstated, because it represents very little structural change. The fundamental structure of the Affordable Care Act individual market will remain stable. Most people get insurance through Medicare or Medicaid or are covered by an employer and will not notice significant changes to their insurance. But there is a catch. One group of people will bear the burden of significantly, perhaps crushingly, heavier insurance premiums: those with expensive, chronic conditions who buy their insurance on the individual market but who make too much money to qualify for subsidies. These individuals — the number is extremely difficult to pin down, but one estimate for 2015 put it at somewhere around eight million people — need help from people who are paying premiums but are not using many services. Obamacare tries to build large, comprehensive “risk pools” in which the healthy and the unhealthy commingle. This has never been perfectly achieved: There are too many channels that allow low-risk individuals and groups to avoid keeping costs down for the unhealthy. This executive order dredges new channels for the healthy to segregate their costs from people with expensive care needs. The executive order instructs the Department of Labor to make a new rule to redefine association health plans so that more small groups can band together to purchase insurance. Association health plans have a long history serving the small-group market. A 2006 study estimated that 30 percent of all small-business employers insured their employees through an association health plan. Association health plans are not tightly regulated under Obamacare; it regulated fully insured direct-purchase plans in the individual and small-group markets. Large association plans are exempt from state benefit regulation and can offer narrower benefits. Furthermore, association plans can be selective; high-risk individuals would not be invited to join. Employers that remain in the A.C.A. small-group market will offer plans that are more expensive than average, and they will see premiums increase. Only the sickest groups would remain in the A.C.A. regulated risk pool after several enrollment cycles. However, the association health plan expansion is not the only factor contributing to a sicker and more expensive risk pool in A.C.A.-regulated plans. Sophisticated insurers and benefit consultants sell small-group underwritten products that are regulatory workarounds to Obamacare requirements. The executive order will exacerbate a trend that splits the small-group risk pool into low-cost and high-cost segments. Fewer small employers will be able to afford to offer the comprehensive insurance that is part of the A.C.A. This logic is powerful in the small-group market, but it is far weaker in the individual market. The executive order also instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to make a rule to reverse a 2016 regulation that limits short-term individual insurance to a single 90-day period. It would restore the status quo of the 2014 to 2016 benefit years, when limited-duration plans could have a term as long as 364 days and could be renewed. These plans often offer limited benefits, require high cost sharing and exclude individuals with pre-existing conditions. In 2015, about 148,100 people were insured under these policies at any time. The executive order will increase the relative attractiveness of underwritten short-duration plans for low-risk individuals. Plans that last 364 days and offer limited benefits to only healthy people will have low premiums for healthy people. Some healthy people will leave the regulated individual market for a better short-term deal. As healthier individuals leave the A.C.A.’s risk pool, the average health of the remaining people in the individual market risk pool will decline. Insurers won’t run from the market, but they will raise premiums to cover a sicker group of people. Higher premiums do very little harm to individuals who qualify for premium tax- credit subsidies. They are insulated from major price hikes. Who will pick up the tab for bigger subsidy checks? The United States Treasury. Single adults making more than $48,240 or families of four earning more than $98,400 will be the biggest losers. These people don’t qualify for subsidies, so they pay the full cost of the premiums. Higher premiums will come out of their hide. Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, frequently points to a constituent who already pays over $40,000 to insure his family every year. His choices will get worse. He can go without coverage, pay more, earn less so that his family can qualify for subsidies or find a job with employer-sponsored coverage. The executive order will weaken the risk pools that are regulated by the A.C.A. The proposed new rules will not go into effect instantly, and insurers will have the ability to change strategies and models in time for the 2019 open enrollment. The steps are part of a broader trend to split risk pools so that currently healthy people do not bear the burden of paying for the care of currently unhealthy people. The new executive order merely accelerates this trend toward greater health inequality. OpinionThe Editorial Board",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Opioid Directive: Is It Enough?,"Letters To the Editor: Re “In Declaration, No New Funds for Drug Crisis” (front page, Oct. 27): This announcement by President Trump is nothing more than a half-measure in lieu of more concrete action. The opioid epidemic is currently ravaging a course throughout the country. As you report, the drug crisis “claimed more than 59,000 lives in 2016.” This declaration is marked by several faults. First, this isn’t the most powerful direction the president can use: declaring this a public health emergency instead of a national emergency, which would allow rapid allocation of funds. The second and vastly more important flaw is that this directive comes with no clear funding, instead promising to work with Congress, which is notoriously slow and, judging by Puerto Rico, not in the state to handle a public emergency. The third is that President Trump’s administration currently has no drug czar or health secretary, both of whom are essential to a plan of action. All in all, this feels more like an act of showmanship rather than an act to combat a severe crisis. GLEB VERIT, NEW YORK To the Editor: Re “Words but Little Action on Opioids” (editorial, Oct. 27): Declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency is a positive development and a significant step forward. Despite failing to commit much-needed resources, the Trump administration and Congress could make a quick dent in abating this raging epidemic by taking these measures: 1) Suspend the prescription, dispensary and distribution of opioid analgesics for outpatients for 90 days. 2) Beef up law enforcement to curtail trafficking (including internet transactions) of illicit drugs across national and state borders and in communities. 3) Begin a monthlong nationwide effort to: increase public awareness; hold congressional hearings on the conduct of pharmaceutical companies and prescription drug distributors; educate policymakers and health care providers; remember the victims; and reach out, engage and care for the afflicted. GUOHUA LI, NEW YORK The writer is a professor of epidemiology and anesthesiology at Columbia. To the Editor: I understand why more than 59,000 deaths from drug overdoses in 2016 warrants a “public health emergency” directive, but I don’t understand why an average of more than 33,000 firearm deaths annually doesn’t also warrant a “public health emergency” directive.

2017,Opinion | Trump’s Road to 2024,"Roger Cohen PHOENIX — There are now two definitions of truth in the United States. The first is that a truthful statement is one that conforms to facts or reality. By this standard, President Trump is a serial liar. The second is that truth is “telling it like it is,” or speaking in a direct, unvarnished way without regard to political correctness or the offense it may give. By this measure, for millions of supporters, Trump is the most honest president ever. The United States has already become a post-truth society. Telling it like it isn’t has become a form of truth. That’s a nation in which chaos is more plausible because the ability to make rational decisions is diminished. Signal and noise can no longer be distinguished. The center, where it was long held that elections are won, evaporates. Violence becomes more likely because incomprehension grows across hardening lines of fracture. It may well be that elections, as with the last presidential race, are now won at the extremes. In Arizona, where Trump’s presidential campaign went from joke to winning proposition in July 2015 with a speech in which Trump said Mexicans were “taking our money” and “killing us,” the honest-man Trump view resonates. Trump was always about language. It didn’t matter that he was a loose cannon. He connected with the widespread disgust at the political class and the media. This was his winning intuition: that he could triumph as the subversive plain-speaking outsider. Trump had that “kind of bluntness and occasionally even crass language which, if nothing else, at least meant authenticity,” said Jay Heiler, a lawyer considering a run against Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a rare Republican critic of Trump. “The president just hit a lot of nerves that a lot of conventional politicians didn’t even know were there.” Those nerves still tingle. Nine months into the presidency, the support of Trump’s base remains fervid. I am often asked whether I believe that Trump will be impeached. I’ve taken to responding that it’s more likely he’ll be a two-term president. I’d put the chances of impeachment at under 10 percent and of his re-election at about 25 percent. That’s partly because the Democratic Party has not yet begun a serious reckoning with its defeat last year. It hasn’t grasped the degree to which it lives, still, in a coastal echo chamber of identity politics and Trump-bashing. Just being anti-Trump won’t cut it. As Chuck Coughlin, a Republican political consultant who once worked for Senator John McCain, put it to me, “Somebody who speaks to common-sense American values — that is what the Democrats need.” I’m not sure who that person is, but I am pretty sure she or he does not reside in New York, Massachusetts or California. Coughlin went on: “A Democratic Party that can’t tell me how many genders there are, that ain’t flying in this country.” American fracture is the nation’s overriding condition. It keeps widening. Jeff DeWit, the Republican state treasurer of Arizona, picked up Trump at the airport for that 2015 Phoenix rally; he remains an ardent fan of Trump’s “movement of people dying for something different.” His deputy, Mark Swenson, told me: “America was formed by a bunch of people who just wanted to be left alone.” For that, guns help. “Bad guys have guns, so good guys should have guns, too,” DeWit said, rejecting my suggestion that the recent American carnage in Las Vegas showed the need for stricter gun laws. Trump winks at white supremacists, thrives on confrontation and debases the Oval Office. But it would be a huge mistake to conclude from this that his defeat is inevitable; or that his supporters do not include millions of decent, smart Americans who just view the world differently. Americans who feel culturally alienated from the globalized metropolis (and sense that their worldview elicits contempt in a Democratic Party that often seems to have lost touch with ordinary Americans). Heiler, the pro-Trump lawyer considering a Senate run, turned to the president’s campaign against football players, most of them black, who refuse to stand for the national anthem. “Many African-Americans are focused on a particular set of facts and circumstances” that “drive that conduct, that protest,” Heiler said. “But when many other Americans see it, and Americans of all races,” they think “gosh, these guys all have it pretty good. You know they make a really good living, playing football. This country’s been really good to them. And so, even if they have an ax to grind, they shouldn’t grind it against the country or its symbol or its anthem.” Heiler said he wouldn’t condemn the protesting players’ choice, even if he disagreed, but “there’s simply no getting around that when you make that choice you’re going to alienate a lot of Americans.” Now the vague particular “circumstances” alluded to by Heiler includes gross police brutality against black kids and the history of oppression of African-Americans. Players who protest are exercising a fundamental American right. But yes, they are “going to alienate a lot of Americans.” Trump, at some level, is going to win this argument. An overriding lesson of 2016 for liberals is that without hard-nosed realism about the state of the country and Trump’s talents, you lose. And that’s the truth.",The New York Times
2017,"Opinion | Trump’s Scandals, a List","David Leonhardt Updated Feb. 1, 2018 The list of Trump scandals keeps growing. “Amid the chaos and dysfunction,” Slate’s Jamelle Bouie writes, “it can be easy to miss that this White House is corrupt. Remarkably, unbelievably, corrupt.” Given the number of potential scandals involving personal enrichment — of President Trump, his family or top administration officials — I wanted to create a list of all the major ones. Here goes: • The presidency is benefiting Trump’s business in numerous ways. Government officials have stayed in hotels that bear Trump’s name, for example, while some foreign government officials have taken steps to curry favor by better accommodating Trump-branded properties in their countries. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club doubled its membership rates after he won the White House. Trump’s companies sold more than $35 million in real estate last year, according to one report. Many of the sales went to opaque shell companies, which hide the buyers’ identities, and flow into a trust the president may access. Trump International Realty, run by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s sons, is seeking new business in South Florida. Also: Eric Trump has been giving his father quarterly updates on the financial health of his businesses, despite promises that the president would have no involvement. Those businesses have also done deals with foreign governments, despite the president’s pledge that they wouldn’t. • Trump has spent more than $30 million of taxpayer money traveling to properties he owns, by one estimate. • Ryan Zinke, Trump’s secretary of the interior, is under investigation for chartering a $12,000 flight from Las Vegas to Montana at taxpayers’ expense. Zinke also failed to disclose an investment in a Montana gun company, booked a $12,000 flight on an oil executive’s plane, spent almost $40,000 of a wildfire preparedness fund to pay for flights and paid $6,000 for a helicopter trip to visit Vice President Mike Pence. • David Shulkin, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, charged taxpayers for a trip to Europe that included stopovers at Wimbledon and Westminster Abbey, plus a river cruise for him and his wife. • Scott Pruitt, who runs the Environmental Protection Agency, regularly dines with donors and lobbyists from industries his department is regulating. He also used public money to pay for a soundproof booth in his office and chartered private and military overseas flights. • Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, tried to use a government plane to fly him to Europe for his honeymoon. He may also have availed himself of a taxpayer-funded military plane to view the solar eclipse in August, though he says the trip had a different purpose. The Treasury Department’s inspector general concluded in October that Mnuchin broke no laws when he spent $800,000 to travel on military planes. But the inspector general also criticized Mnuchin’s insufficient explanation for why he needed to spend so much taxpayer money. “What is of concern is a disconnect between the standard of proof called for,” the inspector general wrote, “and the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests.” • Tom Price, the former secretary of health and human services who resigned in September, spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on private planes. Trump hired Price despite Price’s history of using his position in Congress to receive sweetheart stock deals. • Despite Trump’s spending only eight days in Trump Tower as president so far, the government has spent $130,000 per month since April to lease space in the building for a military office that supports the White House. •Despite counterintelligence warnings that Chinese officials might be trying to curry favor with him to advance China’s interests, Jared Kushner has reportedly used his closeness with Trump to secure foreign investment in Kushner’s family-owned business, in exchange for granting visas. • A Chinese government office approved trademarks for a company owned by Ivanka Trump on the same day that China’s president met with President Trump. • Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, may have used his position to curry favor with a Russian oligarch as part of a long-running money-laundering and tax-evasion scheme, according to charges brought against him by Robert Mueller, the special counsel. • Michael Flynn lobbied on behalf of the Turkish government, but Trump selected him as national security adviser anyway (before later ousting him). • Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, promoted Ivanka’s fashion line on television. • As The New Yorker, ProPublica and the public radio station WNYC reported, longtime Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz donated or solicited more than $50,000 on behalf of a Manhattan district attorney who later dropped a case against Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. • Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser to her father, owns a stake in a Trump-branded luxury hotel in Washington valued at between $5 million and $25 million. • K.T. McFarland, Trump’s former deputy national security adviser, may have violated federal law by using over $13,000 in campaign funds to boost her work as a media figure. • Rebeckah Adcock, a top Department of Agriculture deregulation official, met with pesticide lobbyists from her former employer and discussed issues related to her previous lobbying. • A charity led by Eric Trump paid over $145,000 to properties owned by his father during the election. Despite pledging not to raise money for the organization after his resignation in December 2016, Eric has continued to attend fundraisers held at Trump properties. • Brenda Fitzgerald, Trump’s former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, purchased shares in food, drug and tobacco companies after taking charge of an agency that aims to reduce smoking. She resigned in January. • Despite warnings to follow ethics rules, Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, let his son help organize an agency event and invite individuals with whom he had potential business dealings. • The administration has eliminated regulations that were lobbied against by a company owned by a member of the president’s infrastructure council. Other members of the council — several with longstanding personal connections to Trump — hold investments in industries that would benefit from increased infrastructure spending. • And there are likely some scandals we don’t know about because, unlike other modern presidents and candidates, Trump has refused to release his tax returns.

2017,Opinion | Trump’s Scary Strategy on North Korea,"Nicholas Kristof On just the first day of a war between the United States and North Korea, according to a Stanford University assessment, one million people could be killed. Yet after my five-day visit to North Korea with three New York Times colleagues, such a nuclear war seems terrifyingly imaginable. In the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, it was clear that President Trump’s threat to “totally destroy” North Korea had backfired and is being exploited by Kim Jong-un for his own propaganda and military mobilization. The country has seized on Trump’s words to reinforce its official narrative that its nuclear arsenal is defensive, meant to protect Koreans from bullying American imperialists. And North Korean officials use Trump’s bombast as an excuse for their own. “The American Trump uttered nonsense about demolishing our country,” a military officer, Lt. Col. Hwang Myong-jin, told me. “So as soon as our supreme leader gives us an order, we will turn the entire country of the U.S. into fire.” One typical propaganda image shows a powerful North Korean soldier stepping on the face of an evil-looking blond American soldier and reads, “Death to invaders.” Kim doesn’t want to appear weak and seem as if he is caving to American pressure, and officials in North Korea repeatedly cited Trump’s threats to justify their military mobilization and their reluctance to engage in dialogue or conciliation. “The current Trump administration’s aggressive remarks about how he can totally destroy my country make it unthinkable that we can start any dialogue,” said Ri Yong-pil, a senior Foreign Ministry official. My visit left me thinking that Trump’s entire strategy rests on a series of fundamental and dangerous misconceptions. The first misconception is that sanctions and talk of war will lead North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Every North Korean official we spoke to insisted that this was impossible, and the U.S. intelligence community likewise believes that this just won’t happen, for (as I mentioned in my last column) North Korea sees nuclear warheads as crucial to its survival. We did see signs that sanctions are biting, for businessmen complained about China cracking down on trade; gas prices have doubled; and electricity is rationed. Power outages are routine even in the capital. Yet solar panels are becoming more common, and Kim has moved to liberalize the economy in ways that generate growth despite sanctions. Collective farms are allowing greater use of private plots, factory managers enjoy more responsibility to turn profits and street markets are more tolerated than before. The bite of sanctions on elites is also dulled by a Kim initiative to inject a bit of fun into life in the capital (special permission is needed for North Koreans to visit Pyongyang, let alone live there). This is still the most totalitarian country in the world, but it does have an amusement park, a water park, a ski area and a dolphin show — North Korea’s version of SeaWorld. (I genuinely enjoyed the dolphin show, until it ended with wide-screen images of missiles.) Economic reforms helped generate G.D.P. growth, after long stagnation, of 3.9 percent last year, according to South Korea’s central bank. That’s more than twice the growth rate last year in the U.S. of 1.6 percent. The second American misconception is that China can transform North Korean behavior. We’ve always exaggerated Chinese influence on North Korea. Kim has gone out of his way to humiliate President Xi Jinping, and Chinese officials fear that this will happen again this month with a missile launch or nuclear test during China’s 19th Communist Party Congress. North Korea has refused even to allow a visit by the Chinese point man for North Korean affairs, Kong Xuanyou. “We know what Kong would say, so he doesn’t need to say it here,” one North Korean official told me scornfully. The third American misconception is the assumption that the North Korean regime is near collapse, and that huffing and puffing will accelerate this. In the early 1990s my wife and I chose to be Tokyo correspondents for The Times partly because that would enable us to cover North Korea — and its impending collapse. We’re still waiting. Yes, at some point it’ll happen, but don’t count on it tomorrow. And the economic reforms, however modest, may give the regime a bit more life. Trump has genuinely increased the economic pressure on North Korea through United Nations sanctions, and the pinch may increase. But one of the worst mistakes in international relations, plaguing us from Vietnam to Iraq, is to operate on wishful thinking rather than reality, and I fear that’s what’s happening here in a perilous way. To be blunt, Trump’s strategy frightens me. In speech and through Twitter, he is escalating a conflict and trumpeting military options as he insists on a goal of denuclearization that is unachievable, a tactic of Chinese pressure that is unrealistic and a premise of regime fragility that is wishful thinking. That’s how wars happen. OpinionNicholas Kristof OpinionNicholas Kristof OpinionSe-Woong Koo",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Self-Absorption on War Deaths,"Andrew Rosenthal President Trump was right about one thing this week (look, it happens). It is extremely hard to tell someone that their husband or wife or son or daughter has been killed while fighting in the country’s uniform. Well, it should be. Every service member who dies in one of America’s wars gives up his life in following the orders of the commander -n chief. And that commander in chief — no matter how self-absorbed — should take personal responsibility for it. But Trump could not have been more wrong in how he handled questions about whether he made calls to the next of kin to the four American soldiers who were killed in Niger on Oct. 4. Then again, there was so much wrong with the way he handled this issue. First, he indicated he had not already made the calls. “I will at some point during the period of time,” he said. Which period of time? Who knows. Then, in true Trump fashion, he made it all about the most important person in any conversation, himself. Saying that those notifications are “a very difficult thing,” the president started whining, “Now it gets to a point where you make four or five of them in one day, it’s a very, very tough day.” Imagine having to sacrifice time from tweeting inanities, stealing health insurance coverage from working Americans, passing tax breaks for his fellow billionaires, and other really pressing stuff. (And, by the way, if he goes through with his threat to attack North Korea, it’s going to be four or five thousand calls a day — if the casualties are low. Very, very, very tough.) Then, still true to form, Trump tried to make the claim that he was actually much better at this solemn duty than anyone else, especially Barack Obama. “If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls, a lot of them didn’t make calls,” he said, absolutely falsely. “I like to call when it’s appropriate, when I think I’m able to do it.” Trump admitted under further questioning at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden that he didn’t actually know what Barack Obama’s practice was. “I don’t know if he did it,” Trump said. “I was told that he didn’t often.” In fact, Obama frequently made calls, always wrote letters and regularly met with Gold Star families. Today, in an interview with a Fox radio host, Trump actually dragged in the 2010 battlefield death of Second Lt. Robert Kelly, the son of Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly. “I mean, you could ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama,” Trump said. (By the way, Trump’s endless need to bring up Obama all the time is passing strange. Is this president ever going to become anything than merely the Bizarro Obama?) The issue here, as Trump likes to say about the playing of the national anthem at football games, is one of respect and honor. In the culture of the military, a job in which the possibility of dying is ever-present, the proper way to treat death is with dignity and respect. And the commander in chief should take personal responsibility. Ronald Reagan, for example, attended the memorial service for the 241 Marines and other service members killed in the bombing of a barracks in Beirut in 1983. President George W. Bush tried to hide the casualties of war from the American public by barring the media from Dover Air Force Base when flag-draped coffins returned from Iraq. He did not attend the funerals of the fallen. Trump, by contrast, sat joking with Sean Hannity at an event in Harrisburg, Pa., last week, while the military color guard was lowering the flag to the playing of “Retreat” — a deeply solemn daily ritual. “What a nice sound that is,” Trump said. “Are they playing that for you or for me?” I don’t mean to suggest that Trump is so lacking in basic empathy that he doesn’t care about the war dead. But he is careless, in exactly the way that F. Scott Fitzgerald described two of the main characters in “The Great Gatsby”: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Sellout of American Heritage,"Timothy Egan The last runs of heavenly wild salmon are trickling in this month, the buttery coho with flesh the color of fall foliage. After that, we’ll have to settle for mostly farmed and frozen fish until next spring — no substitute for the real deal. We can count on this seasonal miracle, healthy fish returning to their birthplaces and then on to the dinner table, so long as the fragile balance of nature remains intact. But with a president who is going after clean air, clean water and the world’s most valuable wild salmon fishery, the fate of creation and all the myriad wonders within it is at stake. I use “creation” as an appeal to creationists to look at what your president is doing to Eden, or what’s left of it. I also want to appeal to economic nationalists. For the U.S.A. has the greatest home for sockeye salmon on the planet in Alaska’s Bristol Bay. The Trump administration is putting it at risk in order to aid a foreign mining conglomerate. This American carnage is led by a man whose job is to protect the natural world within our borders, the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt. As you may have heard, he has sealed himself off from the public with a $25,000 phone security system and an 18-member security detail. It took a court order to pry loose some of the details of his meetings. No surprise, he holds daily lap-dog sessions with the companies he is supposed to regulate. Pruitt is the swamp, the only wetland the Trump administration wants to protect. He serves the oil, chemical and mining interests that propped him up when he was attorney general of Oklahoma. He now runs the oil, chemical and mining protection agency out of Washington, with our money. You would never guess that this toady in a suit works for us. Look around. The catastrophic wildfires that are sweeping through iconic landscapes in Northern California and carpet-bombing entire neighborhoods are a glimpse into an early future in the West. Hurricanes, rolling in one after the other, are swamping cities. Every month brings a new high temperature record. Until this year, the American response was in tune with the rest of the world — to try to do something to fix this overheated globe of ours. In announcing this week that President Trump intends to spite all the other nations and gut President Barack Obama’s signature effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Pruitt framed the move as the end of the “war on coal.” Now comes the war on the planet and public health. Amid the hourly calamities of a White House that is forced to treat its chief occupant like a toddler, it’s easy to forget that Trump is doing real damage to things that all of us share. So, that’s politics, right? To the victor go the spoils. He’s simply rolling back onerous regulations, as promised, and sticking it to the global elites on climate change. Well, no. Your party affiliation will not protect you from the chemicals sprayed on strawberries — shown to cause brain damage to children — which Trump will allow to remain in the food chain. Living in a red state will not keep warming oceans from rising ever higher when the latest 500-year storm hits your region. Being a Trump supporter does not protect your favorite stream from the toxic discharge of a power plant into a public waterway. All of the above are potential consequences of more than 50 environmental rules that Trump has tried to kill since he took office. National monuments — not the Confederate kind that Trump wants to preserve, but special places protected in somewhat the same way as national parks — are also in his sights. These are unique landscapes set aside for their cultural, historical or scenic splendor. Trump could shrink 10 of them — another sellout of American heritage. In Alaska, he is going against the will of the people to target Bristol Bay. Half the world’s wild sockeye come from this magical place, a bounty that supports 14,000 jobs. Alaskans are a cantankerous bunch who can’t agree on much of anything. Yet they voted by an overwhelming margin in 2014 to protect Bristol Bay from a gold and copper mine that could generate 10 billion tons of toxic waste. And unlike big food producers in the heartland, the Bristol Bay salmon industry is not propped up by subsidies, chemicals or compromised politicians. The fish need only clean water and healthy oceans. That’s why the E.P.A. had earlier concluded that the proposed Pebble mine could have a “catastrophic” impact on the bay. Trump’s men are rolling over for the gold mine. Just hours after Pruitt met with the mine’s corporate leadership, Trump reversed E.P.A. protection, as CNN reported this week. If you’re surprised that wild salmon would be sacrificed for precious metal, remember that one of Trump’s few passions is for gold-plated bathroom fixtures.",The New York Times
2017,"Trump’s Sketch of Empire State Building Fetches $16,000 at Auction","A black-marker drawing of the Empire State Building by President Trump — an artifact from his days as a voracious Manhattan real estate mogul — sold at auction Thursday night for $16,000. According to Julien’s Auctions in Los Angeles, where the sale took place, Mr. Trump created the 12-by-9-inch drawing at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for a charity auction that took place in 1995. At the time, the signed sketch sold for less than $100. It’s not the first work of art by Mr. Trump to fall into the eager hands of collectors in the wake of his presidency. In July, a similarly sized drawing of a more comprehensive Manhattan skyline sold for $29,000 at Nate D. Sanders Auctions. Mr. Trump’s history with the Empire State Building fills a dramatic chapter in the annals of hallowed Manhattan real estate. In 1994, Mr. Trump announced that he’d acquired 50 percent of the title to the 102-story Fifth Avenue icon, which he claimed had fallen from its “rightful position as a world-class real-estate asset.” The holders of the master lease to the tower, including Peter L. Malkin and Leona Helmsley of Empire State Building Associates, disagreed, and a lengthy legal battle ensued as Mr. Trump sought to usurp them. In 2002, he and the title’s other owner relented, selling it to Mr. Malkin and Ms. Helmsley’s group for $57.5 million. Mr. Trump’s sketch was created while he was still pursuing the prized property. A representative of Julien’s Auctions wrote in a statement that the artwork “symbolized his ascent” through the ranks of New York power brokers. A portion of the proceeds, to be matched by the auction house, will go to a National Public Radio station in Connecticut. The buyer was not identified.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Tax Plan: What It Does and Doesn’t Do,"Letters To the Editor: “Tax Cuts Won’t Create Jobs,” by Marcus Ryu (Op-Ed, Oct. 9), proposes that the purpose of the unified tax plan is to persuade more high-tech entrepreneurs to create start-ups. But this is not the purpose of President Trump’s plan. Its purpose is to make our tax code simpler and fairer, grow the economy and increase wage growth for hard-working Americans. A reasonable reduction in corporate tax rates will incentivize increased corporate investment in both existing and new endeavors. A reduced corporate tax rate facilitates an improved rate of return on new projects and leaves companies with more equity with which to fund them and bring back earnings trapped overseas, making companies more likely to fund projects in the United States. Mr. Ryu goes on to argue that government is a better allocator of capital than the private sector. History shows otherwise: Think back to the messes at Fannie and Freddie and the “Bridge to Nowhere” in Alaska. Regarding “Cohn and Mnuchin Risk Reputations,” by David Leonhardt (column, Oct. 9): The details of the tax bill have not yet been released, so there is no empirical basis for the headline’s claim. In fact, the framework explicitly says tax reform will result in a system at least as progressive as current law, and it will not shift the tax burden to low- and middle-income households from high-income households. The framework gives the congressional committees the flexibility to add a top tax rate on the highest incomes to meet these goals. Done right, we can restore fundamental fairness and economic opportunity. WILBUR ROSS, WASHINGTON The writer is secretary of commerce. To the Editor: Re “Tax Cuts Won’t Create Jobs”: I couldn’t agree more. To Marcus Ryu’s examples of companies created at a time of high taxes, one could also add Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who created Ben & Jerry’s in 1978, when the maximum tax rate was 70 percent; Howard Schultz, the founder of Il Giornale, the predecessor of Starbucks in 1986, when the maximum tax rate was 50 percent; and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google in 1998, when the maximum rate was 39.6 percent. The notion that low tax rates create jobs is nonsense, and if one needs recent proof of the damage this misguided theory caused, simply look at the experiment of Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, who promised that his big cut in tax rates would create jobs and explosive economic growth. The result was a large deficit and the necessity, three years later, to dramatically increase taxes to mitigate the damage, an action taken by his fellow Republicans, overriding his veto. ROBERT H. MILLER, NEW YORK The writer, a retired senior executive for a Fortune 500 company, is the author of “If Low Taxes Create Jobs, Where Are They?”",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Top Economist Says Corporate Tax Cuts Will Lift Workers’ Wages,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s top economist said on Monday that a corporate tax cut being pushed by Republicans would increase a typical household’s income by $3,000 to $7,000 a year, highlighting a primary argument the administration will make in drafting and selling its tax plan. A report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers is the first official calculation of the tax framework’s impact and its focus on cutting corporate rates underscores how central that effort is to the administration’s overall plan. Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers have been selling their framework as a middle-class tax cut, saying the plan will put money back in workers’ pockets, including by lowering the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The Council of Economic Advisers report argues that high corporate taxes hurt workers in the form of smaller paychecks and that worker incomes rise sharply when corporate rates fall. It points to “the deteriorating relationship between wages of American workers and U.S. corporate profits” and says, essentially, that high corporate taxes have encouraged companies to shift capital abroad rather than flow profits to workers through pay increases. Its conclusions drew swift condemnation from many Democrats and liberal economists, who accused the administration of “cherry-picking” economic evidence to sweeten Mr. Trump’s pitch to American workers. Senator Chuck Schumer, the New Yorker who leads Senate Democrats, called the report “fake math” and said history showed tax cuts in the mold of the Republican plan “benefit the wealthy and the powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.” Other research has cast doubt on the theory that businesses would pass tax savings on to their workers in the form of higher wages. A 2012 Treasury Department study, which Treasury recently removed from its website, found that less than a fifth of the corporate tax falls on workers. A Congressional Research Service report last month concluded that the effects of corporate taxes fell largely on high-income Americans, not average workers. The president, signaling how heavily the administration will lean on the argument that a corporate tax cut will help workers, said in a speech in Pennsylvania last week that the proposal would most “likely give the typical American household a $4,000 pay raise.” The council is led by Kevin Hassett, an economist whose previous academic work has argued that high corporate tax rates hurt workers. The report does not attempt to analyze the full Republican proposal, which still lacks many key details, including the individual income ranges for tax brackets, the rules to qualify for certain lower business tax rates and possible methods to prevent multinational corporations from avoiding taxes by channeling profits to ultra-low-tax countries. Instead, it focuses on one detail that Mr. Trump has insisted is not negotiable: the reduction in the top corporate income tax rate. The report draws heavily on several economic studies that find results similar to Mr. Hassett’s, including that the so-called incidence of corporate taxation falls mainly on workers, meaning they have much to gain if such rates are cut. One of the studies it cites uses international data to estimate the magnitude of wage growth countries could initiate by cutting corporate rates; another performs a similar estimate using state-level data. The council’s report concludes that if the corporate rate were cut to 20 percent, the median American household would earn $3,000 to $7,000 more than it otherwise would have. The median household earns just under $60,000 a year. Mr. Hassett said in a conference call with reporters that those gains could be even larger than the calculations suggested, “because America’s broken corporate tax system creates incentives for firms to hold their profits outside our borders.” Another report issued on Monday from three economists at Boston University used an economic model to predict similarly large income gains from the Republican tax framework, though it warned that the plan would likely widen income inequality. That model assumes that the burden of corporate taxes falls almost entirely on workers. A prominent conservative economist, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the American Action Forum in Washington and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said on Monday that the council’s projections represented “a reasonable, back-of-the envelope calculation,” drawn from empirical research. He said gains to workers from a corporate rate cut would have a far greater impact on their living standards than the framework’s proposed changes to the individual income tax code, such as doubling the size of the standard deduction. “The most important things for the middle class are not on the piece of paper,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, referring to the details of the individual income tax plan. “Do real wages rise, do standards of living increase? The specifics of the plan — the bigger standard deduction, etc. — are small potatoes compared to that. There’s a bigger game here, and the C.E.A. report is a reminder of that bigger game.” Liberal researchers accused the Trump administration on Monday of ignoring studies that showed few benefits from corporate tax cuts for average workers and relying on research that supported a politically desirable result. Seth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress think tank and a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said Mr. Hassett had “cherry-picked” studies on the effects of corporate taxation on wages. Jason Furman, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School and a former Council of Economic Advisers chairman in the Obama administration, called Mr. Hassett’s findings “implausible” and noted they were rooted in studies that had not been published in major academic journals. “This lies outside the mainstream of economists,” he said.",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Tough Talk on Nafta Raises Prospects of Pact’s Demise,"WASHINGTON — The North American Free Trade Agreement, long disparaged by President Trump as bad for the United States, was edging closer toward collapse as negotiators gathered for a fourth round of contentious talks here this week. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has sparred with American businesses that support Nafta and has pushed for significant changes that negotiators from Mexico and Canada say are nonstarters. All the while, the president has continued threatening to withdraw the United States from the trade agreement, which he has maligned as the worst in history. As the trade talks began on Wednesday, Mr. Trump, seated in the Oval Office beside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, said it was “possible” that the United States would drop out of Nafta. “It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” the president said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers. And in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also. So we’ll see what happens with Nafta, but I’ve been opposed to Nafta for a long time, in terms of the fairness of Nafta.” Mr. Trudeau, in comments later at the Canadian Embassy, said he remains optimistic about the potential for a Nafta deal but noted that Canadians must be “ready for anything.” The collapse of the 1994 trade deal would reverberate throughout the global economy, inflicting damage far beyond Mexico, Canada and the United States and affecting industries as varied as manufacturing, agriculture and energy. It would also sow at least short-term chaos for businesses like the auto industry that have arranged their North American supply chains around the deal’s terms. The ripple effects could also impede other aspects of the president’s agenda, for example, by solidifying political opposition among farm state Republicans who support the pact and jeopardizing legislative priorities like tax reform. And it could have far-reaching political effects, including the Mexican general election in July 2018 and Mr. Trump’s own re-election campaign. Business leaders have become spooked by the increasing odds of the trade deal’s demise, and on Monday, more than 310 state and local chambers of commerce sent a letter to the administration urging the United States to remain in Nafta. Speaking in Mexico on Tuesday, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, said the negotiations had “reached a critical moment. And the chamber has had no choice but ring the alarm bells.” “Let me be forceful and direct,” he said. “There are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal.” The potential demise of the trade deal prompted supportive messages from labor unions, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Steelworkers, as well as some Democrats. “Any trade proposal that makes multinational corporations nervous is a good sign that it’s moving in the right direction for workers,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. If the deal does fall apart, the United States, Canada and Mexico would revert to average tariffs that are relatively low — just a few percent in most cases. But several agricultural products would face much higher duties. American farmers would see a 25 percent tariff on shipments of beef, 45 percent on turkey and some dairy products, and 75 percent on chicken, potatoes and high fructose corn syrup sent to Mexico. For months, some of the most powerful business leaders in the country, and the lobbies and political figures that represent them, had hoped that the president’s strong wording was more a negotiating tactic than a real threat and that he would ultimately go along with their agenda of modernization. Nafta is nearly a quarter-century old, and people across the political spectrum say it should be updated for the 21st century while preserving the open trading system that has linked the North American economy. The pact has allowed industries to reorganize their supply chains around the continent to take advantage of the three countries’ differing resources and strengths, lifting the continent’s economies and more than tripling America’s trade with Canada and Mexico since its inception. Economists contend that many workers have benefited from these changes in the form of higher wages and employment, but many workers have lost their jobs as manufacturing plants relocated to Mexico or Canada, making Nafta a target of labor unions, many Democrats and a few industries. But most business leaders had hoped that the president, whose Nafta criticism has been unrelenting, would be content to oversee tweaks to modernize the agreement, and then call it a political transformation. It sometimes looked as if that might be the case. The appointment of Robert Lighthizer as United States trade representative, who pledged in his confirmation hearing to “do no harm” to Nafta, reassured many on Capitol Hill, where Mr. Lighthizer had long served in aide roles. And when the administration released its negotiating goals in July for the deal, they echoed many priorities of previous administrations. But now, eight weeks into trade talks that were originally supposed to conclude by year’s end, the administration continues to push for concessions that the business community warns would essentially undermine the pact, and which few observers believe Canada and Mexico could agree to politically. “Everyone knows that much of what is being proposed in key areas are, in effect, non-starters, which begs the question as to what, exactly, the administration is trying to achieve,” Michael Camuñez, a former assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama, wrote in an email. It’s not unreasonable to think that by accommodating the president’s most extreme positions, American negotiators are “simply giving Trump cover to do what he really wants: withdraw from the agreement,” he said. Phil Levy, a trade adviser for the George W. Bush administration, said the president was most likely looking for a pretext to kill Nafta. “Find me the last trade agreement that U.S. passed with the chamber in opposition,” Mr. Levy said. “You don’t have a chance. It’s hard enough with the U.S. Chamber in favor.” The most controversial of the administration’s proposals, floated by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, would incorporate a sunset clause in the deal, causing Nafta to automatically expire unless all three countries voted periodically to continue it. That provision has drawn swift condemnation from the chamber and other industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers, which say that it would instill so much uncertainty in the future of Nafta that it would basically nullify the trade agreement. Another contentious push by the United States centers on changing Nafta’s rules governing how much of a product needs to be made in North America in order to enjoy tariff-free trade between the countries. The United States is pushing for higher levels, including a requirement to make 85 percent of the value of automobiles and auto parts in North America, up from 62.5 percent currently, and an additional requirement for 50 percent of the value to come from the United States. That has pitted some of the world’s biggest auto companies against the Trump administration. Industry representatives say such high and complex barriers could deter companies from manufacturing in the United States altogether. The administration has also proposed limits on the number of federal government contracts that Mexican and Canadian companies can win, as well as significant changes to how disputes are resolved under Nafta. Business groups say they are firmly opposed to an American push to curtail a provision called investor-state dispute settlement, which allows companies to sue Canada, Mexico and the United States for unfair treatment under Nafta. Meanwhile, Canada has said that it will not consider dispensing with another provision, Nafta’s Chapter 19, which allows countries to challenge each other’s anti-dumping and countervailing duty decisions before an independent panel. In his remarks Tuesday, Mr. Donohue called the administration’s proposed changes to these provisions “unnecessary and unacceptable.” Mr. Donohue’s remarks followed a sharp exchange of words between the Chamber of Commerce, the country’s most powerful business lobby, and the Trump administration on Friday. John Murphy, senior vice president of international policy for the chamber, said the administration’s proposals had “no identifiable constituency backing them” and had sparked “a remarkable degree of unity in their rejection.” He added that business leaders had perhaps never been at odds with an administration over a trade negotiation on so many fronts. Hours later, the administration fired back. “The president has been clear that Nafta has been a disaster for many Americans, and achieving his objectives requires substantial change,” said Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the trade representative. “These changes of course will be opposed by entrenched Washington lobbyists and trade associations. We have always understood that draining the swamp would be controversial in Washington.” Mr. Trump is known for taking a tough negotiating stance, and analysts said the administration might view its ambitious opening requests as a way to gain more leverage in the Nafta negotiations. But Mr. Murphy and others in the business community cautioned that such an approach would probably be ill-fated. In both Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump is unpopular, and caving to his demands could have devastating consequences for local politicians. Mexican government officials have repeatedly said they would not negotiate with a gun to the head. “There’s an old adage in negotiations, never take a hostage you wouldn’t shoot,” Mr. Murphy said.",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Trade Endgame Could Be the Undoing of Global Rules,"Economic Scene What if President Trump’s ultimate goal is to kill the World Trade Organization? When Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, cut his teeth on trade diplomacy, back during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, the United States had an idiosyncratic way of solving its grievances over trade: asking its trading partners to curb their exports, or else. In the early 1980s, Japan signed on to “voluntary export restraints” to curb the exports of Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans that were causing so much heartburn in Detroit. “Voluntary restraint agreements” were negotiated with 15 countries that accounted for 80 percent of American steel imports. They were voluntary in the sense that foreign exporters preferred these agreements over the threat of punitive duties. In Washington, they were popular. As the Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin notes in his timely new book, “Clashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy,” the share of American imports covered by some form of trade restriction rose to 21 percent in 1984, from only 8 percent in 1975. Today, trade grievances are adjudicated differently: Since 1995, the United States has been required, like any other country, to take its complaints to the World Trade Organization’s dispute settlement system. It has lost some cases, especially those against Washington’s unique way of measuring dumping. But it tends to win when it brings a charge against some unfair practice abroad. Taking account as Mr. Trump’s trade negotiators talk tough to their Mexican and Canadian counterparts as they try to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, some diplomats and trade experts are beginning to wonder whether the administration’s ultimate goal is to blow up the entire legal framework governing world trade. What Washington truly seems to want is the kind of free hand it had in the 1980s to coerce one country after another into bringing its surplus with the United States down to zero. According to a trade diplomat who is aware of the goings-on, American negotiators have warned Mexicans and Canadians that if the United States leaves Nafta, they shouldn’t expect trade relations to simply snap back to W.T.O. rules, which include a tariff ceiling of 3.5 percent, on average, for Mexican exports to the United States and 7.1 percent for American exports to Mexico. The United States, they argue, won’t be bound by these constraints. Asked for comment, Mr. Lighthizer’s office referred me to a statement from June in which he affirmed his “commitment to working closely with U.S. trading partners to increase the W.T.O.’s ability to promote free and fair trade.” But he has not been shy about expressing his gripes about the organization. Meanwhile, the United States has been chipping away at its judicial apparatus, blocking appointments to the seven-member appellate body that rules on trade disputes. The court is now two members short and will be down three when the European jurist steps down in December. The impasse prompted Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union’s top trade diplomat, to warn that the American position risks “killing the W.T.O. from the inside.” While emasculating the trade organization may seem foolhardy, trade experts warn that blowing up international trade law may be the only way the Trump administration could pursue its quixotic goal of eliminating the bilateral trade deficits that it has with most countries. And that presents the world with a sort of Catch-22. The American current account deficit — a broad measure of its trade — is the mirror image of the gap between the United States’ national savings and its national investment. Because it invests more than it saves, it draws money from abroad and spends it on foreign goods and services. Until it closes the savings gap, no amount of diplomacy, bullying or cajoling will close the gap in trade. If the United States leaves Nafta, it’s possible that its deficit with Mexico will balloon rather than shrink, as uncertainty sends the peso into a tailspin and makes Mexican exports cheaper. But even if Mr. Trump’s Nafta gambit worked and bilateral trade came into balance, it wouldn’t necessarily change the balance of American trade over all. Mr. Lighthizer might remember that after Canada, Japan and the European Community agreed in the early 1980s to voluntary restraint agreements limiting exports of steel to the United States, producers in countries like South Korea and South Africa simply picked up the slack. As another Dartmouth economist, Robert Staiger, told me, unless the American savings-investment imbalance corrected itself, too, the former deficit with Mexico would simply pop up somewhere else. “Bilateral deficits are going to keep popping up everywhere,” he said. “Trump is going to be playing Whac-a-Mole.” And if Republicans pass their smorgasbord of tax cuts, the mushrooming budget deficit will push the savings-investment imbalance in exactly the wrong direction. The problem for the rest of the world is that any of these situations is likely to produce great frustration in an administration that appears to believe trade balances are negotiated like real estate deals. They all put the United States on a collision course with the legal regime administered by the W.T.O. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to pull the United States out of the trade regime governed by W.T.O., or even out of Nafta. Rufus Yerxa, a former top American trade diplomat on the team that negotiated both Nafta and the Uruguay Round of multilateral talks that led to the creation of the W.T.O. in 1995, argues that whatever the legalities, the thought that Mr. Trump may pull the United States out of the trade organization is not credible. The losses, he said, would be far too steep. Countries would discriminate at will against American products and services. “Everybody in the world could do anything they wanted to do to us,” Mr. Yerxa said. The sprawling supply chains that American companies have laid out across the world since the trade organization came into being would be under threat. Chad P. Bown, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agreed. “It would hurt economic activity much more than in the 1980s,” he said. “So much trade back then was in final goods. Now a lot is in intermediate parts.” It was easy to bully Japan in the 1980s. Its security depended on the United States. It’s unlikely that Washington could pull off the same thing with China today. Though the W.T.O. would suffer a blow if the United States left, it might survive it. Today the United States accounts for only about 13 percent of world trade, down from almost a quarter in the 1980s. What’s most mystifying to foreign diplomats and trade policy experts is how the Trump administration conceives the endgame of bringing down a legal system the United States spent so much time and effort to build. Even if Mr. Trump prevails, the United States stands to lose. American sugar policy comes to mind. In the early 1980s, hoping to put a floor on prices in the United States, the government set up a quota system to limit sugar imports. As Professor Irwin tells it, the enterprise proved more difficult than the experts in Washington ever thought. The American import quota got smaller and smaller to keep pace with falling prices worldwide. At one point, American sugar was so expensive that companies started importing sugary products like cake mix, iced tea and cocoa in bulk to extract and sell the sugar within. Coke and Pepsi switched from sugar to corn syrup, slashing domestic demand and forcing the Agriculture Department to reduce import quotas further. And candy makers moved abroad, to where sugar was cheaper. In the Caribbean and Central America, sugar quotas led farmers to stop producing sugar and start cultivating illegal narcotics that were smuggled into the United States. To cap it all, in August 1986 the United States sold China 136,000 tons of sugar it had accumulated in its efforts to bolster the price. It was sugar it bought at 18 cents a pound. It sold at 5 cents. Within days, world sugar prices plummeted. Robert Lighthizer has been involved in international trade diplomacy long enough to remember this kind of go-it-alone trade strategy. He doesn’t appear to have learned the lessons history has taught us since then.

2017,Opinion | Trump’s War Games,"Charles M. Blow Don’t say that we weren’t warned. In a September 2015 speech before the National Press Club in Washington, the Louisiana governor and Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal said: “Donald Trump is dangerous. But not in the way you think. Many people think he’s dangerous. They say, ‘Well, you wouldn’t want somebody like that with such a hot head with his fingers on the nuclear codes.’ And yeah, that’s certainly true. That’s not the real danger. The real danger is that ironically Donald Trump could destroy America’s chance to be great again.” During the second Republican presidential debate that same month, the CNN anchor Jake Tapper referred to Jindal’s concern about Trump and the nuclear codes, and asked Carly Fiorina, “Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump’s finger on the nuclear codes?” Fiorina hemmed and hawed, deflected and redirected, doing anything not to say what everyone knew — that Trump with the nuclear codes was a horrible idea. Jeb Bush also cowered when the question was put to him. But Rand Paul was forthright and forceful, saying: “I think really there’s a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried. I’m very concerned about him, having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his visceral response to attack people on their appearance — short, tall, fat, ugly — my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?” During a December 2015 Republican debate, Dana Bash, the CNN anchor, referred to a statement Ted Cruz made on the campaign trail about his actual beliefs about Trump and nuclear weapons, saying, “Senator Cruz, you have not been willing to attack Mr. Trump in public.” She continued, “But you did question his judgment in having control of America’s nuclear arsenal during a private meeting with supporters.” Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign, in a foreign policy speech in June 2016, “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.” In July 2016, Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter for his best-selling memoir “The Art of the Deal,” revealed to The New Yorker, “I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.” He continued, “I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes, there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.” That same month, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia warned at the Democratic National Convention about “giving the nuclear codes to a man who praises Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein.” In August 2016, a Republican representative, Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Hillary Clinton because, as he put it: “I think Trump is a national embarrassment. Is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes?” By the time Clinton had her first debate against Trump, she had sharpened this nuclear attack line, but something about it still felt dull: “A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.” Something about all these warnings, while true, felt of another time, like they were happening during the Cold War, rather than tailored for an election about the culture wars. Still, a Fox News poll conducted a month before the election found that voters overwhelmingly trusted Clinton to do a better job making decisions about using nuclear weapons. But enough Americans looked past these warnings, just as they pushed past so many others, to hand Trump the election. After all, the nuclear question was theoretical and academic, right? No, it wasn’t. In fact, after the election, concern about Trump controlling our nuclear arsenal only congealed. The worry is so real that in January, a Democratic representative, Ted Lieu of California, introduced the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act, which is designed “to prohibit the conduct of a first-use nuclear strike absent a declaration of war by Congress.” In May, The Washington Times quoted Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, as saying, “We do not trust him with our nuclear weapons arsenal” and “We do not want him to use nuclear weapons first in the North Korean standoff — not just there in Korea, but all across the planet.” The article also quotes Markey as saying of Trump, “As his comments become more erratic and inconsistent on the use of nuclear weapons, we think it’s imperative for the United States Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority to have the power to determine whether or not these nuclear weapons are used first against any country.” Trump continues his war of words and measuring of egos with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. While I still find the threat of a nuclear strike remote, it grows less and less remote with every passing day and every insult. Kim Jong-un is irrational and unhinged, but so is Trump. No matter whether I agreed with President Barack Obama’s policies or not, I never once worried that he might ignite a nuclear war. That assurance has now been removed. As my colleague Nicholas Kristof, who recently visited North Korea, said of the possibility of a war between our country and theirs, “War is preventable, but I’m not sure it will be prevented.” This is what Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, meant when he talked to The New York Times last week. The Times reported that Corker charged that Trump was “treating his office like ‘a reality show,’ with reckless threats toward other countries that could set the nation ‘on the path to World War III.’ ” Plenty of people tried to warn us about this moment, but not enough Americans took heed. To them, this was sky-is-falling hyperbole. The use of nuclear weapons was a thing of history and Hollywood. But it is ever so clear that the threat is urgent and real and that the only thing standing between a nuclear strike and us is a set of short fingers that constantly type out Twitter insults. If all this makes you uneasy, good. It should. Also, welcome to the club.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s ‘Imaginary Thinking’,"Letter To the Editor: “ ‘Soon,’ ‘Very Soon,’ ‘Eventually’: A Detailed List of Things Trump Said Would Happen” (Oct. 2) documents a manner of speaking by President Trump that, unfortunately, says a lot about his psychological makeup. When he comes up against issues for which there is no easy solution — that is, most of what a president faces — he kicks the proverbial can down the road, reassuring himself that one day it will all be worked out. This is a kind of imaginary thinking common in childhood that typically gives way to a more realistic view of the world. That our president still thinks this way should be of concern to all of us, regardless of party affiliation. LARRY S.

2017,Opinion | Trump’s ‘Obsession With Obama’,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Top General’s Grief Becomes a Political Talking Point for the President” (news article, Oct. 18): Lacking the grace, skill, empathy, humor, work ethic, knowledge, tact, thick skin and fitness for the job, all of which former President Barack Obama possessed in depth, President Trump displays his envy by lying about Mr. Obama: suggesting that he did not tend to fallen and wounded soldiers when Mr. Obama did so constantly; suggesting that the Iran nuclear deal is terrible and that the Affordable Care Act is a failure — both untrue, and Mr. Trump is unable to explain what is wrong with either. Mr. Trump is the same man who led the “birther” charge against Mr. Obama and accused the former president of wiretapping his office — both charges false. Mr. Trump’s obsession with Mr. Obama seems abnormal. JOHN E. COLBERTARROYO SECO, N.M.",The New York Times
2017,Trying the Feldenkrais Method for Chronic Pain,"Personal Health After two hourlong sessions focused first on body awareness and then on movement retraining at the Feldenkrais Institute of New York, I understood what it meant to experience an incredible lightness of being. Having, temporarily at least, released the muscle tension that aggravates my back and hip pain, I felt like I was walking on air. I had long refrained from writing about this method of countering pain because I thought it was some sort of New Age gobbledygook with no scientific basis. Boy, was I wrong! The Feldenkrais method is one of several increasingly popular movement techniques, similar to the Alexander technique, that attempt to better integrate the connections between mind and body. By becoming aware of how one’s body interacts with its surroundings and learning how to behave in less stressful ways, it becomes possible to relinquish habitual movement patterns that cause or contribute to chronic pain. The method was developed by Moshe Feldenkrais, an Israeli physicist, mechanical engineer and expert in martial arts, after a knee injury threatened to leave him unable to walk. Relying on his expert knowledge of gravity and the mechanics of motion, he developed exercises to help teach the body easier, more efficient ways to move. I went to the institute at the urging of Cathryn Jakobson Ramin, author of the recently published book “Crooked” that details the nature and results of virtually every current approach to treating back pain, a problem that has plagued me on and off (now mostly on) for decades. Having benefited from Feldenkrais lessons herself, Ms. Ramin had good reason to believe they would help me. In her book, she recounts the experience of Courtney King, who first experienced crippling back spasms in her late 20s. Ms. King was taking several dance classes a week and practicing yoga, and she thought the stress of these activities might be causing the pain in her tight, inflexible back. But after a number of Feldenkrais sessions, she told Ms. Ramin, “I realized that the pain had more to do with the way I carried myself every day.” Even after just one session, I understood what she meant. When I make a point of walking upright and fluid, sitting straight, even cooking relaxed and unhurried, I have no pain. The slow, gentle, repetitive movements I practiced in a Feldenkrais group class helped foster an awareness of how I use my body in relation to my environment, and awareness is the first step to changing one’s behavior. One common problem of which I’m often guilty is using small muscles to accomplish tasks meant for large, heavy-duty ones, resulting in undue fatigue and pain. The group class, called Awareness Through Movement, was followed by an individual session called Functional Integration with a therapist that helped to free tight muscles and joints that were limiting my motion and increasing my discomfort. Using gentle manipulation and passive movements, the therapist individualized his approach to my particular needs. The ultimate goal of both sessions is, in effect, to retrain the brain – to establish new neural pathways that result in easy, simple movements that are physiologically effective and comfortable. Although the Feldenkrais method was developed in the mid-20th century, neurophysiologists have since demonstrated the plasticity of the brain, its ability to form new cells, reorganize itself and, in effect, learn new ways to do things. The beauty of Feldenkrais lessons is that they are both relatively low-cost (group classes average $15 to $25, individual sessions $100 to $200) and potentially accessible to nearly everyone. There are more than 7,000 teachers and practitioners working in 18 countries, including large numbers in the United States. You can be any age, strength, fitness level and state of well-being to participate. The exercises are slow, gentle and adjustable to whatever might ail you. Their calming effect counters the stress that results in contracted muscles, tightness and pain. Many Feldenkrais practitioners, like Marek Wyszynski, director of the New York center, start professional life as physical therapists, although many other practitioners begin with no medical background. They then undergo three and a half years of training to become certified in the Feldenkrais method. Mr. Wyszynski explained that he starts by observing how patients are using their skeletons – how they sit, stand and walk in ways that may cause or contribute to their pathology, be it spinal disc disease, arthritis, shoulder pain or damaged knee joints. In accordance with Dr. Feldenkrais’s astute observation, “If you don’t know what you are doing, you can’t do what you want,” patients are then given a clear sensory experience of how their posture and behavior contribute to their pain and physical limitations. For example, some people may use excessive force, clench their teeth, hold their breath or rush, causing undue muscle tension and skeletal stress. Years ago, I realized that my frequent headaches resulted from an unconscious habit of clenching my jaw when I concentrated intently on a task like sewing or cooking. Feldenkrais teachers do not give formulas for a proper way of behaving; rather, they rely on their patients’ ability to self-discover and self-correct. Once aware of their counterproductive habits, students are given the opportunity to experience alternative movements, postures and behaviors and, through practice, create new habits that are less likely to cause pain. Mr. Wyszynski told me that there are more than 1,000 distinct Feldenkrais lessons currently available, most of which involve everyday actions like reaching, getting up from a chair, turning, bending and walking. As a mechanical engineer and physicist, Dr. Feldenkrais understood that the job of the human skeleton was to accommodate the effects of gravity in order to remain upright. And he wanted people to achieve this in the most efficient way possible. Using two tall foam cylinders, one perched on top of the other, Mr. Wyszynski demonstrated a guiding principle of the Feldenkrais method. When the top cylinder was centered on the bottom one, it stood in place without assistance. But when it was off center, perched near the edge of the bottom cylinder, it tipped over. If instead of cylinders these were someone’s skeletal parts that were askew, tightened muscles would have to keep the patient from falling over. As Mr. Wyszynski explained, “Good posture allows the skeleton to hold up and support the body without expending unnecessary energy despite the pull of gravity. However, with poor posture, the muscles are doing part of the job of the bones, and with poor skeletal support, the muscles have to remain contracted to prevent the body from falling.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trying to Breathe in the Bay Area,"Op-Ed Contributor OAKLAND, Calif. — My neighbors are picking lemons from their tree in gas masks. My husband is overnighting us particulate masks to breathe through because Home Depot and all the Ace Hardware stores nearby are sold out, just like they sold out of every single fan in August, during the heat wave. It’s the latest version of California’s new normal: Add masks to your emergency kit, don’t breathe deeply and try to stay inside. When I woke up one morning last week with a nose bleed and a wracking cough, I decided to give in and order that particulate mask, but first I consulted with friends. “Is N95 the same as P95?” Liat asked, as we huddled over my laptop. My nurse friend said to search for N95, but the old bepreparedcalifornia.ca.gov pdf that is circulating uses a “P,” and Keally says the one put out by the pre-Pruitt Environmental Protection Agency is better. Seth sends out more links about smaller-size masks to a group of neighborhood parents because the ones we bought don’t come in kid sizes. It’s been seven days now of some of the Bay Area’s worst ever air quality, and most of the fires north of us in Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties are minimally contained, or not at all. The smog enveloping Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other cities is literal and figurative: There has been little clarity about how best to protect ourselves. The consensus seems to be that we’re not supposed to exercise, that we should refrain from driving as much as possible and that if we do venture outside we should be wearing the kind of heavy-duty face masks that keep out the smallest particulate matter, these gray ashes that are falling from the sky. My friend Iris and I brainstorm about the most airtight public spaces, places like movie theaters or hospitals that can filter air for large numbers of people, so we can gather there. She researches which filters really work for smoke pollution, and texts a group of us to say her living room will have the filter on at all times for anyone who needs to come over. So many of my friends work remotely — writers and freelancers who often sit in the Bay Area breeze all day, squinting into their laptops. But the coffee shops and co-working spaces aren’t airtight, and today my usual ones are mostly empty. I’m writing this from the public library in East Oakland, because my friend Samantha said if you work from home that’s the best place to go right now — most public libraries have central air filtration and are not pulling the smoky air from the outside. Another friend, Jessie, tells me that the library at San Francisco’s Civic Center is unusually packed with hipsters. We are checking two websites nonstop: one for the fire monitoring and one for air quality. The websites keep crashing, though, I think because they weren’t built for this much traffic. But this is the Bay Area, after all — we want the right maps, and we want them fast. “You can’t even zoom in on the air quality map,” I catch myself complaining. There’s a gray light over everything all day long. On the last six evenings, we’ve had what in any other situation you’d call a gorgeous sunset, the bright orange sun a perfect disk framed in gray between the Marin Headlands. But as I step out of my car I look away from it, shielding my face from its apocalyptic light. I wonder if this will become our new way of life, if slowly we’re just going to get used to avoiding the air. My husband reminds me not to turn on the air conditioner or central fan in our house because it will bring in smoke from outside. I press down every window to make sure it’s tight, and cancel a run with my neighbor after work because neither of us wants to even walk the slight uphill climb to the park. People I’ve never thought could relate to this situation write to me on the internet. My friend who used to live in China posts advice on my Facebook wall about how to survive air pollution and when to decide enough is enough, and leave. It can feel that way here right now — some of our best-known tourist destinations burned to ashes, regular avalanches on our highways. A friend notes that we can no longer refer to a “fire season” in California because the inferno of fires just seem to blend one into the next. It’s enough to make anyone start thinking about Armageddon. “Maybe it won’t be livable for much longer here,” Iris says over tea, “maybe we should start planning to move.” “But also,” Ellie says, “where would we go? It’s not like there aren’t disasters happening everywhere.” I walk into a clothing swap one night and a woman there is talking about her aunt who has lost everything: home, clothing, decades of memories. I sit on the couch and nod along. “Yeah,” I say, “it’s awful up there.” “Oh,” she says, tilting her head toward me, “this is actually in Puerto Rico.”",The New York Times
2017,Trying to Follow the Muse While Domestic Life Calls,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE RESURRECTION OF JOAN ASHBYBy Cherise Wolas 534 pp. Flatiron Books. $27.99. There are the demands and joys of creating art … and then there are the demands and joys of being a parent. My artist-mother friends and I struggle to secure — and pay for — reliable child care so that we may do our strange, sacred work. Even then, the morass of domestic duties threatens to ooze under the doors of our studios and offices. For the eponymous heroine of Cherise Wolas’s ambitious, problematic debut novel, “The Resurrection of Joan Ashby,” the struggles with parenthood are more philosophical than practical. When she gets pregnant by accident, her new husband, an ocular surgeon named Martin Manning, is thrilled, even though he swore to her he would respect her wishes to never have children. By this time, Joan is 25 and the author of two best-selling, highly acclaimed story collections: “She did not want motherhood, had no underlying faith in her ability to negotiate the enormity of the obligation, had no interest in the supposed majesty of the experience.” And yet. She considers this crossroads as if she were a character in one of her stories. She imagines a fictional Joan choosing this baby, and she steps into the role. This intimate, introspective scene isn’t the reader’s first glimpse of our heroine. Cleverly, Wolas opens the novel with an essay from a literary magazine about Ashby and her work, providing an overview of an exceptional career, including excerpts from both of Joan’s books. Before we come to know Joan Ashby, the person, we have already met Joan Ashby, the author. This second identity is the one our heroine connects to more keenly — she is the “realest Joan Ashby,” and by the time she is pregnant with her second child, she longs to return to “that place of pure self.” But will she? From the opening essay, the reader knows that nearly three decades have passed since the publication of Ashby’s second story collection. Did marriage and motherhood derail her? And if so, how? Wolas skillfully dramatizes these answers. Her descriptions of Ashby creating and abandoning work capture that lusty feeling of writing well and that sense of desolation and resignation when the product doesn’t match the initial vision. What slows the narrative down are the excerpts from her work. It’s frustrating to read mere portions of a short story or novel, in part because they require we take leave of Joan’s vivid fictional life. Joan Ashby’s writing is a touch amateur; for instance, raindrops are “big as cats and dogs,” and her characters read like fantasies of free spirits more than actual people. It’s hard to believe her fiction would have influenced the literary conversation or made her an international best seller. Joan and Martin hire a full-time nanny, the delightfully named Fancy, a cheery young Canadian with hair “the color of wet sand” who takes over all domestic duties. She not only watches the first child, Daniel, and his brother, Eric, but also cleans the house, cooks the meals and even plants a garden. The problem isn’t that Joan doesn’t have time or the support to write; it’s that her husband, by his bland interest in her work, and her kids, by their presence alone, transgress on her very being. For this reason, Joan decides to start a novel in private, a secret that is at once empowering and dangerous: “She was writing up in her castle, in the tower she had constructed for herself, away from prying eyes and Martin’s need to expose the complicated mechanics of her mind.” Of course, a book written in secret is like Chekhov’s gun, and will have to be read. There is a terrific twist midway through the novel that shifts the focus away from Joan Ashby’s struggles to follow her creative destiny, and toward questions of talent, loyalty and communication within families. Is there room for more than one genius in a household? Can we escape the shadows of our parents? Does a mother need to sacrifice her own success for that of her offspring? All narratives must manage the passage of time, but a novel that covers decades must distill entire years into paragraphs, a challenge for any writer, let alone a debut novelist. Sometimes Wolas’s book reads like a juicy 19th-century tome, the narrative alighting on essential moments and then jumping forward in years, time sweeping over the reader. The flip side is that a few key events in the Manning family feel glossed over. A major crisis with Eric is swiftly summarized, even though it causes Joan to put her secret book aside for seven years. By contrast, we get a long scene of our protagonist on an airplane, complete with shopworn descriptions of overhead bins and snack carts. The scenic disparity would be a quibble were it not for the novel’s final act, which takes place in India. Far from home, Joan is able to avoid the life she accepted but never really wanted, and the novel thus avoids drama by staying in India for a protracted period. She goes alone to Dharamshala to process a familial betrayal and reassert the identity she’s lost. Here, minor characters, many of them Indian, offer her pearls of wisdom and speeches that flatter her ego. When Joan, now called Ashby by her new friends, wonders if she can cut ties with her life in Northern Virginia, she knows “she would miss the grand architectural house, the lap pool in the bucolic glen, the Croatian limestone island in the kitchen.” I cringed. It’s not unforgivable for a successful American writer, married to a famous doctor, to find solace in this foreign country, but I’d expect a character as self-possessed as Joan Ashby to acknowledge her exceptional privilege — and even, perhaps, to question her epiphanies. If she has found succor in this new world, it’s partly because she’s rich enough to turn her back on the conflicts that have so plagued her. For this reader, the ending offered delusions posing as revelations. That I got so worked up about a person who doesn’t exist is a testament to Cherise Wolas’s success in creating a complex and distinct fictional character. Joan Ashby is like no writer I have ever encountered; I’m sure, if she were real, she would be pleased to hear it.",The New York Times
2017,Turbo-Charging His Life After Losing His Mother,"The Neediest Cases Fund Atreyal Ransom has a firm handshake. He stands just 5 foot 9, but his presence is commanding. Although he had spent the afternoon instructing children at a community center in Coney Island, Brooklyn, his collared shirt and slacks remained unwrinkled. He was serious. But when the conversation turned to cars, he talked fast and his demeanor changed. “My dream car, that’s a Subaru BRZ,” Mr. Ransom, 19, said recently, his eyes brightening. “You can do a lot with that car because you can change it to be just the way you want it. Me, I like loud cars. “The first thing I’d do with that car is get it turbo-charged,” he continued. “It’s hard to explain, but turbo-charging your car is like music, like finding your perfect song.” In a mechanics class in high school, he was the only student to rebuild a broken car engine, said to be irreparable. Going beyond the requirements of the project, he souped-up the engine, and not just for the amplified sound. “I have a need for speed,” Mr. Ransom said with a laugh. If he could, he would also one day pair his dream Subaru with a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. A good weekend project, he said, would be to tweak that car to his exact taste. Mr. Ransom has his driver’s license but has never owned a car. His interest in automobiles stems from long drives with his father, whom he has seen more often since his mother’s death in 2011. His mother, Adrienne Williams, never told him she had cancer. She went to the hospital with pains every few days for weeks. Doctors told that her she had vaginal cancer, and that there was little they could do for her. Ms. Williams died one May night, devastating her young son, who thought she had just had the flu. “A big chunk of my life was gone,” Mr. Ransom recalled. “She was my best friend. I lost my best friend and my mom on the same day.” Mr. Ransom and his half brother, Christopher Jones, who is eight years older, were raised by Ms. Williams, a single parent. She lived with her sons just one building away from her own mother’s home in O’Dwyer Gardens, a New York City Housing Authority development in Coney Island. From age 5, after school and during the summers, Mr. Ransom would go to the community center beneath his grandmother’s apartment before his mother returned home from work. Ms. Williams had worked in hospice care and was no stranger to death and suffering. She hoped to spare her sons from that reality by keeping her diagnosis a secret. But her death changed everything, Mr. Ransom said. He stopped going to the community center. He stopped paying attention in school. He got in trouble for talking out of turn and roughhousing in the classroom. He dreaded parent-teacher conferences, which his brother and his grandmother, June Williams, now attended. He repeated the fifth grade. He promised his grandmother and his brother that he would get back on track, and they took turns assisting him with homework. At 14, he entered sixth grade but was still in remedial classes. And as he worked to make progress, he returned to the community center, where he received help on his schoolwork. He also began giving back and has since completed over 3,000 hours of service — more than any other volunteer at the center, Nain Merino, the program director, said. In July 2016, Brooklyn Community Services, one of eight beneficiary organizations of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, took over programming at the center. “And when I opened up, he was the first one at the door,” Ms. Merino said. “At first I thought he was part of my staff. He gave me a rundown of the place.” Now, Mr. Ransom volunteers there with children ages 5 to 12, helping them with homework and assisting with an imaginary playground where children can create their own safe recreational spaces. (The center does not have sufficient room for a traditional playground.) Last year, he was elected president of the center’s Youth Council, ran a Thanksgiving potluck and delivered holiday presents to the children. Seeking to graduate on time, Mr. Ransom in 2016 enrolled at Liberation Diploma Plus High School, a transfer school in Brooklyn intended to help students struggling in a traditional academic setting. There, he doubled up on schoolwork and graduated as valedictorian of his class in June. This semester he started at Borough of Manhattan Community College, where he received a scholarship. But money was tight, and in September, Brooklyn Community Services provided Mr. Ransom with $500 in gift cards from Neediest Cases funds to buy school books, a backpack and new clothes and shoes. Mr. Ransom still lives with his brother in the apartment they once shared with their mother. He is looking for a job, ideally one that would allow him to combine his experience working with children and his interest in mechanics, to better help with their rent. After graduating, he hopes to attend Universal Technical Institute to specialize in automotive engineering. Eventually, Mr. Ransom would like to move to San Diego and set up a one-stop shop to fix cellphones, cars and more. He is still finessing the name, but the working title is Wonder Industries. “2026, that’s my year to leave,” he said. “I can see myself living in California. Just me and my two dream cars. Once I’m there, I’ll just drive.”",The New York Times
2017,Turkey Convicts Wall Street Journal Reporter in Absentia,"A Turkish court convicted a longtime Wall Street Journal reporter in absentia on terrorism charges and sentenced her to two years and one month in prison. The conviction of the reporter, Ayla Albayrak, was the latest action in a crackdown against the press in Turkey, which the Committee to Protect Journalists ranked last year as the world’s leading jailer of news media members. Ms. Albayrak, a dual citizen of Turkey and Finland, was accused of violating Article 7/2 of Turkey’s Antiterror Law with her article headlined “Urban Warfare Escalates in Turkey’s Kurdish-Majority Southeast” in August 2015. The article described clashes between Turkish security forces and Kurdish separatists in Silopi, a city near the borders of Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Militants linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party had set up checkpoints and declared themselves in control of cities across southeastern Turkey, according to the article. The Wall Street Journal’s editor in chief, Gerard Baker, and its chief executive officer and publisher, William Lewis, condemned the ruling. “This was an unfounded criminal charge and wildly inappropriate conviction that wrongly singled out a balanced Wall Street Journal report,” Mr. Baker said in a statement. “The sole purpose of the article was to provide objective and independent reporting on events in Turkey, and it succeeded.” The newspaper, published by Dow Jones & Company, a division of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., said that an appeal was underway. “The notion that our reporter’s commendable and insightful work led to a criminal prosecution that has resulted in this wrongful conviction is intolerable,” Mr. Lewis said. “We have stood by Ms. Albayrak’s side for nearly two years as we have robustly pursued all available options to defend this baseless prosecution, and we will continue to stand with her as we seek to overturn this conviction.” The ruling was handed down during the state of emergency put into effect by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after a coup attempt in July 2016. A crackdown has led to the arrests of more than 50,000 people, including dozens of foreign citizens and 11 Americans. In its global census last December, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that Turkey was keeping 81 members of the media behind bars. “We call on Turkish authorities not to contest Ayla Albayrak’s appeal and to drop all charges against her,” said Nina Ognianova, the committee’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator. “Dozens of journalists are imprisoned for their work in Turkey and this conviction is a signal that conditions for the press are continuing to deteriorate. Rather than dispensing justice, Turkey’s judicial system has become an instrument of persecution.” The jailing of journalists working abroad for Western news organizations is rare. In Turkey, two British reporters working for Vice were held several days before they were released, but their Iraqi guide remained behind bars for months, said Courtney Radsch, an advocacy director at the Committee to Protect Journalists. In its statement, The Journal said that websites unaffiliated with The Journal or Ms. Albayrak had published reports in Turkish that had selectively quoted and distorted the article. As a result, The Journal said, Turkey had accused her of engaging in terrorist propaganda. “Given the current climate in Turkey, this appalling decision shouldn’t have come as a surprise to me, but it did,” Ms. Albayrak said in a statement. Ms. Albayrak has reported out of The Journal’s Istanbul bureau since 2010 but was in New York at the time of the trial. “The decision shows the extent to which the authorities did not want the operations that were going on in Turkey’s southeast to be reported on. It also shows yet again that the international media is not immune to the ongoing press crackdown in Turkey.”",The New York Times
2017,Turkey Sentences 40 to Life in Coup Attempt Against Erdogan,"ISTANBUL, Turkey — A court in southwestern Turkey handed down life sentences on Wednesday to 40 men, including senior military officers, for trying to assassinate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It was the first high-profile verdict against those accused of plotting to overthrow him in a failed coup attempt last year. The defendants, who included senior military officers and men from Turkish special forces and combat search-and-rescue units, were accused of mounting a helicopter raid on a luxury hotel in the resort town of Marmaris, where Mr. Erdogan was vacationing with his family. The trial is one of over 40 mass proceedings being conducted around the country against people suspected of participating in the coup attempt on July 15, 2016. The plotters used helicopters, tanks and air force jets to bomb institutions, including the Parliament. Two hundred and forty-nine people were killed in the bloody effort to seize power. The attempt failed when Mr. Erdogan evaded capture and rallied supporters onto the streets to face down the coup. Loyal military officers also resisted. In the largest mass trials, several hundred military and air force officers stand accused of sending tanks to seize bridges and bases, and of ordering them to open fire on protesters and military jets to bomb targets. Also charged is the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of orchestrating the coup attempt from his self-imposed exile in the United States. A former political ally of Mr. Erdogan’s, Mr. Gulen fell out with the president in 2013 over accusations of corruption. Since the coup attempt, thousands of his followers have been imprisoned and Turkey has demanded his extradition from Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen was among those indicted in the Marmaris case, but no verdict was reached on the charges against him or two others also being tried in absentia. The judge announced that their trial will continue, news agencies reported. The Marmaris case is of personal interest to Mr. Erdogan. It is the only one in which he has formally applied to be considered an interested party. Two police officers were killed in the attack at the resort. Mr. Erdogan has said he received a warning about the coup attempt and left the hotel. He arrived by plane in his home city of Istanbul around the same time the rogue commandos arrived at the Marmaris hotel. Among those sentenced on Wednesday were Brig. Gen. Gokhan Sonmezates, who was accused of planning the Marmaris attack; Maj. Sukru Seymen of the Special Forces, who led it; and Petty Officer Zekeriya Kuzu, who was found hiding in a cave days after the coup attempt. All were given aggravated life sentences, the toughest penalty under Turkish criminal law. The death penalty was abolished in 2002 under judicial reforms made by Turkey while negotiating for entry to the European Union, but supporters of Mr. Erdogan and relatives of those who died in the coup attempt have called for it to be reinstated to punish those responsible. In the Marmaris case, 37 of the 46 defendants were special forces commandos. One officer was acquitted, 40 received life sentences, and two others received lesser sentences: A former military aide to Mr. Erdogan received a sentence of 18 years, and another officer 15 years. During the trial, which took place in the town of Mugla, some defendants admitted to taking part in the coup attempt but denied trying to assassinate the president. Major Seymen, the commander of the attack, said in testimony on the first day of the trial that the aim was to detain Mr. Erdogan. “I did participate in a coup, but not an assassination attempt,” he said, according to Turkish press reports. “General Sonmezates gave me the order. The order was to capture the president alive.” The major expressed his regret that the two police officers were killed in the clash that night. Some defendants complained that the trial was unfair, and said they were victims of a power struggle. “Words don’t mean anything here, as we didn’t have the chance to a fair trial,” Reuters reported one defendant, Gokhan Sen, saying. “We are just the grass that elephants trampled on during their fight.”",The New York Times
2017,Turkish Court Frees Human Rights Workers in Surprising Move,"ISTANBUL — An Istanbul court on Wednesday ordered the release of a group of leading Turkish human rights campaigners and two foreign co-workers — a German and a Swede — in a surprise softening in Turkey’s yearlong prosecutions after a 2016 coup attempt. The decision, which came just before midnight, was an interim ruling, and the case against the 11 human rights workers will continue. But eight of the accused who were still being held in prison, including the two foreign citizens, were ordered released by the judge. Two of the Turkish citizens will remain under a travel ban, preventing them from traveling abroad. When 10 of the human rights leaders were detained by the police in July as they were attending a workshop at a resort hotel on Buyukada, one of the Princes’ Islands, near Istanbul, Turkey’s nongovernmental and civil society organizations were shaken. The charges against the workers — that they were aiding a terrorist organization — were similar to those being used to detain tens of thousands of Turkish citizens since the failed coup. Fethullah Gulen, an Islamist cleric living in the United States, has been blamed for masterminding the coup attempt, but thousands of others, including political opponents and critics of the government, have been imprisoned in the widespread crackdown. The human rights workers included several senior Turkish representatives of Amnesty International, two foreign consultants, a prominent human rights lawyer and a project specialist for the United Nations World Food Program. The chairman of Amnesty International Turkey, Taner Kilic, was later included in the indictment. In a one-day hearing that lasted late into the night, some of the Turkish citizens were charged with having links to followers of Mr. Gulen, or people who used an encrypted application on their cellphone that prosecutors say was employed by the coup plotters. In a sign of the government’s suspicion of nongovernmental organizations, the indictment charged the detainees with organizing meetings and activities to generate a social movement like the protests that took place in Taksim Square in Istanbul in 2013. In addition, the foreign consultants were accused of giving training sessions on how to conceal data from the police and the authorities. The defendants disputed the charges and pleaded not guilty. Some of them claimed that the evidence was fabricated or just wrong. Most of them refused the statutory offer to repent of their actions in order to receive a more lenient sentence. The two foreigners — Peter Steudtner, 46, a German, and Ali Garawi, 50, a Swede who also has American citizenship — were independent consultants conducting training in stress relief and data security for the small group of human rights campaigners. Mr. Steudtner’s detention ignited a diplomatic dispute between Germany and Turkey. The Germans accused the Turks of taking hostages to pressure Germany to hand over several wanted Turkish citizens. Germany announced a reorientation of its policy toward Turkey, calling for a slowdown of talks for Turkey’s accession to the European Union and the suspension of financial programs. It also cautioned Germans about traveling to Turkey and warned investors against doing business there. Mr. Steudtner denied all charges. “I have always taken a nonviolent approach” and have worked “within a legal framework,” he said at the hearing, describing his career of 20 years in promoting peace and human rights in developing countries. “I never worked with a terrorist organization; it is completely against my personal convictions.” He said computer files that were listed in the indictment as evidence appeared to have been fabricated, and one document contained nothing more than simple instructions on how to transfer computer files from a phone to a storage card. Mr. Garawi spoke emotionally of his bewilderment at the indictment and the toll that three months of imprisonment had taken on his health. A refugee who fled Iran after his father was killed, Mr. Garawi said he had spent 20 years working in nonprofit organizations to help others. “I have devoted my life to alleviating the effects of war because of the trauma I went through as a young child,” he said, “only to come here and experience extreme pain for the last three and a half months.”",The New York Times
2017,Turkish President Erdogan Blames U.S. Ambassador for Visa Row,"ISTANBUL — Turkish officials assailed the United States on Tuesday for its decision to suspend visas for Turkish citizens, defending their right to detain American Embassy employees they accused of spying and blaming the American ambassador for the diplomatic dispute. “We did not start this problem,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said at a news briefing during a visit to Serbia. “The problem is the United States itself.” Mr. Erdogan criticized the American ambassador, John R. Bass, for damaging United States-Turkish relations and said he should have resigned or been recalled after making such a unilateral decision. He said Turkish officials would not accept farewell visits from the ambassador, who was already scheduled to leave Turkey within days to become the ambassador to Afghanistan. “We do not see him as the U.S. representative in Turkey,” Mr. Erdogan said. Turkey has not withdrawn his diplomatic credentials, however. The State Department defended Mr. Bass on Tuesday, and said the decision to suspend visa services in Turkey had been cleared at the highest levels of the United States government, including the State Department and the White House. “Ambassador Bass has our full backing, not only here at the State Department but also at the White House as well,” said Heather Nauert, the department spokeswoman. The dispute began on Sunday after a Turkish employee of the United States Consulate in Istanbul was arrested and accused of having links to Fethullah Gulen, the Islamist cleric accused by the Turkish government of orchestrating a failed coup last year. The consulate employee was the second to be detained this year. A third is being sought, and the police have questioned his family members, according to Turkish news reports. The American Embassy dismissed the charges as baseless, and in response temporarily stopped issuing visas to Turkish citizens to travel to the United States while it assessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of American facilities and personnel. Within hours, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced similar measures in the United States, adding that the suspension included electronic visas and visas bought at the border, the way most tourists and other short-term visitors enter the country. On Tuesday, Turkey seemed to have suspended its electronic visa service for Americans. But officials said by early afternoon that no Americans had been turned back since none had arrived without visas. The Turkish government has been conducting a widespread crackdown under a state of emergency since the coup attempt in July 2016, arresting more than 50,000 people and suspending 150,000 for alleged links to the Gulen movement. It has also insisted on the need for wide-ranging investigations and purges to remove coup plotters and Gulen supporters from government institutions. Military officers, politicians, journalists, academics and government workers have been caught up in the broad sweep, as well as several dozen foreign citizens, including 11 Americans. Western officials have accused Mr. Erdogan of detaining foreign citizens as hostages or bargaining chips in order to secure the extradition of Mr. Gulen, who has been in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since the early 1990s. Political analysts say Mr. Erdogan is also concerned about court cases in the United States against 15 of his bodyguards, who are accused of attacking protesters in Washington in May, and a group, including a former cabinet minister, charged with conspiring to break Iranian sanctions. Adding to the tensions, a Turkish court on Tuesday sentenced a reporter for The Wall Street Journal to more than two years in prison over an article she wrote about the Kurds, the newspaper said. The court deemed the article to be terrorist propaganda in support of a banned Kurdish separatist organization. The conviction of the reporter, Ayla Albayrak, who holds dual Turkish-Finnish citizenship and is currently in New York, “highlights the increasing targeting of journalists in Turkey,” the newspaper reported. “This ruling against a professional and respected journalist is an affront to all who are committed to furthering a free and robust press,” said William Lewis, the chief executive of Dow Jones, the newspaper’s publisher. “We call on those who share this commitment to make their voices heard.” Mr. Erdogan has used the attempted coup to rally political support and stir nationalist sentiment. Many of his supporters openly voice the suspicion that the United States had a hand in the plot and sought his downfall. Mr. Erdogan said on Tuesday that Gulen followers had infiltrated the American Consulate in Istanbul, and he questioned why the United States had tolerated them. “How did these agents infiltrate into the American Consulate?” he asked. “If these agents did not infiltrate the American Consulate, then who put them there? We need to focus on them. No state would allow such agents to threaten it from the inside.” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim set an anti-American tone in comments to party members during a weekly meeting in Ankara. Regarding the legal cases against the United States Consulate employees, he said: “So what? Is it a privilege to be in the U.S. mission? Should we get permission from those gentlemen?” The United States authorities had never asked for Turkey’s permission when they detained an officer of a Turkish state-owned bank, Mr. Yildirim said. He was referring to the arrest in New York of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, the deputy general manager of International Banking at Halkbank, who is among those charged with conspiring to break sanctions on Iran. Mr. Yildirim called for the diplomatic dispute to be resolved swiftly, through dialogue, but he also seemed to be rubbing salt in the wounds of the relationship. He told party members that around 80 percent of Turkish people do not like the United States. It had failed to cooperate with Turkey in the aftermath of the coup attempt and continued to support Kurdish fighters in Syria against Turkey’s request, he added. A survey conducted recently by the Pew Research Group found that 72 percent of Turkish citizens felt that American power and influence were a major threat to their country, an increase of 28 percentage points since 2013. The American suspension of all nonimmigrant visas could affect over 100,000 Turkish citizens who travel to the United States annually, but Turkey is likely to suffer more: Roughly half a million Americans, business travelers and tourists, visit Turkey annually. But Turkey seems to have dialed back on its initial announcements that all visas would be suspended. Customs and Trade Minister Bulent Tufenkci said that no American without a visa would be allowed to enter the country, adding that none had tried so far. The airport police confirmed that no Americans had been turned back, since none had tried to arrive without visas. Trade would not immediately be damaged since a lot of commerce was conducted electronically these days, Mr. Tufenkci said. “The world is getting smaller now,” he said. “Everything is not connected to a visa.”",The New York Times
2017,"Turning Tables in Magnitsky Case, Russia Accuses a Nemesis of Murder","MOSCOW — The case of Sergei L. Magnitsky, the Russian tax lawyer who was imprisoned in 2008 on false charges and died in jail, began as a tragedy. But now, after years of sanctions, countersanctions, bitter feuds and one noteworthy meeting in Trump Tower, the case seems to be entering the realm of farce. Mr. Magnitsky, who worked for William F. Browder, a hedge fund manager who was once the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia, was jailed on tax evasion charges while unraveling a $230 million government tax “refund” that Russian officials had fraudulently granted themselves. He died in prison after being beaten and denied medical care, earning the Kremlin widespread condemnation. Mr. Browder, who was living in London at the time, began lobbying Western governments to punish those responsible for Mr. Magnitsky’s death, an effort that bore fruit when the United States, Estonia and most recently, Canada, imposed sanctions on Russians involved in Mr. Magnitsky’s death. That campaign touched off a nasty confrontation with the Kremlin, and the two sides have been trying ever since to undermine the credibility of the other. Recently, however, Russian prosecutors have taken that effort to a remarkable new level, claiming that Mr. Magnitsky was actually murdered by Mr. Browder. A powerful law enforcement organization, the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor General’s Office, is investigating Mr. Magnitsky’s death as a murder, presenting as evidence what it says are intercepted communications from Western intelligence agencies. The theory was first floated in a documentary broadcast on Russian state television last year, but widely brushed off as crude propaganda. It seemed aimed, as with many Russian disinformation campaigns, at muddying the waters around the issue without necessarily claiming to be credible. It seems the prosecutors have been assembling the case since last year, but their activities came to light just this month when a lawyer representing Mr. Magnitsky’s family gained access to the court docket containing the information presented as evidence by the prosecutors. “This is going on because my role in their troubles just seems to be escalating,” Mr. Browder said in a telephone interview, alluding to the sanctions. A Russian court has already convicted Mr. Browder in absentia of fraud in a case he called retaliation for his lobbying against the government of President Vladimir V. Putin. “Basically, I’m their worst nightmare,” Mr. Browder said. “And their previous attempts to rein me in and get me back to Russia haven’t worked. It went from tax evasion, to more tax evasion, to fraud and libel, and now it is working its way up to murder.” The case gained new prominence this summer after it emerged that a lawyer supporting the Russian government’s position had met during last year’s presidential election with the senior leadership of the Trump campaign, including the chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and Mr. Trump’s son and son-in-law. The new accusation is made all the more sinister for its absurd and at times cartoonish details. Prosecutors contend that Mr. Browder had colluded with an agent of Britain’s foreign intelligence agency, MI6, “to cause the death of S. L. Magnitsky,” by persuading Russian prison doctors to withhold care. The motive, according to what prosecutors said were intelligence intercepts, was to start a scandal, or “a significant news trigger to discredit the Russian Federation in the eyes of the international community.” While they were about it, the prosecutors used the so-called intercepts, written in grammatically flawed English, to wrap into the plot two other Kremlin nemeses — Grigory A. Yavlinsky and Aleksei A. Navalny, prominent Russian opposition politicians. The supposed scheme was called Operation Quake. The prosecutors say that Mr. Browder was assigned the code name Agent Solomon by Western intelligence, while Mr. Navalny was called Agent Freedom. Referring to Agent Solomon, one filing recounts how he “was offered by proxies in the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service to arrange the termination of any medical services for Magnitsky.” The measure that Mr. Browder campaigned for in the United States passed in 2012 as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and Accountability Act. It denied visas and blocked access to the American financial system for Russians deemed to have committed human rights abuses and avoided punishment at home, including those involved in the Magnitsky tax fraud case. Mr. Putin, perceiving an intrusion into his country’s affairs, campaigned hard against the measure. When it passed, he retaliated by ending American adoptions of Russian children. The law became a prototype for the blacklisting of prominent Russians later applied in new sanctions laws during the Ukraine crisis.",The New York Times
2017,Twin Mosque Attacks Kill Scores in One of Afghanistan’s Deadliest Weeks,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Just like any other day, Zareen Gul, 60, held the hand of her grandson, Ali Seyar Nazari, 10, and left home to attend the early evening prayer in their neighborhood mosque in the west of Kabul. This time, however, they did not return home. Their family found their remains, barely identifiable from the clothes they wore, at a hospital after an Islamic State suicide bomber targeted the prayer. Ms. Gul and young Seyar became the latest victims of what has been one of Afghanistan’s deadliest weeks. The death toll from twin attacks on mosques late on Friday, just hours apart, was raised on Saturday to at least 67 people killed and dozens wounded. As many as 88 may have died in the two attacks. More than 200 people, both civilians and security personnel, have been killed this week in Afghanistan in six attacks. A precise casualty total is hard to get, as varying levels of violence rage in more than half the country’s provinces. “This week alone, hundreds of Afghan civilians going about their daily lives, including practicing their religious faith, have fallen victims to brutal acts of violence,” António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said in a statement. “The cycle of violence must end and dialogue commence.” Late Saturday afternoon, another suicide bombing was carried out in Kabul, targeting a minibus carrying students from the city’s military academy. “Fourteen officers were killed. We don’t have information on the number of wounded,” said Gen. Mohammad Radmanish, a spokesman for the Afghan defense ministry. The country’s security forces have suffered heavy casualties this week, with at least 89 killed in three Taliban attacks nationwide. Ms. Gul and Seyar were among the 58 killed when a suicide bomber detonated explosives in the Imam Zaman Shiite mosque in the west of Kabul. The other mosque attack happened in Dolaina district, in the western province of Ghor, and the exact casualty toll was contested. Two senior security officials put the death toll at 21, while the district’s governor told local Afghan media that 30 people had been killed. However, Bismillah Khan, the head of criminal investigations at the district’s police force, insisted only 9 people had died. While no group claimed responsibility for the Ghor attack, the Islamic State, in a statement, said that one of its fighters in what it called Khorasan Province, an ancient name for the region that includes Afghanistan, had detonated an explosive vest inside the mosque in Western Kabul. “There were about 300 worshipers inside the mosque, with women on one side,” said Mohammed Ibrahim, a neighborhood leader who was surveying the destruction on Saturday. The pulpit, the walls, as well as much of the carpet in the front of the hall was covered in blood. “The figure I got from the security forces today is that 58 people are killed and 64 wounded in last night’s suicide attack,” Mr. Ibrahim said. “Among those killed were 6 children underage 12 and four women.” Sayed Nazer, a witness, said he was in front of the mosque arriving for prayer when the explosion knocked him to the ground. “When I stood up, some people were rushing inside the mosque and some running outside. I saw three police pickup trucks full of bodies taken away, before even ambulances arrived.” The number of attacks this year against the places of worship of the Shiite minority have alarmed many Afghans. The United Nations, before Friday’s attack, said at least 84 Shiites have been killed and nearly 200 injured in attacks on mosques this year. While the Islamic State has claimed most of the attacks targeting Shiites in Afghanistan, both Western and Afghan officials still have doubts about the group’s role in Afghanistan. They question whether there is coordination with Iraq and Syria, or if the group claiming affiliation with the Islamic State overlaps with some of the more extreme elements of the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban. In August, Islamic State suicide bombers stormed a mosque in north Kabul during Friday prayers, leaving at least 40 worshipers dead. Weeks earlier, an attack on another mosque in the western city of Herat killed scores. After the explosion at Imam Zaman mosque, emotions ran high outside. Many people had escaped the mosque in Kabul barefoot, and some protested what they saw as the government’s perceived inability to protect the country’s Shiites, chanting, “Death to Ashraf Ghani,” Afghanistan’s president. On Saturday, relatives prepared for burial the bodies of Ms. Gul and Seyar at another mosque nearby. The two were to be buried in their family cemetery in the west of the city this afternoon. “Seyar was a smart kid, and he would often ask: ‘Why is there a war going on, what are they fighting for?’ ” Khalilullah Amini, a member of the family, said. “He went to pray, and this is what happened,” his distraught uncle, Asadullah Nazari, said. “He wanted to become an engineer in the future. His books, his pens, his bag is left at home.”",The New York Times
2017,Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising,"Twitter announced on Thursday that it would ban RT and Sputnik, the two Kremlin-backed international news outlets, from advertising on its platform, intensifying the battle over Russian propaganda on social media and prompting an immediate threat of retaliation from the Russian Foreign Ministry. The decision marks one of the most aggressive moves by an American social media company against the outlets, which United States intelligence officials have linked to a wide-ranging Kremlin effort, both covert and overt, to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Twitter’s ban comes as United States authorities are pressuring RT, formerly known as Russia Today, to register as a foreign agent under a World War II-era law intended to curtail Nazi propaganda. “We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said in a blog post announcing the ban. The ban will not apply to any other advertisers, Twitter said, and RT and Sputnik will be allowed to retain their own Twitter accounts and followers. RT’s editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, called Twitter’s decision “highly regrettable” and cast it as part of a punitive campaign by the United States government against her own country. Earlier on Thursday, Ms. Simonyan taunted Twitter on its own platform, tweeting that the company had pitched RT on a large advertising campaign for the 2016 election that RT had declined. The Russian government, which in recent days has warned that it will respond in kind to American pressure on RT, responded even more forcefully. In a statement posted on Facebook, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, called Twitter’s decision “yet another aggressive step” and blamed the influence of American intelligence officials. “Naturally, a response will follow,” Ms. Zakharova said. Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, is now at the center of congressional investigations into the Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human “trolls” and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government. But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively. Now the Silicon Valley companies — long used to practically unchallenged clout in Washington — face rising calls for tighter regulation from both conservatives and liberals and growing scrutiny of their sheer market dominance. Twitter’s general counsel will testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, alongside executives from Facebook and Google. Last month, Facebook said it would adopt new rules to bring greater transparency to advertising on its platform. Earlier this week, Twitter said it would add new labels to political ads on the service, identifying the ads’ sponsors. But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitter’s lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising. Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign. Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities’ use of the platform to influence American politics praised the company’s decision on Thursday — but cautioned that it would not be enough. “I appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time,” said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitter’s most vocal critics on Capitol Hill. “What I hope is we’ll see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.” Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and John McCain of Arizona, who introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this month that would force Facebook, Google and other technology companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, said the action only underscored the need for a new, across-the-board standard for social media companies to follow when it comes to political advertising. “Twitter’s announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets — RT and Sputnik — from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute” for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement. Twitter, with 328 million monthly active users, is far smaller than Facebook, and has struggled more to find growth and financial stability. In September, the company’s vice president for policy, Colin Crowell, met with staff from House and Senate intelligence committees and shared copies of advertisements run on Twitter by RT’s three principal Twitter accounts. In a public statement, Twitter said that RT had purchased about $274,100 in advertising aimed at United States markets in 2016, promoting close to 2,000 Tweets. On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011. The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda. Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitter’s decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform. Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human “trolls” on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news. “I think it’s only a drop in the bucket,” said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “What’s far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputnik’s ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesn’t need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.” Moreover, Twitter’s decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter — and rival social media companies — treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms. Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda. China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV. A Twitter spokeswoman said the company’s decision on RT and Sputnik was informed by specific findings of the United States intelligence community, made public in January, and would not affect other government-sponsored outlets. “This is not about being a state-sponsored news organization,” the spokeswoman said in a statement. “It’s about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.”",The New York Times
2017,Twitter Plans to Open Ad Data to Users,"WASHINGTON — Twitter said on Tuesday that it would bring more transparency to advertisements on its site, including political ads, in the latest response by a technology company to criticism about its role in spreading foreign propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The company said that under its new rules, users would be able to see who had created an ad, how long an ad had been running and how the ad was targeted toward a specific user. Political ads for a candidate or party would carry a special label to make them stand out. Twitter said it would disclose who had paid for the election advertisement and allow users to find information about the buyer, including ad spending history and ad targeting practices. In a blog post outlining its plans, Twitter said it would also create stricter requirements for who could purchase political ads. The company said it would also limit targeting options and create stronger penalties for violators. Twitter said it would put some of these changes in place in the coming weeks, starting in the United States and then expanding globally. The announcement is part of a major shift in the industry to lift the veil over how its secretive advertising businesses — its cash centers — work, as lawmakers put more pressure on social media companies about the role their sites played in Russia’s attempt to influence the election. Twitter, Facebook and Google are scheduled to appear for hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Nov. 1. Lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration about Twitter. In late September, he said Twitter’s response was “inadequate” when it was asked to provide evidence of Russian-linked advertising and accounts that spread misinformation or were used to favor a presidential candidate. At the time, Twitter said it had discovered about 200 accounts linked to Russian efforts to influence the election. But that figure was significantly less than the number uncovered a month earlier by researchers from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the public policy research group in Washington. The researchers tracked 600 Twitter accounts — both human and suspected automated “bots” — that they linked to Russian attempts to influence the election. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said that the company’s announcement did not go far enough and that online companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google needed rules that the government could enforce. Last week, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a bill that would require digital platforms to report who bought political ads on their sites in the same way that TV broadcast stations must maintain databases with those disclosures. The bill was a response to concern that fake accounts linked to Russia on Facebook and other sites were able to fly past monitors on the sites and easily buy thousands of ads promoting racial and other hot-button issues to sow chaos before the election and to influence the result. “I welcome this transparency,” Ms. Klobuchar said, “but we need a law in place for two major reasons: Not every company will do this, and you need rules for the road.” She added that the companies should not be left to police themselves. The announcement from Twitter followed a public relations blitz this month by Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to announce similar voluntary efforts to tighten standards for ad buyers. Lawmakers are still skeptical, saying there are many unanswered questions about whether the social media sites can prevent the mistakes of the 2016 election on their own. The changes also raise new issues for politicians. For one, advertising agencies often consider their digital strategy part of their “secret sauce” when trying to sell their services to politicians and campaign strategists. Shining a light on the types of ads, the amount spent on them and how often they change could give valuable information to competing candidates. It is also unclear whether Twitter will be able to keep up with campaigns’ ever-changing digital targeting, budgets and goals, and the company did not mention how it plans to tackle large-scale misinformation spread by bots. Many of those automated accounts, along with Twitter users with suspected ties to the Russian government, bombarded the platform without buying advertising. Researchers at the cybersecurity firm FireEye discovered that hundreds or thousands of fake accounts regularly sent out messages criticizing Hillary Clinton — sometimes with identical tweets dispatched seconds apart. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said transparency in advertising alone “is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages.” Twitter said it would try to tighten standards for issues-based ads that wouldn’t fall under its new electioneering rules, such as an environmental group’s push for clean-air policies or an energy company’s promotion of environmental deregulation. But the company admitted that the industry had not agreed on definitions for issues ads. “We will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policymakers and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above,” Twitter said in its blog post.",The New York Times
2017,Twitter Says It Overstated Monthly-User Figures for 3 Years,"Twitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting. The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent. The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitter’s reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russia’s efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide. Initially at least, investors did not appear particularly troubled by news of the inflated user figures. Twitter shares were up 10 percent in premarket trading on Thursday. The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used Digits, a software-development program. Digits is part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Google’s parent company, this year. Digits allowed third-party applications to send authentication messages through Twitter’s systems and did not reflect activity on the Twitter platform, the company said. As a result, the company lowered the number of monthly active users by two million for the first and second quarters of this year and by one million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Twitter said its data-retention policies made it unable to reconcile the figures for periods before last year’s fourth quarter. “Our estimates suggest the prior period adjustments are smaller than those in the fourth quarter of 2016,” the company said. Twitter said that — in addition to the uptick in daily active users — it had experienced a 4 percent increase in monthly active users from the same period last year, to 330 million. The company had 326 million monthly active users in the second quarter. Twitter reported a net loss of $21.1 million for the quarter, compared with a $102.9 million loss for the same period last year. The company’s revenue declined 4 percent, to $590 million.",The New York Times
2017,Twitter Users Split on Boycott Over Platform’s Move Against Rose McGowan,"Activists, celebrities and journalists joined a boycott of Twitter on Friday to protest the social media platform’s locking of the account of the actress Rose McGowan, a fierce critic of the film producer Harvey Weinstein over his alleged sexual harassment and assaults of women. The boycott began at midnight Thursday in New York and was to last all day. Many of those taking part signified their participation with the hashtag #WomenBoycottTwitter. Heidi Moore, an editor, was among the first to popularize the campaign, writing on Twitter, “Friday October 13th seems a good boycott day.” The call resonated widely. Twitter users of all stripes rallied in support of Ms. McGowan’s crusade against Mr. Weinstein and those she has cast as his enablers, or as a way of highlighting the wider issue of women being abused online at what is an especially fraught time for Twitter. Not everyone felt it was an appropriate form of protest, with some people offering particularly pointed criticism. The director Ava DuVernay, for one, noted that minority women had not received similar support when they were subjected to abuse on Twitter. “Calling white women allies to recognize conflict of #WomenBoycottTwitter for women of color who haven’t received support on similar issues,” wrote Ms. DuVernay, the director of “Selma,” who has criticized Hollywood for its lack of inclusivity. Ms. McGowan said Wednesday that Twitter had locked her account over what the company said were violations of its terms of service. Twitter did not initially explain its decision, but said later that it had temporarily frozen Ms. McGowan’s account because one of her messages had included a personal phone number in violation of its rules. By Thursday, the tweet in question had been removed and Ms. McGowan’s account had been unlocked. Ms. McGowan subsequently tagged Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, in a Twitter post in which she said she had repeatedly told the head of Amazon’s movie studio that “HW raped me.” Among the famous names joining the boycott were Alyssa Milano, Ms. McGowan’s co-star in the TV series “Charmed”; the model Chrissy Teigen; the actors John Cusack, Debra Messing, Anna Paquin and Mark Ruffalo; and the writer Cheryl Strayed. Plenty of those participating in the protest came from outside the celebrity ranks. “I love this platform, but it’s time to do better. See you all in 24 hours,” wrote Brianna Wu, a congressional candidate in Massachusetts. For those who chose not to take part, there was a recurring theme: that keeping quiet was the wrong way to protest. “I understand the idea behind #WomenBoycottTwitter but I don’t personally agree that silence is the right protest to being silenced,” wrote one user, @kateleth. Another user, Suzy Tobin, wrote that she would not be joining in because, as a victim of sexual assault, she wanted her voice to be heard. “Because it happens too much & its frightening to speak up. But we have to start talking about it,” she added. “Not joining in on #WomenBoycottTwitter because I don’t see the point in silent protest. I believe in loud annoyance,” wrote another, @AineCarson1. Contacted for comment on Friday, a Twitter press representative cited the company’s statement about why it had locked Ms. McGowan’s account. Ms. McGowan, who reached a $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997, has been vocal in her support of other women who have come forward to accuse the producer of sexual abuse. On Tuesday, responding to the actor Ben Affleck’s comments about the accusations against Mr. Weinstein, Ms. McGowan called Mr. Affleck a liar and said he had known about the producer’s actions. She also criticized other Hollywood figures for their silence on the matter, writing in one Twitter post, “You all knew.” Twitter has struggled in the past to find a balance in moderating content on it platform. It has tried to adhere to principles of free speech, but its efforts have sometimes been undermined by pseudonymous trolls directing abuse at other users. The company is under increasing scrutiny as lawmakers investigate how it was used as part of Russia’s effort to interfere in the presidential election last year. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that a briefing provided by the company to congressional investigators “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is.” Twitter’s problems with unsavory content have also put off potential buyers. Disney, for instance, considered making a bid for the company, but ultimately opted not to. An earlier version of this article misstated the origins of #WomenBoycottTwitter. Kelly Ellis, a software engineer, was among those who popularized the campaign, she was not the first to post about the protest.",The New York Times
2017,Two New York Detectives Are Charged With Rape and Kidnapping,"Minutes after two New York detectives stopped an 18-year-old Brooklyn woman last month for having marijuana in her car, they placed her into handcuffs and put her into their police van, prosecutors said. Describing himself and his partner as “freaks,” one of the detectives forced the young woman to perform oral sex on him and raped her, prosecutors said, switching places within moments to let the other assault her, too. This chilling account was offered in court on Monday morning as the Brooklyn district attorney’s office unsealed a 50-count indictment against the detectives, Edward Martins and Richard Hall, charging them with rape, kidnapping and official misconduct. The indictment marked the district attorney’s office’s first formal statement on the allegations, details of which have been emerging in the news media for weeks. Detective Hall, 33, and Detective Martins, 37, surrendered on Monday at the 94th Precinct station house in Williamsburg. At their arraignment in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, both pleaded not guilty and were released on bail. Their lawyers vowed to vigorously fight the charges, arguing that prosecutors had given too much credence to the woman’s “uncorroborated” claims and suggesting that the encounter was consensual. Even in a city that has seen its share of police corruption — from the systemic graft revealed by Frank Serpico in 1970s to the brutal attack of Abner Louima, who was sexually assaulted in 1997 by an officer wielding a broomstick — the allegations against Detectives Hall and Martins were remarkable for both the viciousness of the crimes and the raw abuse of power. Typically, when officers are charged with crimes, their colleagues come to court in a sea of blue uniforms to support them. But on Monday, not one officer appeared in court with Detectives Martins and Hall. According to a detailed account delivered by a prosecutor, Frank DeGaetano, the incident occurred on Sept. 15, when Detectives Hall and Martins were conducting operations in the Coney Island neighborhood as part of an antidrug unit, Brooklyn South Narcotics. Around 8 p.m., Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives broke off from the rest of their team and stopped an Infinity coupe in Calvert Vaux Park. The 18-year-old woman was driving, he said; two of her friends, both men, were also in the car. As the detectives — both in plainclothes — approached the car, one of them shined his flashlight through the window and saw the young woman adjusting her bra. When Detective Hall asked if she was hiding something, she told him she was simply adjusting her nipple piercing, Mr. DeGaetano said. The detectives asked her to prove it, and the young woman lifted up her shirt, showing them her breasts. A search of the car revealed a small amount of marijuana in a cup holder. The woman also had some marijuana and a few pills of Klonopin, an anti-anxiety drug, in her handbag, Mr. DeGaetano said. At that point, he added, the detectives took the woman from the car, placed her in handcuffs and put her into the second row of their Dodge police van. Driving off, they told her that she would be released within a few hours at the 60th Precinct station house. Mr. DeGaetano said that Detective Martins used his cellphone to call the woman’s friends and explicitly instructed them not to follow the van, using a blocking function to disguise the number he was calling from. It was then that Detective Martins sat down next to the woman and said that he and his partner were “freaks,” asking her what she wanted to do to avoid being arrested, Mr. DeGaetano said. After tightening the handcuffs, Detective Martins pulled out his penis and forced the woman to perform oral sex on him, Mr. DeGaetano said. Then he turned her around, pulled her pants down and raped her, Mr. DeGaetano added, as Detective Hall watched through the rearview mirror and the young woman cried and pleaded with Detective Martins to stop. By that point, Mr. DeGaetano said, the van was in Bay Ridge, at least four miles from where the antidrug team had been working. Mr. DeGaetano said that Detective Hall switched places with his partner and also forced the woman to perform oral sex on him. After the attack, Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives returned to Coney Island and dropped the woman off about five blocks from their station house. Before she left, they made her take one of her Klonopin pills and told her to “keep her mouth shut,” Mr. DeGaetano said. Within days, the city medical examiner’s office had analyzed a rape test performed on the woman and determined that it contained samples of both detectives’ sperm, Mr. DeGaetano said. “These are extremely serious charges,” he added, saying that each could face up to 25 years in prison. Detective Martins, who joined the Police Department in July 2006, had his bail set at $250,000, and Detective Hall, who joined in July 2010, had his bail set at $150,000. Both were suspended and demoted on Friday, after the grand jury handed up the indictment. Even with physical evidence like DNA, rape prosecutions are often difficult. A court document filed on Monday hinted at some of the vulnerabilities defense lawyers may seek to exploit. One day after the encounter, investigators from the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau interviewed her and found she that while she could identify Detective Hall from a photo array, she was unable to identify Detective Martins, according to the court document. The document also showed that her two friends were also unable to identify Detective Martins and that one of them misidentified Detective Hall. Calling the indictment “schizophrenic,” John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Hall, noted at the arraignment that the charges included accusations of both “forcible” rape and of using sex to bribe a police officer — a “self-contradictory” position, suggesting that the prosecutors had two theories of the case and were not entirely confident about the young woman’s account. Mark A. Bederow, Detective Martins’s lawyer, said his client had been subjected for weeks to a “circus” of allegations made in the media by the young woman’s lawyer, Michael David. Mr. Bederow called the woman’s account “uncorroborated.” He told Justice Danny K. Chun, who is handling the case, that while prosecutors had furnished DNA evidence, they had not provided surveillance footage connected to the attack, which allegedly took place in the parking lot of a Chipotle restaurant, nor of the detectives releasing the woman near the station house. Mr. Bederow added that he had “substantial information” that would undermine her story, suggesting that she had a “financial” motive to lie about the attack. At a news conference after the arraignment, Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, asked anyone who may have had similar encounters with the detectives to come forward. He also condemned the detectives’ lawyers for attacking the victim. “It is shocking and unfortunate that they would blame a teenager for the acts of their clients,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “To think that these are grown men in a position of power over an 18-year-old, and for them to blame her, is ridiculous and demeaning. To my mind it speaks to desperation.” An earlier version of this article misstated the details of the accusations against Detective Richard Hall. He was indicted on charges of forcing oral sex and acting in concert with the alleged rape of the 18-year-old woman by Detective Edward Martins; he has not been accused of raping the woman.",The New York Times
2017,"Two Teams, One Anthem: An N.F.L. Showdown","On Pro Football SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The Civil Rights movement had Selma as a touchstone; the gay rights uprising took flight at the Stonewall Inn; and the N.F.L players’ campaign for social justice on Sunday had Levi’s Stadium as its epicenter. It was here last year that Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the playing of the national anthem in protest of racial oppression after several police shootings of black Americans. On Sunday, it might as well have been Little Big Horn for the home team. The Dallas Cowboys’ 40-10 shellacking of the 49ers was the franchise’s worst defeat since 1980 and kept them winless for the seventh straight game. Who won the national anthem showdown? It depends on your point of view. The 49ers’ Eric Reid, who knelt alongside Kaepernick last season, did so again Sunday, as did six teammates, down from about two dozen at the peak a few weeks ago. Every player on the Cowboys, widely known as America’s team, remained upright, no doubt pleasing the team’s owner, Jerry Jones, who said players who disrespected the flag in his view by sitting or kneeling would not play. Against Green Bay this month, defensive linemen Damontre Moore and David Irving had raised fists at the anthem’s conclusion. On Sunday, Irving raised his fist briefly, and Moore briefly did so, too, but only after the anthem was over. “I know that he was very deliberate during the anthem and of course that’s the issue with me,” Jones said of Irving after the game. In fact, the vast majority of N.F.L. players chose the Cowboys’ way when it came to the anthem on Sunday, suggesting enthusiasm for mixing football and politics is waning. Eleven owners met with players and officials from the league and the players’ union last week to find a graceful way out of the impasse. Notably absent was Jones. He holds close two statistics: How many players are protesting and what the demonstrations are doing to the bottom line. Through Week 6, the N.F.L. is down slightly in TV ratings, though that can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the continuing decline of cable television subscribers. Last month, after President Trump called for any “son of a bitch” who knelt during the anthem to be fired, several owners stood with their teams for the anthem. None was as calculating as Jones. He linked arms with his team and knelt, then all rose before the anthem played. No matter. Jones said that the team office was inundated with calls, emails and letters objecting to the gesture. Jones may have been in an ebullient mood after the game Sunday, giving atta-boys to his players for the rout that brought the Cowboys to 3-3. He was expansive on the three-touchdown performance of running back Ezekiel Elliott, who won a temporary injunction to hold off his six-game suspension by the N.F.L. for his role in a domestic-violence case. Still, the anthem controversy was on his mind. “There is no question the league is suffering negative effects from this protest,” he said. Trump on Monday tried to keep the fires burning, sending out a tweet that said, “Two dozen N.F.L. players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country. No leadership in NFL!” What he overlooks is that over the past year, N.F.L. players have sustained a national dialogue about social justice that often only briefly pops up after police shootings or society-rending riots. Whether you like it or not, the N.F.L is among the most watched pieces of entertainment on the planet, with a massive platform. Many players have used it to provide poignant moments. The Seahawks’ Michael Bennett brought a military wife to tears of understanding as he exchanged views with veterans outside the gates of the team’s practice complex. His teammate Doug Baldwin Jr. joined N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman in support of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2017. The Steelers’ Alejandro Villanueva, a West Point graduate with a Bronze Star for valor as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, memorably stood by himself with his hand over his heart during the anthem as his team waited off field. He then movingly explained why he could not turn his back on the flag and apologized to his teammates for botching the team’s plans and making them look bad. None of it has done much good for Kaepernick or the team that he once took to the Super Bowl. Last week, he filed a complaint against the N.F.L., accusing all 32 teams of colluding to keep him out of the league. He is an activist now and has more than likely kissed away whatever slim chance he had to play in the N.F.L again. On Sunday, there were plenty of empty seats here and about half the filled ones were inhabited by fans wearing the blue and white of the Cowboys. Levi’s Stadium hasn’t been a popular home for the 49ers since opening in 2014. Fans complain that the tickets are too expensive and the commute is too far from San Francisco. Still, it was a jarring sight on an afternoon that San Francisco legend Joe Montana and more than 30 members of the 49ers’ Super Bowl winning teams were here at halftime to honor another icon, Dwight Clark, who is battling the neurological disease A.L.S. It was Montana and Clark who teamed up for “The Catch” in 1982, one of the most famous plays in N.F.L history, a 6-yard pass in the back of the end zone in the final minute to beat the Cowboys and advance to the Super Bowl. Those glory days seem like ancient history. In the locker room after the game, Kaepernick and social awareness meant little to a winless and beaten up team. C. J. Beathard, the rookie quarterback who was sacked five times, summed up the 49ers’ season like a 10-year veteran. Sure, it was a massacre, but hardly a last stand. “Yeah, we are 0-7. There’s only one way to go, and that’s up,” he told reporters. “And we’ve got a lot of season left ahead of us to get better, turn the season around and make something out of it.”",The New York Times
2017,"Two Women, and Their Dogs, Rescued After Nearly 5 Months Lost at Sea","They were supposed to trade one island paradise for another: a monthlong sailing trip in spring, from Honolulu to Tahiti. But on Wednesday morning, they were discovered in the wrong hemisphere, 5,000 miles off course and nearly six months into a dream that had curdled into a nightmare. Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiaba were rescued by the Navy vessel the Ashland 900 miles south of Japan, according to a statement released by the Navy on Thursday. After setting out in early May, a storm claimed their 50-foot boat’s engine on May 30. They spent the next five months adrift at sea and unable to make contact with others. The two friends survived on a water purifier and a store of oatmeal, pasta and rice, with two pet dogs, Zeus and Valentine, to keep them company. “I had tears in my eyes,’’ Ms. Appel said of the moment she saw the Navy ship approaching, according to The Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “It was incredibly emotional.” In a video released by the Navy, she blows kisses with two hands as her rescuers arrive; Zeus and Valentine yap and circle excitedly in the background. Ms. Appel, who said she had lived in Hawaii for 10 years, began planning the trip two and a half years ago out of a desire to further explore the South Pacific. But after their engine flooded, the plan went awry. Ms. Appel and Ms. Fuiaba at first believed they could get to their destination using only the boat’s sails. But two months into a journey that ordinarily takes half that long, they began to issue daily distress calls using a high-frequency radio. For 98 days, no one answered. “It was very depressing and very hopeless,” Ms. Appel said. Their boat had been too far out of range to communicate with anyone either on land or at sea. “There is true humility to wondering if today is your last day, if tonight is your last night.” In an interview with The Associated Press, Ms. Appel’s mother, Joyce Appel, said she had called the Coast Guard after being unable to reach her daughter a week and a half into the trip. By that point, Ms. Appel’s mobile phone had fallen overboard. A Coast Guard search-and-rescue mission turned up empty, but Ms. Appel’s mother still believed her daughter would return. “I had hope all along, she is very resourceful and she’s curious and as things break, she tries to repair them,” she told The Associated Press. “She doesn’t sit and wait for the repairman to get there, so I knew the same thing would be true of the boat.” The Ashland, a ready-response vessel that operates out of Sasebo, Japan, was alerted to the location of Ms. Appel and Ms. Fuiaba’s boat by a Taiwanese fishing vessel on Oct. 24, according to the Navy. The next morning, nearly half a year of anguished uncertainty came to an end. “They saved our lives,” Ms. Appel said in the Navy statement. She described the feeling of seeing a ship on the horizon as “pure relief.” Ms. Appel and Ms. Fuiaba are currently aboard the Ashland, where they will remain until its next port of call. Their boat, deemed unseaworthy, was left behind.",The New York Times
2017,Two of Menendez’s Senate Colleagues Defend His Character,"NEWARK — Over 18 days of testimony, prosecutors in Senator Robert Menendez’s corruption trial have portrayed him as greedily accepting stays at luxury hotels and rides on private planes from a wealthy friend who wanted the senator’s help to resolve business disputes. For eight days, the defense has countered that Mr. Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, is a hard-working, honorable public servant who cares about policies and did not cross any legal line to provide personal favors. On Thursday, the defense team dug deep into its arsenal and put on the stand in Federal District Court here two of Mr. Menendez’s colleagues, Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat and the junior senator from New Jersey, and Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, in a high-profile, bipartisan appearance that injected some electricity into the slow-moving trial. The two men had not made the trip from Washington to testify about any specific evidence that is at the heart of the case. Instead, they came to vouch for Mr. Menendez’s character. “He’s a very honest, trustworthy man in that he keeps his word when he gives it, that he tries to get to yes, and that he pushes back against political pressure, which is hard in my business,” Mr. Graham said. While Mr. Graham’s testimony was generally subdued and matter-of-fact, Mr. Booker was more emotional and, at times, spoke directly to the jury. “One of the best things about politics for me the last four years is I get to work with Bob Menendez,” Mr. Booker said near the end of his testimony, after which he walked to the defendant’s table and shook Mr. Menendez’s hand. At the end of Thursday’s court session, Mr. Menendez expressed his gratitude toward the two senators. “I want to thank my colleagues,’’ he told reporters, “for their extraordinary courage to come and testify in a trial that wasn’t necessarily in their interest to do. I appreciate them coming forth and telling the jury about who I really am.” In the morning, just before the trial resumed in a fourth-floor courtroom, Mr. Menendez grinned and shook hands with the many supporters who sat behind him. Alongside Mr. Menendez were the team of lawyers defending him and Dr. Solomon Melgen, the senator’s co-defendant. Dr. Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor from Florida, is accused of bribery for bestowing lavish gifts on Mr. Menendez in exchange for the senator’s intervention in disputes. Both men have pleaded not guilty. The courtroom chatter quieted when Mr. Graham, in response to being sworn in, answered “I do” in a Southern accent that had not been heard before during the two-month trial. “Can you see me over this?” Mr. Graham asked the courtroom, referring to a computer monitor. At one point, Judge William H. Wells cut the senator off when he began to stray from a question posed by Mr. Menendez’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, about whether he and Mr. Menendez agreed on most issues. “I’m not here because I agree or disagree with him, I’m here because I know him. Here’s the thing about Bob,” Mr. Graham began, before Judge Wells interjected and told him to stay on topic. When Mr. Booker took the stand, he mentioned his home in Newark in praising Mr. Menendez. “I live a couple miles from here in a neighborhood that is very poor, and I don’t care who you are in America, Italian, Irish, Black, Latino, you are not that far from struggle and hurt,” Mr. Booker said. “A lot of us forget where we come from. What I think is honorable about Bob is not because of what he’s done for me. It’s Bob has not forgotten where he comes from.” Mr. Booker laughed as he told a story about the 2013 day he was sworn in. Mr. Menendez, he said, had to teach him how to cast votes by raising his hand and saying “aye.” Mr. Graham testified that his friendship with Mr. Menendez had grown over the past eight years during the long hours they spent working on immigration reform legislation and the Iran nuclear arms deal. They also shared a habit of having a late breakfast in the Senate cafeteria. Mr. Graham said he would walk over to chat with Mr. Menendez “almost literally every day.” Though their friendship did not always cross party lines — in September Mr. Menendez vowed that he would skip a day of his trial if he was needed to vote against a health bill Mr. Graham sponsored that would have replaced the Affordable Care Act — Mr. Graham described his colleague as a person of integrity. “He’s been somebody you can go to as a Republican, you can go to to find bipartisanship,” Mr. Graham said. “A handshake is all you need from Bob.” In a brief cross-examination, prosecutors asked both senators the same one question. Had they been inside the courtroom over the past eight weeks to hear the evidence against Mr. Menendez? Both gave the same answer — no.",The New York Times
2017,Tyrrell Hatton Goes Through a Swing of Emotions,"Turkish Open Don’t expect golfer Tyrrell Hatton of England to hang up his spikes to spin records in one of London’s hippest nightclubs any time soon. Yet not long ago, the 26-year-old European Tour pro was presented with that unlikely scenario. He squirmed in his chair as a TV personality bombarded him with questions in search of a window into his soul. But when asked if he were to D.J., what would his stage name be, he didn’t hesitate. “Head case Hatton,” he said, breaking into laughter. Hatton said the name simply popped into his head, but if there’s a grain of truth in every joke, this one contained more than that. Hatton is the first to concede that he’s the type that wears his emotions on his sleeve, the downside of which is his tendency to be one loose swing or bad break away from self-combustion. “I’ve always been a bit hotheaded and it’s something I need to improve on,” he said. Some observers say it has prevented him from reaching his potential. But at his last two starts, Hatton has had a firm grip on his temper, becoming the first to defend his title at the European Tour’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship early this month, and claiming the Italian Open with a run of five birdies on the final seven holes. The back-to-back titles have lifted Hatton to No. 17 in the official world golf ranking, a new personal-best, No. 5 in the European Tour’s Race to Dubai, and the early pacesetter in the European Ryder Cup standings. To think: Hatton could have netted three wins in a row if not for a subpar performance at the British Masters on Oct. 1 that dropped him from one shot off the pace entering the final round to a share of eighth place. More troubling than his result was his on-course behavior, which included pounding his putter on a spike mark on the green. “He’s a lot like Jordan Spieth in that if he hits a bad shot he likes to discuss it,” said Hatton’s father, Jeff, who doubles as his swing instructor. “Tyrrell gets a little more disgusted. He shows his frustration, but then it’s gone. You’ll find he’s more of a gunfighter on the golf course. He’s not going to walk around the course like a robot with no expression.” The former European Tour pro Gary Evans took umbrage with Hatton’s behavior and wrote about it on Twitter. “You’re a great talent with potential but you need to grow up, mate,” Evans wrote. “Your on-course whining and body language is a disgrace.” Evans isn’t the only one who thinks that if Hatton can learn to control his emotions better and accept his failures, he is capable of achieving stardom. “I can see a little bit of myself in him,” said Henrik Stenson, the 2016 British Open champion who is known for losing his cool. “He’s got that desire and when it doesn’t turn out the way he wants he’ll be very upset with himself. That’s something he’s going to have to deal with over time. You don’t want to take that fire out, but you don’t want it to be a burden, either.” Hatton’s impressive streak comes on the heels of his biggest slump. He missed six cuts between the United States Open and P.G.A. Championship, and the lone weekend he played was at the Bridgestone Invitational, which had no cut. “If you told me in the summer that I was going to win again before the end of the year, I probably wouldn’t have believed you,” he said. Hatton, who calls himself a feel player, blamed his poor form on a case of paralysis by analysis. He began listening to too many voices instead of trusting his ability. He learned the game at a young age from his father, a 7-handicap player who taught out of a homemade studio in the family garage in the English town of Marlow. He spent five days in a row in his father’s studio, returning to their tried-and-true routine before his swing clicked. He then went to Switzerland and finished tied for third at the Omega European Masters. “All he needed was a reset,” Jeff Hatton said. His game has been terrific since his father’s tuneup. First, he carved up the Old Course at St. Andrews, one of three host courses for the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, en route to shooting 24 under and a three-stroke victory over his countryman Ross Fisher. In Italy, Hatton began the final round in a tie for second, two shots behind, but fell four shots off the lead at the turn after a sluggish start. He carded four consecutive birdies beginning at No. 12 and signed for 65. A playoff loomed unless Hatton could hole a 15-foot birdie putt at the last. “I had a good feeling standing over it,” he said. “My hands were shaking, knees were shaking and I was nervous. That’s the feelings you want to have.” When the putt fell, Hatton was unable to restrain his excitement. He punched the air. Joy. Ecstasy. Relief. His emotions poured out. “The fire is still burning inside and I’ll show that from time to time,” he said. “It was a battle with myself today, to be honest. I was fighting so hard to stay patient.” Hatton’s late-round heroics further confirmed that there was a measure of truth in another of his answers to the rapid-fire questions he fielded. “Always lose or never play?” He picked the latter. “I hate losing,” he said.",The New York Times

2017,T’s The Greats Issue: Editor’s Letter,"Editor’s Letter On April 4, I was named the editor in chief of this magazine. On April 5, I started worrying about this issue. Our annual Greats issue is by far our most consuming and complicated endeavor of the year, a project by turns exhilarating and panic-inducing. The giddiness of getting to spotlight the people we admire is equaled only by the frustration its logistics inspire. Once we’ve determined our final group, the challenge (and fun) of pairing them with the most surprising writers, the most provocative photographers, begins. But things invariably go wrong — schedules (the photographer’s, the writer’s, the stylist’s and, crucially, the subject’s) misalign; flights get missed; clothes fail to arrive. Yet despite these inevitable minor disasters, I loved being a part of this issue. For one, it’s a profoundly collaborative endeavor. I’m lucky to work with people who sympathize with their colleagues’ disappointments (both on and off the page) and rejoice in their triumphs. But this issue collapses divisions between departments like no other — fashion editors get to work with text editors who get to work with photo editors with an intensity that they don’t normally. A magazine is a molecule whose atoms are sometimes kept separate; with the Greats, that separateness disappears. The issue also reflects the diversity of perspectives and tastes among T’s editors. The planning begins with an all-staff gathering in April, one at which every department — fashion, edit, art, photography and digital — is present. Then we go around the room and everyone makes suggestions. The meeting quickly becomes charged, at times heated, as people argue for or against their picks (“You think she’s a Great?! No way”; “There’s no doubt he’s great ... but is he a Great?”); coalitions hastily assemble, with teams advocating for their person, their Great. Occasionally, someone emerges as a unanimous choice, someone whose very name elicits a sigh of recognition from the staff: Of course that person’s a Great. No argument. (Only two of our seven cover stars were unanimous choices. I’m obviously not going to say which two.) And anyway, unanimity isn’t the important quality here. This is a magazine that traffics in the subjective. The people we’ve included here are not, and can never be, the best in their respective fields, because in art, there is never such a thing as the best. There are only the people who merely contribute to their medium (which is hard enough) ... and those who, in some way, change it — change it so completely that we begin to categorize art or theater or music or design by what existed before them, and what existed after. The artist Claes Oldenburg, one of the last surviving and arguably most influential of the Pops, did this with his comically enormous soft sculptures of everyday items — ice cream cones, hamburgers, slices of cake — and in so doing, Randy Kennedy notes, removed sculpture from the realm of the monument. His works may be towering, but they are also human-size. Then there’s Stephen Sondheim, the unmatched composer and lyricist of musical theater, among whose many achievements is, as Lin-Manuel Miranda writes, “demolish[ing] any notions of the kinds of stories musical theater can tell.” Only Sondheim could have found inspiration in violent barbers, ancient Roman farce and, even, the subject of creativity itself. Creativity also finds new expression in the gleefully, operatically bloody works of director Park Chan-wook, who has managed to both single-handedly define what Korean contemporary cinema is while at the same time reinventing film altogether. Or, on the other side of the camera, there’s the actress Amy Adams, who — as anyone who’s seen her films knows — can often convey what another actor might need pages of script to communicate simply by a widening of her arresting, expressive eyes. That heightened ability to communicate is one of the qualities that has made the writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie one of those rarest of people: a celebrated novelist who has also become a leading public intellectual. In a culturally splintered age, her writings — on race, feminism and American privilege — feel bracing, and true. Finally, there’s Nicki Minaj, whose intelligence, ferocity, rhythmic and performative genius and sheer determination offers a rebuke to anyone — man, critic, fellow artist — who might dare to dismiss her. I said earlier that essentially, this is an issue — and a magazine, for that matter — dedicated to celebrating the people we admire. The first time I bought one of the designer Dries Van Noten’s tops, I was 30. (This was some time ago.) It was a simple-but-not shell of rust-colored silk, and it was on sale, and I had saved up for it: After it was mine, I wore it carefully, and infrequently, worried I would damage it. What I didn’t know then was that for the next 13 years, I would buy at least one piece from every one of his collections — nor that I would have the chance to speak to him one day. It is almost never a good idea to meet artists you so respect (you invariably become either a babbling idiot or a grinning mute), but there are few experiences more humbling, or mysterious, than getting to talk with someone who thinks in images, and in colors, that you can only try to imagine. As I discovered when I spent time with Van Noten at his house outside Antwerp last July, a profile is both a writer’s attempt to explain to her readers why and how a person does what they do — but it is also the writer’s attempt to explain to herself why she reacts to that person’s art or creation the way she does. Van Noten, and all our Greats, sees the world fundamentally differently than we do; their generosity lies in their attempt to share it with the rest of us. I’d like to close this letter with some thanks: first, of course, to our Greats, who gave us their time, selves and trust. And second, to T’s extraordinary staff, in particular to photography director Nadia Vellam and staff editor M.H. Miller, who responded to a number of 11th-hour crises with their characteristic stoicism, ingenuity and resourcefulness. Take notice, fellow T’ers: Next year, the planning begins in January.",The New York Times
2017,U.K. Lawmakers Ask Facebook About Russian Influence in Brexit Vote,"LONDON — Parliament is asking Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies for information about Russian efforts to use social media to influence the British vote to leave the European Union, expanding on several parallel American congressional investigations around the election of President Trump. The British inquiry adds to the mounting pressure for more disclosure from the internet giants, which have already acknowledged broad Russian efforts to influence national elections in both the United States and France. Any indication of Russian meddling in the British vote last year to leave the European Union could raise doubts about the integrity of the outcome, further complicating the already vexed domestic politics surrounding the departure, commonly called Brexit. The Kremlin, which has long viewed the European Union as a threat, had a strong interest in promoting the groups that favored Britain’s leaving the bloc. And the most visible tools of Russian propaganda, like the English-language broadcaster RT and the news agency Sputnik, heavily supported the initiative. The leave camp won with 52 percent of ballots cast, about 1.3 million more votes than the remain side drew. “Any interference in the democratic process of the United Kingdom by people acting illegitimately is a serious matter,” Damian Collins, a Conservative who heads a parliamentary committee leading an inquiry into “fake news,” wrote in a letter released on Tuesday that requested information from Twitter. Mr. Collins sent a similar letter to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook. Both letters were dated Oct. 19. A member of Mr. Collins’s staff said the committee was also in contact with Google, but no company has responded. A spokesman for Facebook said the company would respond “once we have had the opportunity to review the request.” A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment, but said in an email that the company was adapting to “patterns of malicious activity” and now catches more than 3.2 million suspicious accounts each week. The company says that is more than twice what it detected each week last year, in the period before the Brexit referendum. It was unclear how much of that difference was attributable to better detection and how much to a growing number of suspect accounts. A recent academic study found 13,493 suspected “bot” accounts that appeared to send out automated messages related to the referendum in the run-up to the vote but were removed in its immediate aftermath. But the Twitter spokesman cited other research suggesting that the company’s improving detection made bots less common. Facebook has acknowledged that Russian agents covertly bought advertising on its platform in an effort to swing the 2016 presidential election in favor of Mr. Trump. The company said in September that it was turning over more than 3,000 Russian-linked ads to congressional committees investigating interference in the race. Some of the Russian-linked content sought to influence the election obliquely, by inflaming social issues or racial tensions. Facebook disclosed earlier that month that a Russian company had spent $100,000 on ads connected to 470 bogus accounts. The company also said it had removed as many as 30,000 fake accounts seeking to influence the French election. That has led some involved in the congressional investigations to believe the number of fake accounts active in the United States was probably far higher than the 470 detected. In an online video statement, Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook acknowledged in September that social media companies were grappling with an unforeseen problem. “It is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation-states attempting to subvert elections,” he said, adding, “We are committed to rising to the occasion.” The British inquiries were a reasonable next step, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday. “Russian active measures didn’t begin, or end, with the American presidential election,” he said. “America’s allies all need to be on guard against Russian propaganda and misinformation.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.K. Reports Big Rise in Hate Crime, Citing Brexit and Terrorist Attacks","LONDON — The referendum on British membership in the European Union and several terrorist attacks, including a suicide bombing after a concert in Manchester, England, have helped drive hate crimes in Britain to record levels, official figures showed on Tuesday. The Home Office said that 80,393 hate crimes were reported during the 12 months to March of this year, an increase of nearly 30 percent and the largest year-to-year rise in the five years that data has been collected. The increase was “larger than anticipated,” said Paul Iganski, a hate crimes expert and professor of criminology at Lancaster University. The “Brexit” campaign last year to leave the European Union was supported by some right-wing and nationalist groups, and the vote gave rise to concerns that minorities and immigrants would be more vulnerable to hate crimes. In addition, provisional data collected around the time of terrorist attacks this year in London and in Manchester, where the bombing outside the Ariana Grande concert left 22 dead, found that hate crimes soon followed the attacks. But the rise can be attributed in part to increased public awareness and changes in the law, which broadened the definition of hate crimes to the point that almost any verbal or physical assault can be categorized as one if the victim interprets it as such. Many of the changes stem from the racially charged murder of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old black man who was stabbed while waiting for a bus in southeast London in 1993. The authorities have also improved their capacity to record and document attacks, and victims are widely believed to feel more comfortable going to the police. “Britain is no more or less bigoted than any other country, for example in Europe,” said Professor Iganski, adding that the increase “reflects the advances made by the criminal justice and the police” in dealing with hate crimes. Nearly 80 percent of such crimes were based on race, according to the report. About 10 percent were based on sexual orientation and 7 percent on religion. Seven percent of hate crimes were based on a person’s disability and a further 2 percent were transgender-related hate crimes. (It is possible for a hate crime to have more than one motivating factor, the report said.) The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said that there was “absolutely no place” for hate crime in Britain, and that she welcomed the news that victims were more confident that the authorities would treat hate-crime accusations seriously. “But no one in Britain should have to suffer violent prejudice,” she said, “and indications that there was a genuine rise in the number of offenses immediately following each of this year’s terror attacks is undoubtedly concerning.” The number of hate crimes decreased in the days after attacks in London in March, outside Parliament, and after the Manchester attack in April, but then rose again after the attack on London Bridge and Borough Market in early June, and then after an attack in the Finsbury neighborhood of London later that month, the Home Office said in its report. “I think they’ll continue to rise,” Professor Iganski said. “As the Brexit negotiations become more entrenched, they’re a constant reminder of the position of eastern European migrants, contributing to a climate of hostility. As we draw closer to the deadline, and as negotiations get tougher, the climate is going to get worse. And every time we have a terror attack there’ll be a backlash. Each time it goes up a notch.” The hate crime figures were released on the same day that the head of the country’s domestic spy service, MI5, warned that Britain was facing a surge in terrorist threats that were increasingly hard to detect and on a scale previously unseen. “We’re contending with an intense U.K. terrorist threat from Islamist extremists,” the organization’s chief, Andrew Parker, said in a rare speech in London. “That threat is multidimensional, evolving rapidly and operating at a scale and pace we’ve not seen before.” “Attacks can sometimes accelerate from inception through planning to action in just a handful of days,” Mr. Parker added.",The New York Times
2017,U.N. Draft Blacklist of Child Killers Includes Saudi Arabia,"The United Nations has placed Saudi Arabia on a draft blacklist of countries that kill and maim children in war, a contentious decision that, if finalized, could enrage one of the organization’s most generous donors. A draft of the annual list, seen Wednesday by The New York Times, includes the Saudi-led coalition of Arab countries that has bombed Yemen for more than two years in a war to rout Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who control much of the country, including the capital, Sana. The Houthis, who are backed by Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival, also are on the blacklist. Subject to final revisions, the blacklist is expected to be made public in the coming days. United Nations officials declined to comment on the draft, which was first reported by Reuters. Essentially a naming-and-shaming mechanism, the blacklist is one of the most politically sensitive documents published by the United Nations. It lumps government armies of some countries like Syria and Sudan together with extremist groups like Boko Haram and the Islamic State. The United Nations describes it as a “list of parties that recruit or use children, kill or maim children, commit rape and other forms of sexual violence against children, or engage in attacks on schools and/or hospitals, or abduct children in situations of armed conflict.” It was compiled by Virginia Gamba, the secretary general’s special representative on children and armed conflict. The final version is appended as an annex to an annual report submitted to the United Nations Security Council. The Saudis strongly protested last year when the secretary general at the time, Ban Ki-moon, placed their coalition on the blacklist because of the bombings in Yemen, which have killed hundreds of children and hit targets that included hospitals and schools. Mr. Ban then promptly removed the coalition from the list and suggested that the Saudis had threatened to withhold United Nations funding if he had refused. The Saudis, who have donated hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the United Nations, including for the humanitarian crisis caused by the Yemen war, denied exerting pressure on Mr. Ban. This year, Mr. Ban’s successor, António Guterres, delayed publication of the 2017 report and blacklist for months. In what appeared to be a concession to Saudi Arabia, the draft blacklist distinguishes, for the first time, parties that have taken steps “aimed at improving the protection of children” from those that have not. The Saudi coalition is listed in the “improving” category, while the Houthis are listed among those that have made no improvements to protect children. Whether such a distinction will mollify Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners remains unclear. According to a draft of the 2017 report — which was leaked a few months ago and is used as the basis to compile the blacklist — the Saudi coalition was responsible for 683 child casualties in Yemen in 2016, while the Houthis and their allies were responsible for 414. Saudi diplomatic officials at the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment, but the Saudi ambassador, Abdallah Y. al-Mouallimi, has said previously that inclusion on the blacklist is unacceptable. In recent weeks, Mr. Mouallimi has helped lead an intensive publicity campaign to highlight Saudi Arabia’s humanitarian efforts in Yemen and elsewhere. Mr. Mouallimi also wrote an Op-Ed article, published Wednesday in the international edition of The New York Times, blaming what he described as stubborn defiance by the Houthis for prolonging the conflict with their “unlawful hold on power.” Advocacy groups for children, which have strongly protested the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen, were appalled last year when Mr. Ban removed the Saudi-led coalition from the blacklist. They welcomed word that the coalition appeared to have been listed again. “Naming the coalition as responsible in the secretary-general’s annual report is hopefully the first step in holding it accountable and stopping these atrocities,” Eva Smets, executive director of the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict, said in a statement. “The leaked documents also indicate the secretary-general believes the Saudi-led coalition has taken positive measures,” Ms. Smets said, “but we continue to receive disturbing reports of children dying from preventable diseases and the coalition’s bombs.” Opinion",The New York Times
2017,"U.N. Officials Condemn Arrests of Gays in Azerbaijan, Egypt and Indonesia","GENEVA — United Nations officials on Friday condemned the recent mass arrests of gay and transgender people in Azerbaijan, Egypt and Indonesia, saying that the authorities in those countries had violated international law by detaining, mistreating and torturing them. The roundups — of about 80 people in Azerbaijan, 50 in Egypt and 50 in Indonesia over the past few weeks — do not appear to be connected, but United Nations officials said they exposed patterns of discrimination and abuse that also damage broad development goals. The authorities in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, have detained more than 80 people identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender since mid-September, reportedly subjecting some of them to beatings, electric shocks and forced shaving, Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters in Geneva. The police resorted to other forms of humiliation, including forcing many of those arrested to undergo medical examinations and then releasing the results or details of their medical status to the news media. The authorities in Baku said they were acting in response to public demands for a crackdown on prostitution, but lawyers for those detained said that most were not involved in the sex trade and that the charges were a pretext. All of those detained in Azerbaijan have been released, but some served short sentences on charges of “hooliganism” and “resisting a police order,” Mr. Colville said. He added that “any arrest based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity is by definition arbitrary and violates international law.” Egyptian authorities had arrested more than 50 people in recent weeks on the basis of their assumed sexual orientation or gender identity, some of them entrapped by law enforcement officials on websites and chat rooms, Mr. Colville said. Two people were arrested after they waved rainbow flags during a rock concert, he said. The flag waving, at a performance by a Lebanese band with an openly gay singer, was shown on social media sites and provoked criticism as an attempt to disgrace Egypt. The police interrogated the two on charges that included “joining an outlawed group that aims to promote homosexuality.” Charges against those detained included “habitual debauchery,” “inciting indecency and debauchery,” and “joining a banned group,” Mr. Colville said. Some had been subjected to intrusive vaginal and anal examinations, he said, which have been condemned by the United Nations’ anti-torture panel as cruel, inhumane and degrading. A few of those arrested in Egypt have been released, but 10 men were sentenced to prison terms of one to six years and others were being held pending trial, he said. Egyptian human rights activists, who say the government has arrested more than 300 gay and transgender people since 2013, condemned the arrests as an attempt to distract public attention from social problems. The Indonesian police arrested 50 people at a sauna in the capital, Jakarta, a week ago “on the basis of their perceived sexual orientation,” Mr. Colville said. Many were released, but four men and one woman were charged under a “law on pornography” that Mr. Colville said had been used to punish people for same-sex relationships. He said the authorities in all three countries accused those arrested of being involved in sex work “although in almost all cases the accused have denied such allegations or indicated that they were coerced into confessing involvement.” Mr. Colville called on the three governments to release anyone detained on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity and drop charges based on vaguely worded and discriminatory laws. Twelve United Nations agencies called in June for an end to discrimination in health care and the elimination of laws that criminalize gender expression and relationships between consenting adults. They described such measures as violations of basic rights, as a threat to public health and as an obstacle to achieving development goals.",The New York Times
2017,U.N. Panel Points Finger at Syria in Sarin Attack on Village,"The Syrian Air Force was responsible for a lethal sarin chemical attack on a northern rebel-held village on April 4, a United Nations investigative panel said Thursday. Its report represented the first time that a politically independent investigation had concluded which side in the Syrian civil war had carried out the attack on the village, Khan Sheikhoun. The early morning attack killed dozens of civilians, including children, and is regarded as one of the worst chemical weapons atrocities in the conflict. The panel’s finding could place new pressure on Russia, the Syrian government’s most important ally, which pledged four years ago to ensure that President Bashar al-Assad purge all his chemical weapons. But the determination is also likely to be assailed by Russia as flawed, and could raise doubts about whether the panel, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, will be able to continue its work. A second finding in the report concluded that Islamic State militants had carried out an attack using sulfur mustard poison in Um-Housh, in Aleppo Province, on Sept. 16, 2016. The use of chemical weapons, a recurrent theme in the conflict that began nearly seven years ago, is a war crime. The investigative panel, created in 2015 by the United Nations Security Council to determine who has been using chemical weapons in Syria, is a collaboration of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, The Hague-based group that polices the global ban on such munitions. The panel’s latest report, which was shared with Security Council members and seen by The New York Times, said it was “confident that the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017.” Its previous reports have found that Syrian forces had used chlorine bombs at least three times in the conflict and that Islamic State fighters had used sulfur mustard at least once. But its investigation into who committed the Khan Sheikhoun assault was regarded as its most important undertaking yet. It also was seen as a barometer of whether Russia and the West, which support opposing sides in the Syrian war, could continue cooperating on efforts to hold chemical weapons users in Syria accountable. Western nations immediately seized on the panel’s conclusion as evidence of duplicity by Syria and Russia. “Time and again, we see independent confirmation of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime. And in spite of these independent reports, we still see some countries trying to protect the regime,” Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said in a statement. “That must end now.” Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson of Britain said the Khan Sheikhoun findings represented “an appalling breach of the rules of war,” and he called on “the international community to unite to hold Assad’s regime accountable.” The United States quickly concluded after the Khan Sheikhoun assault that the Syrian Air Force had been responsible, based partly on what the Americans said was intelligence that traced the attack to aircraft based at Al Shayrat, a Syrian military airfield. Two days after the sarin assault, President Trump authorized a Tomahawk missile strike on Al Shayrat, enraging Russia and Syria. It was the first direct American assault on a Syrian military target in the conflict. Russia had signaled before the Khan Sheikhoun report was finished that it would dispute any conclusion of Syrian government responsibility because of what Russia’s own experts called serious gaps in the panel’s investigation. The Russian experts expressed concern that investigators had not visited Khan Sheikhoun, and said their own surveillance photographs of the bomb site suggested that the crater was too small for the bomb to have been dropped from the air. With the panel’s mandate due to expire on Nov. 16, the Security Council must decide whether to renew it in the coming days. An American-led effort at the Security Council to renew the mandate for one year was blocked by a Russian veto on Tuesday. The Russians had said they wanted to see the results of the Khan Sheikhoun investigation first. Whether Russia will now oppose the renewal is not yet clear. The report’s conclusion on Khan Sheikhoun was not entirely unexpected because of other evidence that came to light immediately after the attack, including videos, suggesting an aircraft had dropped a bomb containing sarin on a street in the village. Only Syrian aircraft were known to be operating in that area, and the insurgents have no planes. Both Syria and Russia initially called the attack a fabrication, and Mr. Assad went so far as to speculate that child actors faking asphyxiation had been used in an elaborate deception by his enemies to portray him as a war criminal. But it quickly became clear from verified soil and blood samples of victims that sarin, a lethal nerve agent once stockpiled by Mr. Assad’s military, had been used. Syria and Russia then suggested that insurgents or other nonstate actors in Khan Sheikhoun had planted a sarin bomb on the ground. The panel said in its report that such a possibility had been explored but rejected, partly because of the large number of people affected and the presence of sarin for days after the attack, “which is consistent with it being dispersed via a chemical aerial bomb.” OpinionFadi Azzam",The New York Times
2017,U.N. Peacekeeping Chief Issues Warning on South Sudan,"The leader of United Nations’ peacekeeping operations offered a dire appraisal of South Sudan on Tuesday, saying the world’s youngest nation is sliding further into mayhem with no sign that its antagonists want peace. In a report to the United Nations Security Council, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the under secretary general of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, called upon the leaders of South Sudan’s warring factions to “bring the country back from the impending abyss.” Mr. Lacroix said that a diplomatic effort by eight African nations to revitalize a 2015 peace agreement in South Sudan had received only a “lukewarm response” from the government of President Salva Kiir, and that Mr. Kiir’s political adversaries also remained cautious about it. Despite the presence of 17,000 United Nations peacekeepers in South Sudan, Mr. Lacroix said that security had deteriorated and that armed clashes, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and other rights abuses had increased in much of the country. His report came a week before the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, is scheduled to visit South Sudan to press for a solution to the four-year-old civil war, which has left tens of thousands dead and has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. More than two million people have fled South Sudan and nearly two million have been displaced, totaling a third of the country’s population. United Nations relief officials have said extreme hunger threatens half the country. At least 200,000 South Sudanese are sheltering at United Nations peacekeeping bases. Ms. Haley, who will be the highest-ranking Trump administration official to travel to Africa, said last month that the eight-nation African diplomatic effort, known as the High Level Revitalization Forum, was “the last chance at salvaging the peace agreement in South Sudan.” She also pledged to the South Sudanese people in a Twitter posting that “we look forward to delivering the message in person very soon that we have not given up on them and have not forgotten them.” The United States is a leading aid provider to South Sudan and was a strong supporter of its independence from neighboring Sudan in 2011. Optimism about South Sudan’s prospects faded within a few years when an ethnic civil war erupted between forces loyal to President Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, and his former vice president, Riek Machar, a Nuer. Mr. Machar now lives in exile in South Africa.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Ambassador to U.N. Escalates Confrontation With Iran,"The Trump administration escalated a bitter confrontation with Iran on Wednesday, demanding that the United Nations Security Council punish the Iranian government for what the American ambassador called its “outlaw behavior” across the Middle East. “The United States will not turn a blind eye to these violations,” the United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, told a Security Council meeting that had been meant to focus on developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ms. Haley used her speaking time instead to deliver a critique of Iran. Her remarks were among the most strident denunciations Ms. Haley has made of Iran since she became President Trump’s ambassador in January. The remarks seemed timed partly to respond to international criticism of the administration over Mr. Trump’s avowed hostility to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major powers, including the United States, which he has described as an embarrassment and a disaster. She spoke less than a week after Mr. Trump announced that he would disavow the nuclear agreement and might withdraw the United States from the accord altogether unless it was strengthened to his satisfaction. That decision has deeply angered Iran — which has ruled out any renegotiation — and has raised alarms among many American allies, including Britain, France and Germany, which were among the parties to the agreement. They have exhorted Congress to preserve the deal, which they say is doing exactly what had been intended — thwarting Iran’s ability to attain a nuclear weapon. They have warned that the United States is risking isolation, loss of credibility and increased global insecurity if the deal unravels. Accusing the Iranian government of having violated at least four Security Council resolutions with impunity, Ms. Haley said that “nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran’s outlaw behavior.” She argued that the nuclear agreement was an insufficient instrument with which to measure Iran’s relations with the world. “Iran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior,” she said. “And we have allowed them to get away with it. This must stop.” Ms. Haley also demanded that the Council take action on what she called Iran’s “most threatening act”: ballistic missile launchings. A Security Council resolution that put the nuclear agreement into effect calls upon Iran to refrain from ballistic missile tests but does not prohibit them. Iran has argued that its missiles are a defensive countermeasure to deter hostile neighbors, notably Israel and Saudi Arabia, both close American allies. There was no indication that other Council members would act on Ms. Haley’s demands. China and Russia, veto-wielding members who also are parties to the Iran nuclear agreement, are strong supporters of it. More broadly, they oppose the Trump administration’s efforts to ostracize Iran. Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gholamali Khoshroo, offered what amounted to a diametrically opposite appraisal of Iran’s behavior in his Council remarks, saying “no country has done more than Iran” in fighting Middle East terrorism, most notably in fighting the Islamic State. “If we had hegemonic ambitions, the nuclear deal would never have been reached,” Mr. Khoshroo said. He said Mr. Trump’s approach “toward the deal and Iran run counter to all of these efforts and intend to add another crisis to the regional issues.” Hours earlier in Tehran, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, delivered a tough denunciation of Mr. Trump’s position on the nuclear deal and his other criticisms of Iran, calling it “a waste of time to respond to such blatherings and nonsensical remarks by the foulmouthed U.S. president.” In a speech to academics carried by Iranian state media, Ayatollah Khamenei said Iran would not renounce the nuclear agreement as long as the United States does not. “But if it does,” he said, “we will shred it to bits.” Mr. Trump’s decision announced last Friday not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement triggered a provision in American law that gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions that were rescinded under the accord. Ayatollah Khamenei’s remarks suggested that the reimposition of sanctions would be interpreted by Iran as an American withdrawal from the accord. It is unclear whether Congress will take that action. European leaders, including the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Federica Mogherini, who helped negotiate the nuclear agreement, have urged American lawmakers to preserve it. A growing number of disarmament advocates and diplomats also have publicly defended the agreement. In the latest indication of support, a group of 25 former foreign ministers said Wednesday in a letter to congressional leaders that the agreement was in the best interests of the United States. The signers included former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright of the United States and many of her counterparts from Europe and elsewhere. “A unilateral withdrawal from the agreement would have far-reaching adverse consequences for the security of the United States and America’s standing in the world,” the letter said. “We know from experience that the world counts on the United States to live up to its commitments,” it said. “If the United States loses its credibility, the consequences for its security, and the security of its allies, would be disastrous.” In a telephone interview, Ms. Albright said that the group of former ministers, which meets a few times a year, considered the nuclear agreement “such a good example of multilateral cooperation” that its members felt it was important to speak out. Ms. Albright, whose first diplomatic post was as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said she understood Ms. Haley’s concerns about Iran’s “counterproductive and dangerous” activities. Still, she said: “Everything would be more serious if they had a nuclear weapon. You’re safer if they don’t have one.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Budget Deficit Swells, Adding Wrinkle to G.O.P. Push for Tax Cut","WASHINGTON — The United States has recorded its largest annual budget deficit in four years, highlighting the nation’s worsening fiscal trajectory as lawmakers consider a $1.5 trillion tax cut. A Treasury Department report released on Friday showed that the budget deficit for fiscal 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion, as federal spending eclipsed revenues and economic growth remained tepid. The deficit also edged higher as a share of the economy, rising to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product from 3.2 percent last year. The ballooning deficit comes as Republican lawmakers push for deep tax cuts that could further swell the national debt, which has already topped $20 trillion. On Thursday night, the Senate passed a budget blueprint that would pave the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut. Deficit hawks, including many Republicans, have long cautioned against cutting taxes during a time of deficits. But lawmakers say the type of tax cuts they are considering will essentially pay for themselves by generating robust economic growth. “Through a combination of tax reform and regulatory relief, this country can return to higher levels of G.D.P. growth, helping to erase our fiscal deficit,” said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said that the widening deficit should serve as a “smoke alarm” to Washington and that “smart spending restraint,” along with a rewrite of the tax code and a reduction of red tape, is needed to get the economy growing faster. The Trump administration earlier this year produced a budget proposal that included draconian cuts to agencies that it said would yield a small surplus after 10 years. However, lawmakers from both parties dismissed most of the proposals, and the Congressional Budget Office found that the administration’s economic growth projections were overly optimistic. It projected that, under the plan, the budget deficit would amount to $720 billion, or 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, in 2027. The Congressional Budget Office said in January that it projects the federal debt will grow by $10 trillion over the next decade. This year, spending on so-called entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid all grew, as did expenses incurred by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has faced heavy costs associated with hurricane relief efforts. Democrats have been unified in their opposition to the budget and tax framework that Republicans have been drafting. They warn that rising deficits will slow economic growth and that, in turn, Republicans will look to cut safety net and other programs Democrats support. “With the deficit as large and growing as quickly as it is, Republicans pursuing a reckless plan that would blow a huge hole in the deficit and put Medicare and Medicaid at risk is the height of irresponsibility,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat. “Instead, Republicans should work with Democrats on tax reform that is deficit neutral and focused on the middle class.” Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said on Friday that it was startling how Republicans had given up caring about deficits now that they finally had the power to curb government spending. “The contrast between the growing deficit, which is back into troubling territory, with the blatant disregard for policies that are going to increase the debt is stunning and definitely bodes poorly for the economy,” she said.",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Clears Bill Browder to Enter, Rebuking Russia","MOSCOW — The United States effectively rejected a Russian criminal complaint against a prominent critic of the Kremlin on Monday and decided to allow him into the country, reversing an initial decision to bar his entry in response to the complaint after congressional leaders protested. The critic, William F. Browder, a prominent investor who has led an international campaign to punish Russian human rights abusers that has deeply irritated the Kremlin, said he was initially prevented from flying to the United States after Moscow put his name on an Interpol list of criminal fugitives but later announced that the ban had been lifted. “GREAT NEWS!” Mr. Browder wrote on Twitter on Monday night. “My ESTA (US visa waiver) was restored. I successfully checked into a US flight. Now we need to fix bogus Interpol arrest warrant.” A Trump administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss an individual visa case, said it appeared that the initial action blocking Mr. Browder had been taken automatically in response to an Interpol notice filed against him by Russia and was not an affirmative action by the American government. The original decision drew bipartisan objections from congressional leaders who have worked with Mr. Browder on legislation imposing sanctions on Russia in response to the death of his lawyer, Sergei L. Magnitsky, who was investigating official corruption. Senators John McCain, a Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Benjamin L. Cardin, a Democrat of Maryland and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a joint statement that the decision to block Mr. Browder’s entry should be reviewed. “William Browder is strong advocate for anti-corruption efforts around the world and we relied on his expertise and support as we led the effort to pass the Magnitsky Act,” they said, adding: “It would be unfortunate if the U.S. decided to bar him based on a decision by those same Russian officials who have been targeted by this important legislation.” Russian prosecutors have opened investigations into whether Mr. Browder himself murdered Mr. Magnitsky by conspiring with Russian prison doctors who withheld medical care. In the interview, Mr. Browder said he believed that the latest Interpol notice related to the original tax case, not the murder investigation. Mr. Browder championed legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012 imposing sanctions on Russians responsible for the death of Mr. Magnitsky, who died in custody after investigating corruption allegations involving Russian authorities. The law named for Mr. Magnitsky also singled out other Russians deemed to be violators of human rights. The Magnitsky Act has been a major point of friction between Washington and Moscow for years and led President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to cut off American adoptions of Russian children in retaliation. Mr. Putin raised the issue with President Trump in a meeting over the summer and it was said to have been the subject of a meeting that a Russian lawyer held with Donald J. Trump Jr., Mr. Trump’s son, during the height of last year’s campaign. In an interview on Monday, Mr. Browder linked his latest appearance on an Interpol notice — his fifth so far — with the recent adoption by the Canadian Parliament of its own version of the Magnitsky Act. As his advocacy has notched up successes, he said, the Russian government has retaliated by declaring him wanted as an international fugitive. Mostly, police forces have ignored the notices, but the listings identifying Mr. Browder, a the hedge fund manager, as a dangerous criminal have for years posed an enormous headache for travel. They can trigger automated alerts at airports and in computer systems that issue visas. Although born in the United States, Mr. Browder renounced his United States citizenship and is now a citizen of Britain. He has traveled to the United States under an expedited visa available to British citizens known as an ESTA, the status that was canceled after Russia posted the latest Interpol notice. “I’m giving the U.S. government the benefit of the doubt,” that it was a bureaucratic or technical matter, Mr. Browder said before his ESTA visa was restored. “It’s still pretty horrible that Vladimir Putin puts out an abusive Interpol arrest warrant, and it has the consequence of banning me from traveling to America.” On the defensive, Russia has repeatedly sought to turn the tables on Mr. Browder by blaming him and Mr. Magnitsky for the drama that unfolded. A court pursued a rare legal action against Mr. Magnitsky posthumously, convicting the dead man of tax evasion and with him Mr. Browder, who was living in London at the time. Mr. Browder was sentenced in absentia to nine years in prison, while Mr. Magnitsky’s punishment was deemed a moot matter. The case was seen as a means for the Russian government to reinforce the narrative that Mr. Browder and Mr. Magnitsky, and not Russian officials, had carried out the tax fraud – and as a justification for repeatedly posting Mr. Browder’s name on Interpol wanted lists.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Economy’s 3% Spurt Emboldens Tax Cut Supporters (and Critics),"The United States economy is showing increased signs of resilience. The nation’s gross domestic product, a key indicator of economic strength, expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. The expansion defied concerns that hurricanes in Texas and Florida would put a damper on output. Republicans called the report a sign that businesses were already spending more in anticipation of a corporate tax cut, and evidence that the economy could grow faster over the long term than currently forecast. “If you look at the G.D.P. data, it’s clear that is a major reason,” Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, asserted on Friday. Many economists, however, are reluctant to give Congress or the administration too much credit for the economy’s trajectory. “There hasn’t been anything concrete in terms of spending or tax cuts that we can point to that’s fueling the acceleration,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. If anyone deserves credit for the good news, he said, it is the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. The economy is experiencing its fastest growth spurt in two consecutive quarters since 2014, after hitting 3.1 percent in the spring, a level that prompted President Trump to suggest that “we’re really on our way” to sustaining that pace year-round. “On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent,” Mr. Trump said during a speech in Missouri in August. But economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent. The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent. With legislation embodying the party’s tax proposals expected next week, the figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their policy: They are celebrating faster growth while arguing that tax reform is needed to accelerate it further. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that “our economy produced solid growth last quarter” and went on to say that tax reform was a way to “continue this growth” and “reinvigorate America’s economy.” On Friday, Mr. Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers released projections of how one prospective provision of the tax plan — a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent — would affect economic growth. They said it would expand output by 3 to 5 percent over the long run, a period left unspecified. The complication is that faster growth could undermine the party’s case that tax cuts are needed to add fuel to an economy that is already running with low unemployment — and it could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly, which could dampen the effects of any tax bill. Liberal economists said the report showed the success of Ms. Yellen at the Fed and undermined the case for the Republican tax bill. “The underlying trend in G.D.P. growth is clearly telling us two things,” Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email. “Keep on rockin’ steady with Yellen at the Fed, and there’s no need for a big, wasteful tax cut.” The Fed, judging that the economy is growing about as fast as it can, is on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December to a level Fed officials have described as likely neither to encourage nor to discourage growth. The Fed’s plans do not reflect the potential economic impact of a tax cut. Aside from the details of the legislation, the Fed’s reaction may also depend on its leadership. Mr. Trump is expected to announce next week whom he will nominate to lead the Fed after Ms. Yellen’s term ends in early February. The growth figure released on Friday was the government’s first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice. Economists initially expected that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma would deal a blow to the country’s steady growth — a prospect reinforced by a net job loss in September — but became more optimistic in recent weeks. After the shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output. After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year. “If you don’t go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. “If you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy.” The destruction wrought by the storms was outweighed by the continued spending of consumers and businesses. The job market is lively, and the stock market has rallied to record highs. Chief executives and consumers are more confident than they have been in more than a decade, recent surveys show. “There are no real headwinds to growth for the first time since the expansion began,” said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “We are at full employment and we are in full swing; let the good times roll.” Spending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements. One reason companies may be investing more in their business is that the labor market has tightened and wages are rising. “Businesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies,” said Mr. Anderson of Bank of the West. Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust 3.9 percent. Mr. Zandi said the numbers were “a sign that consumers are hanging tough.” At the same time, with a weak dollar making American goods more competitive abroad, international trade contributed positively to output for the third quarter in a row. Imports decreased. The weak dollar through much of this year has been a boon to exporters like David Ickert, vice president for finance at Air Tractor Inc. The company, which is based in Olney, Tex., a town of about 3,100 people west of Dallas, makes crop dusters and forestry firefighting planes for markets including European countries along the Mediterranean Sea, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Half of its sales are international. “Things are picking up — I sense it in Europe,” Mr. Ickert said. He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filtered down to rural communities. “Trade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business,” he said. The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent. And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year. “This is happening globally,” Mr. Zandi, the Moody’s economist, said. “There isn’t a single major economy that is in recession.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Evacuation Drills in South Korea Heighten Fears of Military Action,"SEOUL, South Korea — The United States military said on Monday that it would practice evacuating noncombatant Americans out of South Korea in the event of war and other emergencies, as the two allies began a joint naval exercise amid heightened tensions with North Korea. It has conducted similar evacuation exercises for decades. But with fears rising in the South that the United States might be preparing for military action against the North, the American military issued a rare news release on Monday stressing that the noncombatant evacuation exercise was a “routinely scheduled” drill. The drill, known as Courageous Channel, is scheduled from next Monday through Friday and is aimed at preparing American “service members and their families to respond to a wide range of crisis management events such as noncombatant evacuation and natural or man-made disasters,” the United States military said in a statement. The South Korean government of President Moon Jae-in has repeatedly warned that it opposes a military solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis because it could quickly escalate into a full-blown war in which Koreans would suffer the most. United States officials said they were hoping for a diplomatic end to the crisis, but would not rule out military action. And in recent months, as North Korea has accelerated its nuclear and missile programs, President Trump has issued a series of comments that have stoked fears among South Koreans of possible war on the Korean Peninsula. He has threatened to “totally destroy” or rain down “fire and fury” on the North, and has also said that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with the country. North Korea has matched Mr. Trump’s tough talk by calling the American leader a “mentally deranged dotard” and threatening to launch missiles around Guam, an American territory in the Western Pacific, and shoot down long-range bombers taking off from the island for exercises near Korea. The United States military did not disclose how many people would participate in the evacuation drill next week. But it said the scale and focus would not vary from past versions. “Nonparticipants across the peninsula can expect little to no disruption of daily activities on and around military installations,” it said. Participants in the exercise receive briefings on evacuation procedures and “limited rehearsals,” it said. Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, the commander of United States Forces Korea, said, “Although not directly tied to current geopolitical events, our forces must be ready in all areas.” “This training is as important to readiness as our other routine events such as tank gunnery and fighter wing exercises,” he said. Also on Monday, the United States and South Korea started a 10-day joint naval exercise in waters east and west of the Korean Peninsula. The American aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan is joining the annual drill, as are American and South Korean warplanes. The nuclear-powered submarine Michigan arrived at the South Korean port of Busan on Friday to join the naval exercise. North Korea considers joint military drills by the United States and South Korea rehearsals for invasion. On Friday, its officials renewed their threats to launch missiles into the waters around Guam, home to major American military bases from which the United States would send major reinforcements should war break out on the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Tillerson said on Sunday that his diplomatic efforts would continue even though Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, have been exchanging threats and personal insults. “Those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops,” Mr. Tillerson said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Despite Mr. Trump’s rebuffing of Mr. Tillerson’s diplomatic efforts, the secretary of state said that the president preferred making diplomacy a priority as an option to tame the North’s nuclear ambitions. “The president has also made clear to me that he wants this solved diplomatically,” Mr. Tillerson said. “He is not seeking to go to war.” In Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia approved a package of sanctions against North Korea, fulfilling provisions of a United Nations resolution passed in November 2016 in response to the North’s nuclear program. According to the document, published on Monday, Russia banned imports of zinc, silver, copper and nickel from North Korea, as well as exports of helicopters and vessels. It also suspended scientific and technical cooperation with the country. The document also bans exports of luxury products to North Korea, such as carpets worth more than $500 and china worth more than $100. It also included a list of people and companies that were barred from having financial transactions with Russian entities. An earlier version of a headline with this article on the mobile edition of The New York Times misstated the timing of the drills. They are scheduled from Oct. 23 to 27; they have not yet begun.",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Expels 15 Cuban Diplomats, in Latest Sign Détente May Be Ending","WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, escalating his response to a mysterious affliction that has stricken American Embassy personnel in Havana in a move that cast a Cold War chill over relations between the two countries. The order to the diplomats to leave the United States constituted the latest in a series of actions by Mr. Trump to unwind the détente between the United States and Cuba undertaken by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama sought to end the hostility and mistrust that had characterized the relationship between the two countries for more than a half-century, and regarded the resumption in relations as one of his foreign policy legacies. The Cuban government condemned what it called a “hasty, inappropriate and unthinking” decision motivated by politics, and warned that the diplomatic dispute would sour relations already imperiled by Mr. Trump’s move to crack down on travel and commerce with the island nation. The State Department said the expulsion of the diplomats was intended to force Cuba to place its embassy in Washington, where the diplomats were stationed, on the same emergency status that the United States is now operating under in Havana after it decided last week to pare its staff there down to a skeletal group of just 27 people. Still, taken together with a policy directive that Mr. Trump issued in June and a State Department warning last week admonishing Americans not to travel to the island nation, the embassy drawdowns have the potential to freeze the normalization process in its tracks. They make it more difficult for citizens of both countries to engage with each other, imperiling already narrow channels of trade and commerce that opened after the 2014 rapprochement, and all but shutting down the immigration pipeline that allows Cubans to reunite with their families on American soil. A State Department official said the action did not signal a change in policy or an official determination that Cuba was responsible for the illnesses, which have confounded American investigators trying to locate their cause. But the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, said the Cuban government had not done enough to protect Americans on its soil, and would need to ensure that the illnesses would not continue before personnel in either embassy could return. American diplomats and their spouses began reporting symptoms that included hearing loss, dizziness, balance and visual problems, headaches and cognitive issues last December. By late January, the State Department realized that the illnesses were related and might have resulted from some sort of attack, perhaps by a sonic device, toxin or virus. The number of personnel thought to have been affected has gradually grown over the months, and on Tuesday the State Department added one more to the list, bringing it to 22. In a statement, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the United States was expelling the Cuban diplomats “due to Cuba’s failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention.” Mr. Tillerson added that “this order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations.” In a briefing with reporters Tuesday morning, a State Department official said the Cuban ambassador in Washington was informed of the expulsions in a 9 a.m. phone call from Francisco Palmieri, the top State Department official for the Western Hemisphere. The expelled embassy personnel were given seven days to leave the United States. The American Embassy in Havana will have completed its own drawdown by Friday. “We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba,” Mr. Tillerson said, “and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks.” The Cuban government accused the Trump administration of using the health crisis as an excuse to drive out Cuban diplomats without any proof that Havana was responsible. At a news conference in Havana, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Cuba’s foreign minister, said the move was “eminently political” as well as “unwarranted and unjustifiable.” Mr. Rodríguez faulted the American government for not reporting the ailments its diplomats suffered earlier to authorities in Cuba. The Cuban government, he said, has been denied access to the affected American personnel and the doctors who treated them, which has stymied Cuba’s ability to help with the investigation. “Cuba has never perpetrated, and will never perpetrate, any type of attacks against diplomats or their relatives — no exception,” Mr. Rodríguez said. Nor, he added, would it allow a third party to do so. He dismissed accounts of hearing loss and other symptoms as “science fiction.” Daniel Erikson, who as a White House and State Department adviser on Latin America during the Obama administration was deeply involved in the 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, said the severe cutback in diplomats in Havana could blind the United States during Cuba’s crucial political transition next year, when President Raúl Castro is expected to retire and a new generation of leaders take over. “It looks like what began as a legitimate effort to protect American diplomats from harm is moving to a broader breakdown in U.S.-Cuban relations,” Mr. Erikson said. The expulsions were cheered by opponents of the normalization, including members of the Cuban exile community, historically hostile to a Castro government, and condemned by supporters of warmer relations between Cuba and the United States, who said the move threatened to create a new chapter of hostility and play into the hands of those who wish to drive the two countries apart. It would be especially damaging, proponents of engagement argued, if — as many current and former officials suspect — the Cuban government is not behind the attacks. “If this is not the government, but rather other forces seeking to undermine the U.S.-Cuba relationship, a permanent downgrade would accomplish that objective for them,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the former Obama administration deputy national security adviser who helped to negotiate the move toward normalization. But Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a leading foe of closer relations between the two countries, said the expulsions were a fitting response to Cuba’s misbehavior. He and other Republicans had called on Mr. Tillerson in a letter last month to go a step further, declaring all Cuban diplomats in the United States “persona non grata,” a dramatic diplomatic stigma that results in banishment with no right to return. “The idea that over 20 American Embassy personnel could be severely injured in Cuba & the Cuban govt. not know about it is ridiculous,” Mr. Rubio wrote Tuesday on Twitter. Some of those who were affected reported hearing odd sounds in particular rooms of their homes, leading some experts to speculate that some kind of sonic weapon or faulty surveillance device may have been at fault. F.B.I. agents investigating in Cuba have not been able to find the causes of the ailments. With little hard evidence in hand, former American officials who follow Cuba closely have entertained a handful of theories that involve a third country, such as Russia — which would have an interest in driving a wedge between Cuba and the United States as the election approaches — or North Korea, which has en embassy in Havana. Neither scenario seems plausible without some level of Cuban government complicity, these officials say, considering how rigorously Cuba’s intelligence service tracks diplomats on the island. The administration expelled two low-level Cuban diplomats in May in response to the illnesses, but with more diplomats and their spouses becoming ill, calls grew on Capitol Hill for a more forceful response. In the meantime, Mr. Trump in June announced he was “canceling the last administration’s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,” although the stricter travel and commercial regulations he ordered would fall well short of doing so, and have yet to materialize. Career American diplomats leaving Havana expressed regret on Tuesday that their missions were coming to an end. “I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,” Scott Hamilton, the top American official in Cuba, wrote on Facebook. “Hasta la próxima, Cuba.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Halt in Visa Services Leaves Cuban Families in Limbo,"Cubans have long regarded emigrating to the United States as something of a birthright derived from the privations they endured as a result of sanctions that Washington has imposed on Cuba for decades. Last week, for the first time in decades, the United States effectively shut down the immigration pipeline from the island as it sharply reduced its staff at the embassy in Havana in response to mysterious ailments there, leaving in limbo more than 100,000 Cubans, most of whom are seeking to reunite with relatives. The decision to indefinitely suspend visa processing at the embassy — one of the busiest consular posts in the region — could mean that the United States will fail to honor its obligations under a 1994 deal that requires the admission of at least 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year, current and former American diplomats say. The accord was reached in an effort to stem an exodus by Cubans who took to the seas in rafts by the thousands in the 1990s trying to reach Florida. The halt in visa services comes roughly nine months after Washington ended its “wet foot, dry foot” policy. That policy, which required Cubans caught trying to reach the United States by sea to return home but allowed those who make it onto American soil to stay, had in recent years enabled an additional tens of thousands of Cubans to move to the United States. The sudden suspension of legal pathways for Cubans to settle in the United States could set off a new migration surge, experts in both countries said, particularly if Cuba experiences an economic downturn. “It doesn’t give them an escape,” said Vicki Huddleston, a Cuba expert who ran the United States diplomatic mission in Havana from 1999 to 2002. “I think it risks another massive migration. You have folks who really want to leave, and at least that was a possibility while we were issuing immigrant visas.” As of November 2016, there were 106,351 Cubans awaiting immigrant visas, according to the State Department, which did not respond to questions about how it intended to address this caseload given the reduced staffing level in Havana. Cuban Americans and their relatives on the island, many of whom have spent years waiting for visa interview appointments, were despondent after learning that consular services in Havana had been suspended. Irene Hierrezuelo, 50, had been so anxious in recent weeks about her Oct. 2 appointment at the embassy that she barely slept at night and took pills to steady her nerves. She was counting the days to be reunited with her daughter, Sulay Falconet, 30, who moved to Houston in 2012, and to embrace her 3-year-old grandson, Jeremy. The yearning to be reunited became unbearable, she said, after Ms. Falconet’s home was flooded last month when Hurricane Harvey battered Houston. “I feel so powerless,” Ms. Hierrezuelo said in a telephone interview over the weekend, breaking into sobs. “The only thing I have in life is my daughter and my grandson.” Ms. Falconet, who works at a car dealership in Houston, said she had been looking forward to holidays and birthdays once again being joyous events rather than reminders of her mother’s solitude. “To be honest, I’m very afraid,” she said. “No one gives you answers.” The news also devastated Carmen Miranda, a doctor who secured a United States visa in 2015 after defecting from a medical mission run by the Cuban government in Brazil. Ms. Miranda, 50, was allowed to sponsor her husband and younger daughter for visas at the American consulate in Rio de Janeiro. But her older daughter, Mariela Quiñones, had to return to Havana and wait a few years to join the family, because new American immigrants can simultaneously sponsor only children who are under 21. Ms. Quiñones was 23 when her parents and sister moved to Miami. “I don’t want to spend another birthday without you guys,” Ms. Quiñones told her mother in a text message over the weekend. “My 26th I’m already going to spend without you, but I don’t want to spend my 27th.” Ms. Miranda, a social worker who takes care of elderly people in Miami, sought to cheer up her daughter. “Sweetie, I don’t know about this one, but your next birthday we’ll spend sailing on a cruise or at Disney,” Ms. Miranda texted back. “You have to trust and think positive and you’ll see at any moment we’ll get the surprise.” Yet Ms. Miranda said the surprise they had long yearned for now felt more like holding out for a miracle. Before last week, she would call a phone number for visa inquiries each week for updates on her daughter’s petition. Officials kept telling her they were still processing cases filed in 2010, but while Ms. Quiñones was nowhere near the front of the line, at least the family knew the pipeline was flowing. “I can’t get over this,” Ms. Miranda said. “Imagine the pain a mother feels when she longs for a child.” Juan Manuel Iglesias, 53, can relate. A Miami welder who has lived in the United States since 1997, he has spent four years trying to get a visa for his wife, Tania González Sánchez, 46, an optometrist from the central Cuban city of Cienfuegos. Immigration officials requested more evidence about the relationship after Ms. González had a visa interview in May 2015, but the couple has yet to hear back. “It’s been hard for both of us,” Mr. Iglesias said. “She always has doubts about whether I have another woman here. But we’ve stayed together because we’re in love.” The State Department has said that Cubans may apply for temporary visas, such as those issued to students and tourists, at other embassies. But it has offered no guidance to applicants for immigrant visas, which are generally issued in a person’s country of origin or residence. Bruno Rodríguez, Cuba’s foreign minister, said on Tuesday that the Cuban Embassy in Washington would also struggle to provide consular services to its citizens as a result of the State Department’s expulsion of 15 Cuban diplomats. The new staffing levels at the embassies in Washington and Havana, Mr. Rodríguez said, will leave each consular section staffed by just one officer. Carlos Alzugaray, a scholar and former Cuban diplomat who lives in Havana, said the Trump administration’s decisions threatened to derail the good will and trust that the Cold War antagonists had begun to rebuild since diplomatic relations were restored in late 2014. “It affects academic, cultural, educational and environmental exchanges,” Mr. Alzugaray said. “It’s like a furtive rupture in relations without closing embassies.” Ms. González lamented the effects that the latest geopolitical twist is having on people’s personal lives. “Those are problems between countries and governments that should not interfere in our marriage,” she said. “And yet the days pass and I don’t see a way to be reunited with my husband.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Helicopter Crashes on Okinawa, Adding to Safety Concerns","TOKYO — A transport helicopter made an emergency landing after catching fire on Wednesday in a United States military training area on the northern part of Okinawa in Japan, stirring concerns about the deployment of the craft near civilian areas. In a statement, the Third Marine Expeditionary Force said that the helicopter had been taking part in a routine training and that none of the crew members or any civilians were injured. According to the Japanese Defense Ministry, the helicopter, a CH-53, made its landing in the Takae district of Higashi village, where the Japanese government has been building helicopter landing pads for the American military, a project that a small but fierce group of residents have been protesting for years. NHK, the public broadcaster, quoted the United States military as saying the helicopter had been stationed at the Futenma air base on Okinawa. Itsunori Onodera, Japan’s defense minister, told reporters that the government was investigating whether any civilians had been hurt. Mr. Onodera said that Japan had asked the United States to “immediately investigate the cause, prevent a recurrence, thoroughly implement safety controls, and supply detailed information.” Mr. Onodera added that the government was concerned by a recent spate of safety problems. Last month, two MV-22 Osprey, a hybrid aircraft, were forced to make emergency landings at Ishigaki airport on Okinawa. The Marine Corps also said last month that a crash of an Osprey off the coast of Okinawa last December was caused by pilot error. The U.S. Marines said that it was investigating the cause of the accident but that “there is limited information at this time.” Protesters in Takae have complained that the helicopter landing pads would lead to increased noise and possibly accidents. Speaking to a reporter on NHK, Kumiko Nakamine, district leader of Takae, said she had seen black smoke and flames billowing from the road near a residential area. “I’m surprised that what we had been concerned about actually happened,” Ms. Nakamine said. “I want the helipads to be removed.” Masatsugu Isa, a village assemblyman who saw the flames from the crash, said that it appeared as if the helicopter had been conducting a drill. “It again confirmed Ospreys are not the only danger,” said Mr. Isa, in a telephone interview. “This training site must be removed immediately. U.S. forces are not serious enough. They are not properly maintaining their aircraft.” The crash occurred on the same day that a Japanese court ordered the central government to pay damages of 610 million yen ($5.4 million) to about 1,000 residents who had sued because of excessive aircraft noise from the United States’ Yokota Air Base, about 28 miles from Tokyo.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Hospitals Wrestle With Shortages of Drug Supplies Made in Puerto Rico,"One of the workhorses of Clarke County Hospital, a 25-bed facility in rural Osceola, Iowa, is an unassuming product known as a Mini-Bag. It is a small, fluid-filled bag used by nurses to dilute drugs, like antibiotics, so that they can be dripped slowly into patients’ veins. The bag’s ease of use has made it popular in small facilities like Clarke County, where the pharmacy is closed on nights and weekends, as well as at nationally known hospitals like the Cleveland Clinic, which uses 34,000 of the bags every month. “It’s a safe, sterile, stable way to get medications to patients,” said Michele Evink, the pharmacy manager at Clarke County Hospital. Now, hospital pharmacists across the country are racing to find alternatives — which themselves are becoming scarce — after Hurricane Maria halted production at the factory in Puerto Rico where Baxter, the manufacturer, makes the product. The bag shortage is the most significant to be directly linked to the effects of the hurricane but others are likely to follow. In addition to creating a humanitarian crisis on the island, the storm knocked out production at the Puerto Rican factories that make vital drugs, medical devices and medical supplies that are used around the world. Some device and supply companies have already begun limiting shipments of certain items from the island, ranging from mesh for repairing hernias to surgical scalpels and tools used in orthopedic surgery. On Monday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, questioned companies’ statements that their plants were back in operation: “We understand that manufacturing is running at minimal levels, and certainly far from full production,” Dr. Gottlieb said in prepared remarks published Monday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is scheduled to be questioned by the committee on Tuesday. In his prepared statement, Dr. Gottlieb said many plants are running at below 50 percent capacity, “with many firms operating around 20 percent capacity, and some even less. We have found no firm operating above 70 percent of their normal operation.” In a recent interview, Dr. Gottlieb said he was worried that if conditions don’t improve, more shortages — of both drugs and medical devices — might follow by early next year. Pharmaceutical products made in Puerto Rico account for nearly 10 percent of all drugs consumed by Americans, and about 80 firms make medical products there, the F.D.A. has said. “I don’t think we’ve dealt with a situation where we’ve had so many simultaneous impacts to what are very important facilities,” Dr. Gottlieb said. So far, “we have been able to mitigate these issues, but it’s been all hands on deck at the F.D.A., and there’s been close calls.” Dr. Gottlieb says the F.D.A. is watching the supply of about 30 drugs that are made on the island, in addition to medical devices. Most companies are still running on diesel generators, and manufacturers that have been able to connect to the power grid are still encountering an unpredictable supply of electricity, he said. Cathy Denning, the senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals, said several device manufacturers, including Medtronic, which makes surgical staples, and Stryker, which makes orthopedic surgery products, were shipping reduced supplies of some products to hospitals because of Hurricane Maria. “We here at Vizient had an ‘aha’ moment when we realized how much manufacturing actually takes place in Puerto Rico,” she said. Last week, a Johnson & Johnson executive told investors that the company couldn’t rule out “intermittent” shortages of some formulations of its products, although he noted that many were made elsewhere. Johnson & Johnson makes Tylenol and the H.I.V. drug Prezista in Puerto Rico, as well as other products. Soon after the storm, Johnson & Johnson Vision informed customers that a product used in cataract surgery might go into short supply, according to Vizient. A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said production of the product has resumed, but that it has not yet been shipped from Puerto Rico. The F.D.A. has been supplying logistical help to companies, providing fuel for the generators and assisting with moving finished products off the island. Dr. Gottlieb said some companies had gotten down to a 24-hour supply of diesel fuel, and representatives for the medical-device industry had said some generators were beginning to break down, requiring emergency repair. Pharmacists at half a dozen hospitals, from Utah to North Carolina, said in interviews that the fluid bag shortage had had a domino effect, leading to scarcities of a range of products as administrators race to stock up on the supplies they need to keep their hospitals running smoothly. Even products like empty bags and plastic tubing, which are also made by Baxter in Puerto Rico, have been hard to come by, some said. “With drug shortages, it is often a race to see who can find a supply of the drug on shortage and also any alternatives,” said Philip J. Trapskin, who is the program manager of medication use strategy and innovation at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s health system. “We have been able to get what we need to avoid disruptions in patient care, but the mix of products is not ideal and there are no guarantees we will continue to get the supplies we need.” Baxter recently announced that the F.D.A. had allowed it to import bags from the company’s factories in Ireland and Australia, and said production in Puerto Rico was slowly resuming. The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was also helping its employees on the island, including distributing generators and propane-powered cooktops for the workers’ use. “While the storm devastated the island in a day, the recovery will take time,” the company said in a statement. Baxter did not provide a timeline for when the bags would be back in stock, and pharmacists said they anticipated that the bags might not be available for many more weeks or months. “This is a big deal for hospitals across the country,” said Scott Knoer, the chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic. “We’re really still trying to get the information we need to manage it.” Baxter has been rationing its supply, shipping limited orders of the bags filled with saline and dextrose to hospitals based on a percentage of what the institutions typically use. “We are getting small amounts, but it is nowhere what we need in order to take care of patients,” said Jeff Rosner, who oversees pharmacy contracting and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic. The impact has rippled throughout the clinic’s normal operations. Alternatives, such as injecting some drugs into an IV — known as an “IV push” — take more time for nurses, which divert them from attending to other needs. And the method is not appropriate for some drugs. “This has repercussions,” Mr. Knoer said. The pharmacists said the shortage had not yet affected patient care, although some of the alternatives require that employees learn new systems or adopt complex practices that can introduce human error. If the shortage persists, some said elective procedures, like knee replacements, might be postponed. It is a predicament that is all too familiar. While Hurricane Maria caused the latest problem, drug shortages have plagued the nation’s hospital system for years. The affected products are typically longstanding staples, like epinephrine or morphine, and are often sterile injectable drugs that sell for low profit margins. In 2014, a shortage of large saline bags, which were manufactured by Baxter and are not currently scarce, led to state and federal investigations into its business practices. Even the Mini-Bags have previously been in short supply, and pharmacists said shipments of the small bags had been unpredictable before the hurricane. “It’s like, do we have any great faith this company is going to be able to turn this shortage around, when they haven’t been able to effectively turn around the shortages they had in existence before?” said Debby Cowan, the pharmacy manager at Angel Medical Center, a small hospital in Franklin, in North Carolina’s Smoky Mountains. Like Dr. Gottlieb, many of the hospital administrators said their eye was on the horizon. With so many drug companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosner said, “I am fearful that this may not be the end of the shortages — it may only be the beginning.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Investor Tries to Shake Up Sina, a Pillar of China’s Internet","HONG KONG — The Chinese internet boom has been good to Sina. Maybe, protests one of its American investors, it could have been better. The New York-traded shares of Sina, whose Weibo service is one of China’s most popular social media platforms, have been on a tear. They have been lifted by the same surge that has put Chinese companies like the Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings among the ranks of Amazon and Facebook in terms of stock market value. Still, Sina finds itself embroiled in an unusual situation for a company with a surging stock price: a proxy fight. Aristeia Capital, a hedge fund based in Connecticut, is lobbying Sina shareholders to back its two candidates for the company’s board in a bid to shake up Sina’s business and give shareholders fatter returns. This week, the other shareholders will weigh in, casting their votes before a shareholder meeting set for Friday. Proxy fights in general are not uncommon, but one between a Chinese company and an American investor is the first of its kind, according to disclosures tracked by the data provider FactSet. And the campaign has helped to underscore the limits of foreign ownership of Chinese internet companies. Sina, one of the first Chinese tech companies to list its shares in New York, has called Aristeia “self-serving” and naïve about how China’s internet sector works. In turn, Aristeia, which manages $3 billion in investor money, has accused Sina of “failing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.” Foreign investors seem less than worried about any lack of control or lapses in corporate governance if the market is any indication. Shares in those companies have been on a tear in markets around the world as Chinese consumers reliably use their smartphones to buy electronics, shop for groceries, make investments, play games and look for dates. With more than 700 million users, China is the world’s largest single internet market. Weibo has 313 million monthly average users. Still, some investors are quietly complaining about corporate governance practices. Chinese companies that list shares in the United States are not necessarily subject to American rules. Most are incorporated in light regulatory jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands. As a result, Chinese companies often behave differently. While Sina holds a regular annual meeting, some of its peers do not, a standard for the United States. Baidu, the search engine giant, has not held an annual shareholder meeting since 2008. JD.com, the online retailer, has never held one. “Investors have been getting a bit fed up with companies like Baidu and JD.com not having general meetings,” said Jamie Allen, the secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. A spokesman for JD.com said: “Investors appreciate our candor both on earnings calls and in engagement throughout the year. This issue has rarely, if ever, been raised to us.” Baidu did not respond to requests for comment. Foreign investors also typically have fewer shareholder protections. To get around Chinese restrictions on outside investments in sensitive industries, many companies use a complicated legal structure, called a variable interest entity, or V.I.E. Under those arrangements, shareholders have rights to the profits of a company, but they do not control key assets — potentially leaving them exposed if the company runs into trouble or the Chinese government declares the structure illegal. Sina was a key player in the Chinese internet’s emergence as a social and economic force. Its Weibo service, once derided by critics as a knockoff of Twitter, has grown in size and functionality to the point where it is now a must-read for many people. Even after the Chinese government curbed political or controversial discussion on Weibo, it remains a well-read resource. Weibo now has its own stock listing, while Sina owns a 46 percent stake. Sina’s other operations include online news and entertainment. That separate listing helped set off the fight with Aristeia. Sina’s shares have risen nearly 75 percent so far this year. But Weibo’s performance has been better, with the stock more than doubling. Based on their stock market values, Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina — a gap that Aristeia says points to lackluster management and poor corporate governance. Sina uses a V.I.E. structure. Only one of the five director seats is available each year. The chairman and chief executive, Charles Chao, has a permanent position; the other members serve four-year terms. Aristeia is pushing for representation on the board so that directors will consider measures that would result in more money for shareholders. These include a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo or a buyback of shares by management. Sina says that any deal proposed by Aristeia would not clear because of China’s complicated telecom and media rules. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, also owns a stake in Weibo, further complicating its options, Sina said. “The time, resources and capital invested to pursue a transaction with a high likelihood of failure, rather than accretive and value creating opportunities, is not in the best interests of Sina shareholders,” Sina said in a statement. Some outsiders disagree. “I think Sina has built in Weibo a very valuable asset that is not being reflected in its share price,” said Randy Gelber, a managing director at UBS, the Swiss bank. “It would seem like there should be some common ground from both sides on how to realize that value,” he said. Two proxy advisers — Glass Lewis & Company and International Shareholder Services — have given some weight to Aristeia’s arguments. Glass Lewis recommended that Sina expand its board to allow Aristeia’s nominees, and I.S.S. recommended that Sina shareholders support one of the two nominees. “An examination of the arguments reveals compelling reasons for shareholders to seek change at the company,” I.S.S. said. The fight is being watched closely at a time when American activists are bringing their bare-knuckled approach to Asia. Daniel S. Loeb, one of the most vocal activists, scored a victory in a campaign for change at the Japanese conglomerate that owns the 7-Eleven convenience store chain last year. In South Korea, the activist Paul Singer and his hedge fund firm, Elliott Management, picked fights with Samsung Electronics and the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong. It is also unfolding as the Chinese government looks to take a more active role in how its corporate giants are managed. Even if Aristeia emerges victorious, the real test could be whether its candidates will be able to push for change internally. “The question is whether that board member would be able to do anything other than jump up and down at meetings,” said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management. video",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Lost 33,000 Jobs in September; Unemployment Rate Dips to 4.2%","Staggering from the impact of hurricanes that walloped Texas, Florida and neighboring states, the economy lost 33,000 jobs in September, the first monthly decline in employment in seven years, the government reported on Friday. But economists discounted the discouraging report, describing it as a blip in a job market that was fundamentally strong. Some of the good news released by the Labor Department — a drop in the jobless rate to 4.2 percent and a year-over-year gain in wage growth of 2.9 percent — may also have been skewed by weather disruptions. “The numbers were certainly blown around a lot by the storms,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust. For that reason, he said, the Federal Reserve, which has been scrutinizing the employment report for signs of inflation, will probably look past this report. “As winds calm,” he said, “my guess is employment figures will stabilize.” That pattern held true for Bruce Gropper, who runs Right at Home, a home-care franchise in Palm Beach, Fla. “We put our hiring on hold” because of the weather, Mr. Gropper said, adding that many of the 50 to 75 caregivers who work for him and would typically have been in the field were unable or unavailable to work during a two-week period. “Now, things are back to normal.” It was the same in Texas. “There’s a lot of manufacturing jobs in Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Houston, all of which suffered damage,” noted Ray Perryman, president of the Perryman Group, an economic research and analysis firm based in Waco, Tex. “Some of these plants were shut down for an extended period of time, and that would have gotten into the September survey.” One upside may be a surge in hiring in subsequent months. Using Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 as a benchmark, Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said he expected payrolls to bounce back by the end of the year. “There’s no question there were huge hurricane effects,” he said. Food and drinking establishments alone lost 105,000 jobs last month, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of people who said they were not working because of bad weather jumped by 1.5 million. Mr. O’Sullivan and several economists agreed that the labor market was still pushing ahead — no matter how unevenly — in what is now the ninth year of an economic expansion. “The other data we’ve been seeing this week don’t show any signs of a weaker trend,” Mr. O’Sullivan said. “If you take out Texas and Florida, there’s been no increase in jobless claims over the past five weeks.” The stock market’s reaction to the news was mildly negative. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined slightly from record levels after eight straight days of gains. President Trump called attention this week to the economy’s successes, writing on Twitter on Thursday, “Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years!” Last week, Mr. Trump said that the Republicans’ proposed tax cuts would provide further “rocket fuel for our economy.” Many workers have been waiting to see concrete evidence of economic progress in their paychecks. Although the Census Bureau last month reported a jump in annual incomes across a wide spectrum, households with incomes below the median remain worse off than they were in 2000. The hefty growth in average wages reported on Friday was probably exaggerated, because many low-wage workers were temporarily displaced by the storms, bumping up the overall average. At least a portion of the 0.5 percent average hourly wage growth last month, though, is likely to stick. There is plenty of evidence that broad swaths of the labor market are tightening. Target said last month that it would increase its base hourly pay by $1, to $11 — higher than or equal to the minimum wage in every state. Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing, said that employers she worked with were raising wages and reaching into less-common pools of potential employees like retirees, stay-at-home moms and people with disabilities. Ms. Glaser said she expected wages to rise further, saying some of her clients were thinking about increasing hourly wages as much as 20 to 40 percent during the peak holiday season and early next year. Employers are also pushing to retain the workers they have — for example, by offering more bonuses for e-commerce and other seasonal workers who stay through the holidays. Some businesses are trying to generate and educate their work forces by offering more paid internships and apprenticeships. Others are shortening the interview cycle to improve their chances. “There is a need for speed,” Ms. Glaser said. “Whoever gets to a candidate first is well positioned.” Radial, the second-largest direct-to-consumer e-commerce company behind Amazon, is hiring 27,000 people to work in its 25 warehouses around the country through mid-January. Even as brick-and-mortar retail is suffering significant losses, e-commerce continues to thrive. “We’re hiring 35 percent, or 7,000, more people than we did last year,” said Stefan Weitz, Radial’s executive vice president for technology services. “It’s very competitive. A lot of logistics companies have operations in similar areas because of the proximity to air and ground transport.” At the upper end of the labor market, the competition for highly skilled workers is intense. Bryan Leach, founder of Ibotta, a Denver company offering a mobile shopping app, said he had hired more than 100 people this year, including engineers, product managers and data scientists, mostly at six-figure salaries. “We are hiring national search firms to shop for talent in the coasts,” in addition to seven in-house recruiters, Mr. Leach said. The company has also helped sponsor billboards in San Francisco promoting the benefits of living in Denver and is offering $1,000 apiece to employees who refer friends who are hired. Despite the scramble for workers, the labor market has stubborn weak spots. Many of the jobs available, like the seasonal positions at Radial, are at the lower end of the pay scale and do not offer long-term stability. For some workers, such jobs have limited appeal. The labor force participation rate peaked its head above 63 percent in September, but many workers remain on the sidelines. Revised hiring figures for July and August showed that a total of 38,000 fewer jobs were created in those two months than previously reported, bringing the monthly average gain in 2017 — excluding September — to 170,000. August’s figures will be revised one more time, while September’s will be revised twice over the next two months. State-by-state tallies for September are not yet available. (Although Hurricane Maria also devastated Puerto Rico in September, the survey of employers that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to calculate monthly payroll gains does not include the island.) The Katrina experience showed that hiring can rebound quickly after a disaster, as damaged communities clean up and rebuild. Employment gains averaged 249,000 in the six months before the storm. After New Orleans found itself underwater, gains averaged 76,000 over the next couple of months before soaring to 341,000 in November 2005. While the recovery from the latest storms takes shape, businesses and workers are still counting their losses. Brian Petranick, Right at Home’s president and chief executive, said Palm Beach was not the only community where franchises were unable to connect workers and clients. He estimated hurricane-related losses to the company would end up at $13 million to $15 million. “During big storms, we see a loss of hours and services,” he said. “That means caregivers are losing the opportunity to work and make money.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Must Allow Undocumented 17-Year-Old to Have Abortion, Judge Says","A federal judge on Wednesday ordered top United States government officials to allow a pregnant 17-year-old immigrant to get an abortion — the first ruling in a case that could eventually grow to include hundreds of other undocumented minors who seek access to an abortion while in federal custody. In issuing a temporary restraining order on Wednesday, the United States District Court judge, Tanya S. Chutkan, said the minor, who is in federal custody and is referred to in court documents as Jane Doe, was legally entitled to an abortion and would suffer increased health risks if not given transportation to an abortion facility and access to the procedure. Late Wednesday, the federal government filed a motion asking the United States Court of Appeals to block the judge’s ruling pending an appeal. On Thursday, the ruling was stayed to give the court time to consider the motion. According to a transcript of Wednesday’s court hearing, a lawyer for the federal government argued that because the minor had chosen to remain in the United States, she could “pursue relief through voluntary departure” from the country or choose not to get an abortion. “I am astounded by that position,” Judge Chutkan said. “I have to tell you, I’m astounded that the government is going to make this 17-year-old girl who has received judicial authorization for a medical procedure to which she is constitutionally authorized choose between a pregnancy that she does not want to go forward with to term or returning to the country from which she left.” The American Civil Liberties Union, which asked for the order, has accused federal officials in court documents of leveraging policies they revised in March that have allowed them to block the minor’s access to an abortion by not letting her leave a Texas shelter. A.C.L.U. lawyers say the minor immigrated to the United States without her parents and then was apprehended. “At last, our client will be able to get the care she needs without federal officials standing in the way,” Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney for the A.C.L.U., said in a statement. “Her courage and perseverance are incredible, but no one should have to go to court to get a safe, legal abortion. And no one should be held hostage to the extreme anti-abortion views of a handful of government officials.” Federal officials have argued in court documents that the government had not imposed an “undue burden” on the 17-year-old, but instead “exercised a legitimate choice to refuse to facilitate an abortion.” They say the young woman could request a voluntary departure from the United States, but has not done so. Their supporters have also argued that immigrants who have immigrated illegally with no ties to the country do not have a constitutional right to abortion on demand. In a brief filed in support of the federal officials, eight states — Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Carolina — worried that if the court allowed Jane Doe to have an abortion, “there will be no meaningful limit on the constitutional rights an unlawfully-present alien can invoke simply by trying to enter this country.” In a statement, the Administration for Children and Families at the United States Department of Health and Human Services called the court’s decision “a troubling ruling that exceeds the U.S. Constitution and sets a dangerous precedent by opening our borders to any illegal children seeking taxpayer-supported, elective abortions.” “We are disheartened the ruling rewards ideologically motivated lawsuits filed in multiple courts by the A.C.L.U. and abortion advocates,” the statement said. In a telephone interview, Ms. Amiri said Wednesday’s decision applied only to Jane Doe. However, she said that the A.C.L.U. had filed a motion asking the judge to allow the case to proceed as a class-action lawsuit seeking to prevent the federal government from interfering with access to abortion for people like Jane Doe. She estimated that there might be up to 1,000 unaccompanied, pregnant minors who have immigrated to the United States in federal custody at any given time. The court has yet to rule on that motion, she said. (Pregnant adult women who are caught crossing the border and who seek an abortion are detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has a policy of allowing access, Ms. Amiri said.)",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Must Let Undocumented Teenager Get an Abortion, Appeals Court Says","HOUSTON — She was already nine weeks into her first trimester by the time she learned she was pregnant. And by then, she was already in federal custody at the border in Texas, one of the multitude of unaccompanied minors caught trying to enter the United States without their parents or relatives. She was 17 years old. That simple pregnancy test set off a dramatic legal battle between civil rights lawyers and the Trump administration, after the teenager made it known that she wanted an abortion. Lawyers and advocates for the girl accused federal officials of preventing her from having an abortion and of taking extraordinary steps to persuade her and other undocumented pregnant minors to have their babies. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court in Washington sided with the girl, sending the case back to a lower court, which immediately ordered the Trump administration to allow the girl to obtain an abortion “promptly and without delay.” The ruling may be only one of many legal chapters to come if the Justice Department decides to appeal to the Supreme Court. The case has become a rare intersection of two of the most politically divisive issues in America — illegal immigration and abortion — and has shed light on the role that the federal government and its contractors have played on the border in facilitating and at times trying to block the abortions of undocumented, unaccompanied teenagers. The girl, identified in documents as Jane Doe, remains in custody at a federally-funded shelter in Brownsville, at the tip of South Texas. Nearly 45 years after another Texas woman, known for a time simply as Jane Roe, helped change abortion rights in America in Roe v. Wade — the landmark Supreme Court decision in 1973 that established a Constitutional right to abortion – a Jane Doe has brought a new case that has again polarized the forces for and against abortion. “It is the perfect storm between abortion and immigration, and the Trump administration has shown absolute hostility to both of those issues,” said Brigitte Amiri, the lead lawyer on the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Jane Doe. Devin M. O’Malley, a Justice Department spokesman, said on Tuesday that the agency was reviewing the order and had no immediate comment. Throughout the case, the clock has been ticking: Jane Doe is nearly 16 weeks pregnant and Texas prohibits abortions after 20 weeks, unless a medical emergency exists. That fast pace only accelerated after the decision on Tuesday from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Her lawyers were attempting to get Jane Doe seen on Tuesday by an abortion provider for state-mandated counseling that must be given by the same doctor who will perform the procedure. They said she could undergo an abortion as early as Wednesday. Jane Doe’s lawyers say federal officials had been effectively “holding her hostage” – preventing her from receiving an abortion and requiring her to have a sonogram against her will and to undergo counseling at a religiously affiliated “crisis pregnancy center” that urged her to continue the pregnancy. They also accuse the federal officials responsible for her care of violating a state court’s order. Under Texas law, a minor who wants to end her pregnancy must either obtain her parents’ permission or receive permission from a judge. Jane Doe, with the assistance of Jane’s Due Process, a nonprofit group that provides legal services for pregnant minors, received a judicial order when she was 11 weeks pregnant, meaning that she could undergo an abortion without notifying her parents. But Jane Doe and her lawyers say federal officials violated that order by telling her mother about her pregnancy and plans for an abortion. Jane Doe has told her lawyers that she did not want her parents to know, because they beat an older sister who was pregnant so she would have a miscarriage. Abortion is banned in Jane Doe’s home country in Central America, which has not been identified. Lawyers for the Justice Department have not disputed that Jane Doe has the right to an abortion. But they have argued that the government is not required to facilitate access to abortions, putting the teenager in a precarious position since she is in federal custody. Because Jane Doe chooses to not return to her home country, Justice Department lawyers have effectively argued that she is bringing this ordeal upon herself. Jane Doe “may elect voluntary departure to end her federal custody, which would eliminate the alleged ‘restriction’ or ‘obstacle’ of which she complains,” the Justice Department wrote in court documents. On Oct. 18, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, of the United States District Court in Washington, ordered the government to allow the teenager to get an abortion. But last Friday, a three-judge panel of the appeals court gave federal officials until Oct. 31 to find a sponsor who could take custody of the girl. Undocumented minors are often placed with sponsors while the government considers whether they can stay in the United States permanently, and a sponsor would be able to take the girl to have the abortion without the government “facilitating” it. The A.C.L.U. called it “far-fetched” to expect the government to find and vet a sponsor so quickly. Given the stage of the pregnancy, the A.C.L.U. asked the full appeals court to hear the case. On Tuesday, the full court, in a 6-3 decision, agreed with the A.C.L.U. “Remember, we are talking about a child here,” wrote Judge Patricia Millett, an Obama administration appointee who voted with the majority. “She did everything that Texas law requires to obtain an abortion. That has been undisputed in this case.” In a dissent, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, a George W. Bush appointee, said the sponsor plan might not be ideal, but it was not unconstitutional. “After all, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that the government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of the minor, and not facilitating abortion, so long as the government does not impose an undue burden on the abortion decision,” he wrote. In a separate dissent, Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was appointed by the first President Bush, made an argument the government itself did not make. She wrote that an undocumented minor does not have the same right to an abortion that a citizen has. “Under today’s decision, pregnant alien minors the world around seeking elective abortions will be on notice that they should make the trip” to the United States, she wrote. In a sign of the polarizing nature of the case, eight states with Republican attorneys general, led by Texas, filed a brief supporting the government, while 13 states with Democratic attorneys general, along with the District of Columbia, backed Jane Doe. Unaccompanied pregnant minors have attempted to illegally cross the border for decades, and a number of them have had abortions while in federal custody. But fights over their access to abortions predate the Trump administration. Last year, a federal lawsuit, which is ongoing, faulted the government for placing a number of minors in the care of religiously-affiliated organizations that would not let them obtain abortions and birth control. But A.C.L.U. lawyers said that in March, the Trump administration went further, enacting a policy that requires the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the health department division that oversees the care of unaccompanied minors, to personally approve any abortion. Advocates for abortion rights have accused the director, Scott Lloyd, of pushing anti-abortion beliefs onto the young women in federal custody. In emails that were made public as part of the case filed last year, Mr. Lloyd appears to have personally met with undocumented pregnant teens in shelters and spoken with them about their pregnancies. After traveling to San Antonio in March and visiting with one minor, he wrote to some of his staff that if things “get dicey” with the minor’s adult sponsor, “I know a few good families with a heart for these situations who would take her in in a heartbeat and see her through her pregnancy and beyond.” A spokesman for the health department said Tuesday that the office was deciding whether to respond. In a declaration Jane Doe made earlier this month, she accused federal officials of forcing her to have a baby. “Defendants have been talking to me about my pregnancy – I feel like they are trying to coerce me to carry my pregnancy to term,” she wrote.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. National Team Still Controls Its Own World Cup Destiny,"The easiest route to the World Cup, any national team will tell you, is through the front door. Win your qualifying games and you can’t be left out. No worries. No math. No if-we-do-this-and-they-do-that calculations. Win, and you’re in. This, then, is the most appealing route for the United States national team over the next six days. If Coach Bruce Arena and his players win their final two qualifying games, at home against Panama on Friday and at Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday night, they can pack their bags for Russia 2018. “Easier said than done,” Arena admitted in an otherwise rah-rah letter to fans published by U.S. Soccer this week, “but that’s all there is to it.” The reality, as is often the case, is more complicated. Only three teams from Concacaf, the regional qualifying group that includes the United States, are guaranteed spots in next summer’s World Cup. Mexico already has claimed one of them, and second-place Costa Rica can grab the second with a win or a tie against fifth-place Honduras on Friday. The United States sits fourth in the six-team qualifying group, with 9 points to Panama’s 10 heading into Friday’s game in Orlando, Fla. The upside is the Americans still control their destiny, with games against a team that has never won a qualifier on American soil (Panama) and the group’s doormat (Trinidad and Tobago). But — uncomfortably — there is a nonzero chance that the United States still can tumble into a tricky playoff as the fourth-place finisher or, worse, even miss the World Cup altogether, if there are any stumbles in the final two games. That is why a win on Friday night — preferably by a goal or two, to assuage any potential goal-differential-tiebreaker concerns — will relieve the pressure immensely. And it’s also why Arena wasn’t interested this week in entertaining any alternative scenarios. “We have no excuses,” Arena said. “We’re not depending on other teams to win games to help us. We’re depending on ourselves.” Friday’s game is on ESPN2 and Univision. Pregame coverage on ESPN2 begins at 7 p.m. Eastern, though the game actually is not scheduled to kick off until 7:35. Sure. It would take a stunning combination of results, but it’s mathematically possible. If the Americans (improbably) lose twice, and Honduras (perhaps even more improbably) gets a result in either of its games, against Costa Rica and Mexico, the Americans will be watching on television next summer. But that is a debate for Saturday morning. In Concacaf, fourth place is a World Cup lifeline. While the top three teams in the final round of qualifying advance directly to the World Cup in Russia, the fourth-place finisher enters a playoff against the fifth-place team in Asia. That will be either Syria or Australia, who are playing a home-and-home playoff of their own this week. The teams tied, 1-1, in the first leg early Thursday in Malaysia, which has served as Syria’s de facto home in qualifying for more than a year, to set up a decisive return match in Sydney on Tuesday — hours ahead of the Americans’ decisive game against Trinidad and Tobago. The Concacaf-Asian Football Confederation intercontinental playoff — another home and home series — will take place in November. More than a few, and some that might surprise casual fans. The biggest? Lionel Messi and Argentina, which currently sits outside the automatic qualifying places in South America. The good news for Messi — and FIFA, and television executives — is that Argentina still controls its destiny. It hosts fourth-place Peru on Thursday and closes against Ecuador. Chile, the reigning South American champion, might have it worse: It is a point behind Argentina, and closes its campaign at Brazil next week. A couple wins would solve everything for both countries, though, even if one is likely headed to a playoff against New Zealand before booking its place in Russia. Russia (as host), Brazil, Belgium, Mexico and the four automatic qualifiers from Asia: Iran, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia are the only teams in the field already. In Africa, Nigeria and Tunisia look set to clinch spots, while Senegal and Ghana are in danger of missing out. In Europe, Germany, England and Serbia can qualify directly with wins this week, and France, Poland and Spain are nearly in position to do the same. Those teams likely to find themselves on the outside looking in next week include the Netherlands, which is set to miss its second major championship in a row, and Wales, the darling of last summer’s Euros, which will be without its injured star Gareth Bale.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Pledges $60 Million for Antiterrorism Force in Africa,"The United States pledged $60 million on Monday to a new United Nations-backed antiterrorism force from five African countries including Niger, where four American soldiers were killed early this month. The pledge, announced by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson in Washington and Ambassador Nikki R. Haley at the United Nations, came as the United Nations Security Council was meeting about the vast and lawless Sahel region in western and north-central Africa, where the force will operate. “Defeating terrorism depends on making sure terrorist organizations cannot have safe havens on any continent,” Mr. Tillerson said in a statement announcing the pledge, which will require congressional approval. “This is a fight we must win, and these funds will play a key role in achieving that mission,” he said. The 5,000-member force of soldiers and police officers, with recruits from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, was created by those countries in February to combat the growing threat of extremist groups, drug smugglers and human traffickers in the Sahel. With little government control, the region is regarded as a fertile haven for Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and their offshoots. The Security Council unanimously endorsed the force in June but questions of how its $500 million annual cost will be financed have not been resolved. The European Union, which has committed about $58 million to the force, will convene a donor conference in December. The United States, the biggest single financial contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations, has been seeking to cut their costs and had resisted proposals to commit peacekeeping resources to the five-nation Sahel force. But the $60 million pledge suggested the American position may be evolving. It was announced less than four weeks after four American soldiers, including Special Forces members, were killed during a joint patrol with counterparts from Niger near the Mali border. Ms. Haley said in her remarks about the Sahel force at the Security Council that “we understand the force will need ongoing support and are eager for opportunities to work with our partners to make this effort a successful one.” The American pledge was welcomed by France, which has taken the lead in Western backing for the Sahel force. France has strong post-colonial ties to all five of the African countries that contributed. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian of France, who led the Security Council meeting on Monday, told reporters afterward that he was “delighted by the statement of American support” and that it was “unquestionably an important development.” It remains unclear exactly how the force will coordinate actions with the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, known as Minusma, one of the biggest and most dangerous peacekeeping operations in Africa with more than 14,000 personnel. Minusma peacekeepers have been attacked frequently by militants. Mr. Le Drian said he was confident that “we will be able to refine the coordination between Minusma and the Joint Force, which is by its very nature a multilateral force.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Response to Storm-Hit Puerto Rico Is Criticized by U.N. Experts,"GENEVA — United Nations experts faulted the United States’ response to hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico in a report on Monday, calling it ineffective and lagging far behind the support provided for storm-struck states on the mainland. More than five weeks after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico with winds of up to 155 miles an hour, conditions remained “alarming” for the island’s 3.5 million people, the group of 11 United Nations independent experts said, calling for a “speedy and well-resourced emergency response.” Thousands left homeless by the storm had no relief in sight, few of the island’s hospitals were functioning, and there were reports that available water supplies were contaminated, the experts said in a statement. About 30 percent of the normal electric power is being generated on the island, officials in Puerto Rico say. “We can’t fail to note the dissimilar urgency and priority given to the emergency response in Puerto Rico, compared to the U.S. states affected by hurricanes in recent months,” said Leilani Farha, the United Nations special rapporteur on housing. The critical report comes as questions continue to swirl around a $300 million contract to help rebuild Puerto Rico’s power grid that was given to a small Montana company. Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló announced on Sunday that he had decided to cancel the disaster-recovery deal that Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the public power company known as Prepa, signed with Whitefish Energy Holdings. He said the controversy had begun to detract from the work being done to restore power on the island. Soon after the deal with Whitefish was announced, questions were raised as to how a two-man company from Montana managed to secure such a lucrative contract. The company has ties to the secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, but both sides say there was no wrongdoing. A House committee is investigating, and the governor has asked the island’s comptroller and the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security to also review the deal. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported on Monday that F.B.I. agents from the San Juan field office were investigating the contract, but such an investigation could not be confirmed. The F.B.I. national office referred questions about the report to the Puerto Rico field office. A spokesman there, Carlos Osorio, said the agency could not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. “While Whitefish is not aware of any such investigation, Whitefish is committed to full cooperation with any inquiry or investigation,” the company said in a statement. “The procurement of the Prepa contract was at all times fully appropriate. Our focus continues to be on our work in Puerto Rico completing the work Prepa has tasked Whitefish to complete including the repair of the second major transmission line.” A spokeswoman for the power authority said the agency had no information about an investigation, and therefore had no comment. The governor’s office said it welcomed an inquiry. “We have not received any information about the F.B.I. looking into the contract, but Governor Rosselló welcomes any investigation by the federal authorities and he has been clear: There should be an investigation on this matter, and if there is any wrongdoing, the persons responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” Yennifer Álvarez, the governor’s spokeswoman, said. “That’s why the Governor has asked for investigations by the Comptroller of Puerto Rico and the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, John Roth.” In a phone interview, Ms. Farha, an independent expert reporting to the United Nations, said it was “very worrying” that she had not been able to obtain clarity on the number of people who were still homeless after the storm. She noted that estimates of the number of houses destroyed ranged from 30,000 to 90,000. Thousands of engineers had been deployed in Texas and Florida to reconnect homes to the electricity grid after hurricanes hit those states, a number far in excess of the crews deployed to Puerto Rico. “FEMA is overall responsible,” Ms. Farha said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “I don’t understand why FEMA can respond so quickly and affirmatively in Texas and why they weren’t deployed similarly in Puerto Rico.” Officials have said that deploying utility crews to an island posed far greater challenges than getting them to communities on the mainland.",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Resumes Taking in Refugees, but 11 Countries Face More Review","WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday resuming the admission of refugees to the United States under tighter security screening. But administration officials said they will subject 11 unidentified countries to another 90-day review for potential threats. The order lifted a suspension on new refugee admissions that Mr. Trump first imposed shortly after taking office in January. At the time, it was part of a broader effort to limit the flow of foreigners admitted to the United States on the grounds of security, an initiative that has generated one of the sharpest legal and political debates of his nine-month-old presidency. The president’s decision to lift the suspension, however, will not end the debate. Administration officials were vague about the additional 90-day review of the 11 countries, refusing even to name them, citing law enforcement sensitivities. They said refugees from those countries could still be admitted on a case-by-case basis during the 90 days if their entry is deemed in the national interest, and they do not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. It was not clear whether the new screening procedures would significantly diminish the chances for many applicants. While refugees who were vetted and approved before Mr. Trump took office have been allowed into the country this year, no new applications have been processed or approved since June. Mr. Trump has already moved aggressively to scale back the nation’s refugee program, imposing a limit of 45,000 — the lowest in more than three decades — on the number of people fleeing persecution that can be resettled in the United States over the fiscal year that started on Oct. 1. The action announced on Tuesday, while restarting the admissions process halted earlier this year, could result in new roadblocks or even outright bans for refugees from the 11 countries, potentially narrowing the pool even further. Refugee advocates said the new order is objectionable, noting that refugee applicants were already carefully screened and that no American has been killed in a terrorist attack by a refugee in the current era of concern over foreign-sponsored terrorism dating to the Sept. 11 attacks. “The administration has had more than six months to review this policy” and “they’ve come back in October to reimpose what will largely be seen as another unreasonable ban that primarily affects Muslims,” said Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International. He called it “a cynical and tragic manipulation of administrative process” that “conflicts with U.S. values and interests.” The White House said that both reviews — the one that has been completed and the new, 90-day one — both aim to secure the United States from a clear danger from terrorist groups seeking to infiltrate the country. “The review process for refugees” required by the president “has made our nation safer,” the new order said. The president’s order came hours after the Supreme Court dismissed the last remaining appeal in a pair of cases challenging an earlier version of Mr. Trump’s travel restrictions, signed in March. The March order was replaced in September with broader limits, so the court, in a brief, unsigned disposition, said the case was now moot. “We express no view on the merits,” the court said. But the September version has separately been blocked by federal district courts in Hawaii and Maryland and it may yet reach the Supreme Court. The dismissal on Tuesday mostly amounted to judicial housekeeping, clearing out challenges to the March order as the justices await eventual appeals from the one issued in September. But the Supreme Court did a little more than simply remove the case from its docket. It also vacated the decision under appeal, from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, meaning it cannot be used as a precedent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying that she would have simply dismissed the case and allowed the appeals court decision to remain on the books. Erasing that precedent may have implications for the new challenge to the September order. Last week, in blocking the new order, Judge Derrick K. Watson, of the Federal District Court in Honolulu, relied heavily on the Ninth Circuit’s decision.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Service Member Killed by Roadside Bomb in Iraq,"WASHINGTON — An American service member in Iraq was killed on Sunday by an improvised roadway bomb, the Pentagon said Monday. A second service member was injured, the Defense Department said. Pentagon officials declined to release the identities of the victims or the location of the bombing, pending notification of family members. Defense Department officials said that the two service members were involved in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq. Since the war against the Islamic State began in 2014, 13 American service members have been killed in Iraq and Syria. Defense Department officials said in recent days that the Islamic State had been thrown into disarray by continued coalition attacks, and that the Iraqi Security Forces, backed by the United States, were well on their way to reclaiming most of the country back from the extremist Sunni group. In recent months, Iraqi forces have taken back the important cities of Mosul and Tal Afar.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Soccer Names Dave Sarachan to Coach Men’s Team Against Portugal,"U.S. Soccer named Dave Sarachan to coach the men’s national team in an exhibition game against Portugal in November, the team’s first match since its humiliating elimination from qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. The appointment is only for the Portugal match, U.S. Soccer said, making Sarachan more of a one-game caretaker than an interim coach. The choice of Sarachan, 63, to replace Bruce Arena, who resigned after a loss to Trinidad and Tobago cost the Americans a trip to Russia, seems to be one of expediency. The game against Portugal in Leiria on Nov. 14 is the only match currently on the United States team’s calendar, and Sarachan, who had been an assistant coach for the national team, and the rest of Arena’s assistants are under contract through the end of the year. Sarachan spent decades as an assistant coach under Arena at the University of Virginia, in Major League Soccer and during Arena’s two stints leading the national team. His appointment signals that other candidates who had expressed interest in the national team job — notably Tab Ramos, the former American midfielder who coaches the under-20 national team — were unwilling to accept the position with such a tenuous commitment from the federation. The search for Arena’s long-term replacement will begin in earnest after the Portugal game, but it remains unclear how long the process will take. U.S. Soccer plans to appoint a search committee to investigate candidates, but it can only do that after completing an announced autopsy into what went wrong with the men’s qualifying campaign, and after discerning what solutions — or change of direction — it wants the new coach to implement with the national team program. There could be other delays. If U.S. Soccer identifies a candidate who is coaching a different country in next summer’s World Cup, for example, a permanent coach for the national team might not be hired until late in 2018. In any case, it is not likely that a decision will be made until after U.S. Soccer holds its presidential election in February. The current president, Sunil Gulati, has not announced whether he will seek a fourth term but is widely expected to run again. Three other candidates have announced that they will enter the race: the former United States forward Eric Wynalda, who now works for Fox Sports; Steven H. Gans, a lawyer in Boston who has harshly criticized Gulati’s leadership; and Paul Lapointe, an official with the amateur United Premier Soccer League. Sarachan will name his roster for the Portugal match early next month. It is expected that he will call in a team built around Europe-based professionals — players like DeAndre Yedlin, Fabian Johnson and John Brooks, if he is healthy — as well as M.L.S. players not participating in the league’s playoffs and promising young players who might figure into the next qualifying cycle.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Soccer Takes One Giant Step Back,"On Soccer Argentina was in danger on Tuesday of failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. So was the United States. The contrast in the urgency of their responses was staggering. Lionel Messi found the oxygen of deliverance 9,000 feet above sea level, scoring a wondrous and determined hat trick as Argentina defeated Ecuador, 3-1, on the road in Quito. “Pressure makes diamonds,” Ray Hudson, the cockeyed poet of a commentator, said of Messi. “Nothing less than witchcraft from the sorcerer of football.” Pressure also crumbles resolve. The Americans were shockingly torpid in the heat and humidity at Trinidad and Tobago, wilting in a 2-1 defeat that kept them out of the World Cup for the first time since 1986. Had Argentina not qualified, it would have provoked national shame. Another referendum on Messi would have found him deficient, compared with Diego Maradona, in the unresolvable debate about the greatest of all time. On the other hand, soccer’s primacy in Argentina would not have been diminished in the slightest. In the United States, defeat brought hot-take recrimination on Twitter and examination on ESPN, but nothing like the scorn of national outrage. Soccer doesn’t elicit that same rawness of collective emotion here. When defender Omar Gonzalez, who put a ball into his own net, later told reporters, “We let down an entire nation,” his dejection was understandable but his remark seemed overstated. And yet absence from the 2018 World Cup may be more acutely felt — may represent a greater setback — in the United States than in countries where soccer is the No. 1 sport, Andrei Markovits, a Michigan professor and co-author of “Offside: Soccer and American Exceptionalism,” argued in a late-night phone call. The arc of American soccer’s rise was nearly continuous for more than 25 years. The men had played in seven consecutive World Cups. The women had won three World Cup titles. Domestic leagues had found stability. The fan base had bulged among adults to 79 million from 59 million between 2010 and 2016, according to a study cited by Sports Illustrated. Teenagers had begun to rate soccer among their favorite sports. And now that ascent has been interrupted. Missing the World Cup, the premier international sporting event, is “a bigger loss, a bigger handicap, a bigger interruption” for the United States in terms of building the sport than it is in soccer-dominant countries, Markovits said. There probably won’t be any impingement on the bid by the United States, Mexico and Canada to host the 2026 World Cup. And Major League Soccer, though the comparisons aren’t precise, is positioned to continue outdrawing the average attendance of the N.B.A. and the N.H.L. Devoted fans will watch on television next summer as the World Cup plays out in Russia. But soccer evangelism is what figures to suffer. Casual fans seem less likely to show up at watch parties. Even if they do, they will be unable to find the same ecstatic release that so many did in 2010, when Landon Donovan scored his late, rescuing goal against Algeria. “It doesn’t mean that soccer here is going back to the Dark Ages, when it was basically a fringe sport played by Hungarian émigrés,” Markovits said. “But this retards it, no question about it. It is a grave deficit.” And yet countries with greater soccer pedigrees than the United States will also be absent from the 2018 World Cup or will face the nervous proposition of a home-and-home playoff to gain admittance. Chile is out. The Netherlands, a three-time runner-up, is out. Italy, a four-time champion, is on life support in a playoff. Only Brazil has perfect attendance at the 20 World Cups played since the tournament began in 1930. (Germany also has qualified each of the 18 times it has participated.) The architecture of soccer — its low scoring, its capacity for the strange goal, its shoehorning of the final World Cup qualification phase into 10 matches — lends it to extreme randomness not generally found in football, baseball or basketball, said Stefan Szymanski, also a Michigan professor and author of “Money and Soccer.” To say that missing the World Cup “shows everything is wrong with the United States doesn’t follow,” Szymanski said. “This doesn’t prove that. Stuff happens. It’s the nature of the game and not necessarily surprising to see the U.S. knocked out.” In some sense, he said, the United States is now being officially welcomed to the torment of international soccer. “This is what being a soccer fan is like,” said Szymanski, who grew up with vicissitudes of English soccer. “You’re prone to the extreme event all the time. There’s no royal road, unless you’re Brazil or Germany.” Even then, Brazil, a five-time winner of the World Cup, can sustain the humiliation of a 7-1 loss to Germany at home, as it did in the 2014 semifinals. Late Tuesday night, there was an immediate, if undeveloped, call for change in American soccer. Surely, Bruce Arena will not continue for long in his second stint as national coach. The team figures to get younger as it builds around the teenage wonder Christian Pulisic. Perhaps the wave of disappointment will ripple into February’s election for president of the United States Soccer Federation, as Sunil Gulati is expected to seek a fourth term. But change in development is never easy. Szymanski’s research of international teams, dating to 1950, has found a sobering truth. While the least developed nations are closing the gap on the most developed nations, those teams stuck in the middle, like the United States, are struggling to make the leap to the top. As the Americans muddle along as the world’s 28th-ranked team, struggling to advance beyond the second round of the World Cup since reaching the quarterfinals in 2002, elite teams like Germany and Spain have found new ways of playing. Germany, the defending champion, supplemented its precision with a faster tempo borrowed from the English Premier League. Spain, the 2010 champion, countered the physical size of European players with the elegant style of passing and movement known as tiki taka. And so it will be left to the United States, chronically unable to finish its chances in front of the goal, to enhance its approach with innovation, freedom of expression and the openness to try different schemes, Szymanski said. “The teams that dominate the World Cup are the same ones every year,” he said. “It’s a problem for many countries, similar to the U.S., that aspire to reach that elite group. It’s very tough to move there.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Soldiers Were Separated From Unit in Niger Ambush, Officials Say","WASHINGTON — In the chaotic moments after an Army Special Forces team and 30 Nigerien troops were ambushed by militants in a remote corner of West Africa three weeks ago, four of the Americans were separated from the larger group. Their squad mates immediately alerted commanders that they were under attack — then called for help nearly an hour later, as a top Pentagon official said this week — and ground forces from Niger’s army and French Mirage jets were both dispatched. About two hours later, the firefight tapering off, French helicopters from nearby Mali swooped in to the rescue on the rolling wooded terrain. But they retrieved only seven of the 11 Americans. The four others were inexplicably left behind, no longer in radio contact and initially considered missing in action by the Pentagon, a status that officials say raises the possibility they were still alive when the helicopters took off without them. United States officials insisted that other American, French and Nigerien forces were in the area when the helicopters lifted off. When Americans suffer casualties in an operation, the wounded are typically evacuated before the dead, officials said. The bodies of three dead Americans and the team’s interpreter were found hours later. But American military officials still cannot explain why it took two more days and an exhaustive search by troops from all three countries to find the body of the fourth soldier, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, discovered by Nigerien troops in the woods near the ambush site. New details emerging from the military’s investigation into the ambush and interviews with military officials and lawmakers have revealed, once again, changes to the timeline in a shifting narrative that has bedeviled top Pentagon officials. It has prompted increasingly frustrated members of Congress to demand answers for how a shadowy mission in an austere region of Africa left four Americans and five Nigeriens dead, including the interpreter. The questions — including the mission’s shifting goals, the intelligence assessment to back it up, how the soldiers were separated and the frantic search for Sergeant Johnson’s body — were at the forefront on Thursday when senior military officers and their civilian Pentagon bosses traveled to Capitol Hill to give separate two-hour classified briefings for members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who heads the Senate panel and who has criticized the Defense Department for failing to provide lawmakers details of the ambush, praised the briefing without divulging details. But he emphasized that he still had “100 questions” that the officials could not yet answer. Pentagon officials said they would need 30 days to wrap up their inquiry, Mr. McCain said. Other senators on the committee said it could take up to 60 days. Army Maj. Gen. Roger L. Cloutier Jr., the chief of staff of the military’s Africa Command in Germany, is leading the inquiry. “It’s clearer, but there’s still a lot of things that they don’t know,” said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida. “Why did it take 48 hours to find Sergeant Johnson? We don’t know that yet.” Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said many lawmakers were surprised to learn the scope of American military missions in Africa and, in particular, the size of the military presence in Niger, where 800 United States troops conduct training missions and drone operations. “I don’t think Congress has been completely kept up to date,” Mr. Kaine said. The mystery of what happened that day only deepened as new details emerged from interviews with more than a half dozen military officers, Pentagon officials and lawmakers this week. On the night of Oct. 3, two groups set off in rural southwest Niger. One was a team of American, French and Nigerien commandos on a clandestine operation to kill or capture an Islamic State operative, part of a broader mission code-named Obsidian Nomad. The other group — made up of about eight Army Special Forces, three American soldiers in support roles and their interpreter, along with 30 Nigerien troops — was on a separate reconnaissance patrol. At some later point, the team was asked to back up the first group if needed. Bad weather scotched the raid, intended to be launched from helicopters. But the second group remained in the region, after being asked by commanders to search further for evidence of the Islamic State jihadist, code-named Naylor Road by the military. On the morning of Oct. 4, the team swung through the village of Tongo Tongo to resupply and met with local elders out of courtesy. Villagers might have tipped off Islamic State militants in the area, Nigerien and American military officials have said. One military official, however, said on Thursday that a villager told the troops that an important Islamic State emir was in the area, possibly alerting them that the extremists were approaching. Shortly after the American soldiers, who were led by an Army captain, and the Nigerien troops left the village, heading back to base about two hours away, some 50 Islamic State militants armed with machine guns and heavy weapons ambushed the group at about 11:40 a.m. local time. Lightly armed with no heavy weapons of their own, the American and Nigerien forces tried to defend themselves. Outgunned and taking casualties, the soldiers tried to stand their ground until additional Nigerien troops rushed to the scene. It was not clear when the Nigeriens, along with French troops, arrived, but American officials indicated that they had made it to the ambush site by the time the seven Americans were evacuated. When troops from the elite Joint Special Operations Command were alerted to the situation, however, they were told that several Americans were missing. That calls into question Pentagon officials’ earlier assertions that either the Nigerien forces or French helicopters were with the bodies of at least three of the soldiers until they were recovered — an insistence that underscores the mantra that no soldier is left behind. “The U.S. military does not leave our troops behind,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week. Eventually, the team of American commandos originally scheduled to target the Islamic State militant the previous night were dropped near the ambush site and found the bodies of three of their comrades: Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright. But at least one American was still missing. Commandos from Sigonella, Italy, and Djibouti rushed to Niger’s capital, Niamey, while a reserve unit of Special Forces stationed at Africa Command headquarters in Germany prepared to deploy if needed. Sergeant Johnson’s body was found by Nigeriens on the evening of Oct. 6. After the ambush, American units in the region were forced to change radio frequencies because communications equipment was missing and believed compromised by enemy forces. The American-backed operations to topple the Islamic State from its strongholds in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, could increase the risks in Africa, if Islamic State fighters flee to the continent to continue their mayhem there, as some have begun to do. “The more we succeed in the Middle East, the more we’re going to see the snakes run to Africa,” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said on Thursday. “We’ve got to be prepared to advise and assist the nations there that are willing to work with us.” Some lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called for hearings to help explain what went wrong in Niger. “I need to be able to look families in the eye and explain what our mission is, what mistakes were made in this incident, who made them and why,” Mr. Blumenthal said.",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Stood By as Indonesia Killed a Half-Million People, Papers Show","BANGKOK — It was an anti-Communist blood bath of at least half a million Indonesians. And American officials watched it happen without raising any public objections, at times even applauding the forces behind the killing, according to newly declassified State Department files that show diplomats meticulously documenting the purge in 1965-66. In one of the documents, released on Tuesday, an American political affairs counselor describes how Indonesian officials dealt with prisons overflowing with suspected members of the Indonesian Communist Party, known by the acronym P.K.I. “Many provinces appear to be successfully meeting this problem by executing their P.K.I. prisoners, or by killing them before they are captured,” said the cable sent in 1965 from the American Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, to the State Department. Another cable describes how clerics from an influential Muslim organization in Indonesia advised their flocks that atheist “P.K.I. members are classified as lowest order of infidel, the shedding of whose blood is comparable to killing a chicken.” The level of detail in the cables helps fill out a picture, outlined by previous declassifications of documents, relating to how an anti-American leader in Indonesia was deposed by the military amid mass extrajudicial executions. “We knew about these things more generally, but it’s great to have this information in black and white so it’s not just based on oral interviews with victims,” said John Roosa, an associate professor of history at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and author of a book on the events of 1965. “The U.S. was following what was happening very closely, and if it weren’t for its support, you could argue that the army would never have felt the confidence to take power.” The Indonesian slaughter took place at a time when Southeast Asia, still emerging from colonialism, was energized by socialist ideology. The United States already had boots on the ground in Vietnam. Indonesia, then led by President Sukarno and home to one of the world’s largest Communist parties, was seen by Washington as the next domino that could fall. When a group of hard-line generals blamed Communist Party operatives for a failed coup attempt in 1965, with China accused as a mastermind, Washington did little to challenge that narrative. The United States government largely stayed silent as the death toll mounted at the hands of the Indonesian Army, paramilitaries and religious mobs. The extrajudicial killings spread beyond suspected Communists to target ethnic Chinese, students, union members and anyone who might have personal feuds with the hit men. Tens of thousands of others were thrown into tropical gulags. Eventually, President Sukarno, with his anti-American talk and socialist sympathies, was replaced by Suharto, a general who held power for 32 years, instituting a policy he called the New Order to reinvigorate the economy through foreign aid and investment. Another of the newly released cables shows how the American Embassy in Jakarta made clear that any aid from the United States was contingent on Sukarno’s being removed from power. Upon Suharto’s ascension in March 1966, that American aid began to flow. In some of the cables, American diplomats exulted in the abrupt political transition, even as they noted the rising body count. One file refers to the political changes as a “fantastic switch.” The Indonesian military, which still wields considerable power today, has tried to blame the orgy of violence on a public furious with the excesses of the Communist Party, absolving itself of direct culpability. But the cables indicate how members of the American foreign service, at least, held the military directly responsible for some of the deaths. One cable alleges that Suharto gave the orders for certain mass executions. On Wednesday, Pooja Jhunjhunwala, a State Department spokeswoman, said that the department was aware of the documents and noted that the United States government had declassified other documents related to America’s relations with Indonesia in the 1960s. “The State Department supports the declassification of any relevant documents from the period which do not pose a national security risk,” she said in a statement. In 2015, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico reintroduced a resolution in the Senate calling for Indonesia to face up to its traumatic history. He also held the United States to account for its “military and financial support” there, which included providing lists of possible leftist sympathizers to the Indonesian government and, as one cable released Tuesday showed, pushing to bury foreign news coverage of the killings. The legacy of the massacre continues to divide Indonesia. For decades, under Suharto’s rule, Indonesians dared not call for justice. Even after he was deposed in 1998, there was little effort to set up an Indonesian form of a truth and reconciliation commission. But in part after the filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer released a documentary in 2012 called “The Act of Killing,” chronicling the life of an unrepentant hit man in the purge, members of Indonesian society began to delve into its history. Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, has talked about the need to address past human rights violations. Still, there are limits to how far Indonesia is willing to go. Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, a human rights lawyer, helped convene an international people’s tribunal on the killings at The Hague in 2015. (The court had no real authority beyond an airing of testimony, but it held the Indonesian government responsible for crimes against humanity and accused the United States, Britain and Australia of complicity.) But in recent months, conservative groups have rekindled anti-Communist sensibilities in Indonesia. Efforts last month to organize screenings of Mr. Oppenheimer’s second documentary, “The Look of Silence,” were restricted by a military directive. A mob gathered around a building where Ms. Katjasungkana and others were believed to be gathering to talk about the violence. “I just hope these new documents will encourage the Indonesian government to be more open and stop the state denial that the military was involved in these atrocities,” she said. “Hopefully, America will also admit its involvement.” Jusuf Wanandi is a Chinese-Indonesian who supported Suharto for decades, even if he grew disillusioned with his strongman-like leadership. Unlike many of Suharto’s former acolytes, Mr. Wanandi admits that the events of 1965-66 spiraled out of control. Yet even he advised patience. “It is impossible to move forward because emotions are still raw,” Mr. Wanandi said. “We need some more time.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Suspends Visa Services in Turkey, and Turkey Responds in Kind","ISTANBUL — The United States said on Sunday that it was suspending nonimmigrant visa services at its diplomatic facilities in Turkey after the arrest of a consulate employee, prompting Turkey to halt visa services in America. The United States Embassy in Ankara, the Turkish capital, issued a statement from the United States Mission to Turkey saying that recent events had forced it to “reassess the commitment of the government of Turkey to the security of U.S. Mission facilities and personnel.” The Turkish Embassy in Washington responded with a similar statement late Sunday, saying it would “reassess the commitment of the government of the United States to the security of Turkish mission facilities and personnel.” It said the measures would apply to e-Visas, visas issued at borders and visas in passports. Last week, the Turkish authorities arrested a United States Consulate employee of Turkish nationality over alleged links to the network of the United States-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the Turkish government blames for last summer’s failed coup. Mr. Gulen denies involvement. The employee, Metin Topuz, is accused of espionage and “attempting to overthrow the Turkish government and constitution.” Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency reported that he was accused of communicating with former police chiefs in a 2013 corruption inquiry, 121 people involved in the attempted coup and hundreds of people using an encrypted mobile messaging app. The United States Embassy said it was “deeply disturbed” by the arrest. The American statement said the suspension of nonimmigrant visa services was “effective immediately” to minimize visitor numbers to the United States Embassy and Consulate for now. The suspended services will affect visas for business people, tourists, medical patients, students, journalists and treaty trader, as well as diplomatic and official visas. Relations between Turkey and the United States have been tense over disagreements about Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the United States backs in the war against the Islamic State. Turkey considers them a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which has waged an insurgency within Turkey for more than 30 years. A brawl during a visit by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to Washington in May led to the indictment of 19 people, including 15 Turkish security officials. Mr. Erdogan called the indictment “scandalous” and said that his security detail had been protecting him against Kurdish militants protesting outside his ambassador’s residence.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Targets Terrorist Financing With New Round of Sanctions,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on eight individuals and a business affiliated with the Islamic State in Yemen and with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in the first coordinated action taken with a newly formed center to combat terrorist financing led by the United States and Saudi Arabia. The fresh round of sanctions was unveiled by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, as he embarks on a four-country trip to the Middle East intended to strengthen America’s capacity to crack down on terrorist financing networks. President Trump has made attacking terrorist financing a priority in his first year in office, and the Treasury has been increasingly working with Persian Gulf countries to freeze the assets of people who are plotting attacks. The Terrorist Financing Targeting Center was established in May during Mr. Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also members of the group, and have agreed to share information about the financing of terrorism. “Our enemies have felt the effects of being blocked from the world financial system,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a speech at the Future Investment Initiative summit in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. “They are finding it harder to raise, move and distribute money.” The United States has in recent months imposed sanctions to stem North Korea’s financing and development of weapons of mass destruction and earlier this month targeted Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Mr. Mnuchin said he is also focused on targeting fund-raising efforts that prop up the Taliban in Afghanistan and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Among the individuals sanctioned on Wednesday were Abu Sulayman al-Adani, the head of the Islamic State’s Yemen affiliate, Nashwan al-Wali al-Yafi’I, the group’s chief financial officer, and Khalid al-Marfadi, a militant who helped coordinate joint operations between the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in Yemen. This week Mr. Mnuchin is also traveling to Israel, where he will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, before heading to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Despite the commitment for more coordination between the countries, Mr. Mnuchin’s trip comes at a particularly complicated time for the region. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and imposed a travel blockade on the country over allegations that it supports terrorism. Since then the administration has been attempting to ease tension between the countries. The Treasury secretary traveled to the region with a delegation that included Sigal Mandelker, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, and Dina Powell, the administration’s deputy national security adviser. Mr. Mnuchin traveled on a Boeing 737 military plane and was accompanied by his wife, Louise Linton. A former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood film producer, Mr. Mnuchin has acknowledged that targeting terrorists is a new world for him. However, he has said that he spends about half of his time dealing with national security issues and in June suggested that he would like more funding to build up the department’s terrorism and financial crimes unit. Mr. Mnuchin’s first trip to the region also comes at a frenzied time for his domestic agenda. He has been advising Mr. Trump as he weighs his choices for the next chairman of the Federal Reserve and a decision is expected to come within days. Meanwhile, the Republicans in the House are expected to unveil legislation to overhaul the tax code as early as next week. Mr. Mnuchin is the administration’s point person for selling the plan. International investors have been keeping a close eye on the machinations over the tax bill in the United States, and on Wednesday Mr. Mnuchin said that a coming mix of tax cuts and deregulation would soon make America’s economy more competitive. “It has been over 30 years since we have had comprehensive tax reform in our country,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This has hurt our workers, made our businesses uncompetitive, and left trillions of dollars of American business profits offshore.” He added: “We are working to change this.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Threatens to Punish Myanmar Over Treatment of Rohingya,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration threatened on Monday to take punitive actions against Myanmar unless it pulls back from its violent military campaign against Rohingya Muslims, expressing what it called “our gravest concern” over a crisis that has killed or displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The State Department said it has already cut off travel waivers allowing current and former senior military leaders into the country and was considering further actions to impose economic measures against those responsible for atrocities against Myanmar’s ethnic minority. The department said that all military units involved in operations against the Rohingya were ineligible for American aid. “The government of Burma, including its armed forces, must take immediate action to ensure peace and security; implement commitments to ensure humanitarian access to communities in desperate need; facilitate the safe and voluntary return of those who have fled or been displaced in Rakhine State; and address the root causes of systematic discrimination against the Rohingya,” the department said in a statement issued Monday night, using the former name for Myanmar. The American warning came as the United Nations said the Rohingya Muslims who have fled deadly persecution in Myanmar to Bangladesh would soon exceed one million. That prediction loomed over an emergency donors conference in Geneva to raise money for aid groups struggling to help Bangladesh, one of the world’s poorest countries, deal with the crisis. Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity, called the health conditions of the refugee encampments a “time bomb.” More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have battled terror, exhaustion and hunger to reach safety in Bangladesh since Myanmar’s army began a campaign of what the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing in late August. The new arrivals joined more than 300,000 Rohingya who had escaped in recent years. The number of people crossing the Naf River that divides the two countries has slowed to about 1,000 to 3,000 a day, down from a peak of 12,000 to 18,000 a day earlier in the crisis, said William Lacy Swing, the director of the International Organization for Migration, a part of the United Nations. Still, he said, “even at that rate the numbers are expected to exceed a million shortly.” More than 300,000 children are among the Rohingya refugees. Mark Lowcock, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator, told reporters that many were acutely malnourished. States had previously committed around $116 million toward the $430 million sought by the United Nations for humanitarian aid over the next six months. Pledges received from governments on Monday raised the total to about $340 million, Mr. Lowcock said, expressing confidence that additional contributions would flow in coming days. Even so, humanitarian agencies face enormous challenges delivering relief. Hundreds of thousands of refugees were crammed on a strip of land that lacked roads or infrastructure to support the delivery of aid. With 210 hospital beds available to support more than 900,000 people living with little access to clean water, sanitation or medical care, the refugees’ situation is a “time bomb ticking toward a full-blown health crisis,” Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders told the meeting. The United Nations food aid agency said that it had distributed food to 580,000 people since the crisis erupted, but that it had so far received less than one-third of the $77 million it needs to aid a million people over six months. Queen Rania of Jordan, who visited some of the camps on Monday, expressed shock at the conditions. “It is unforgivable that this crisis is unfolding, largely ignored by the international community,” she said in a statement.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Trade Deficit Shrank in August as Exports Rose,"WASHINGTON — Rising exports and falling imports shrank the United States’ trade deficit in goods and services to the lowest level in nearly a year, data released Thursday by the Commerce Department showed. The trade deficit — the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports — narrowed to $42.4 billion in August, down $1.2 billion from July. Exports for the month were $195.3 billion, while imports came to $237.7 billion. The nation’s trade deficits with China and the European Union both shrank in August. Josh Feinman, the chief economist of Deutsche Asset Management, said those trends were largely the result of a strengthening global economy that buoyed American exports, as well as the weakening of the value of the dollar. “Global growth is looking better,” Mr. Feinman said. “That does create a little bit of a tailwind for exports.” He cautioned that the economic impact of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, could be distorting the data somewhat, as ports closed and people stayed home from work and shops. Despite the narrowing in August, the overall trade deficit is still growing on an annual basis. It was up 8.8 percent in the first eight months from the same period in 2016, according to Commerce Department data. President Trump has often pointed to the trade deficit as evidence that the United States is not benefiting from global trade in the way that it should. He has promised that his America-first policy will help shrink the gap, consistently citing deficits with other countries as a sign that the United States is losing when it comes to global trade. And he has typically blamed trade agreements and negotiators for failing to achieve the best terms for American exporters. The administration has commissioned a comprehensive report on the state of significant trade deficits, which has not yet been released to the public. Economists caution against reading too much into the trade deficit, particularly monthly swings, as a measure of the administration’s success in giving America the economic upper hand. That’s because the trade deficit is closely linked with multiple macroeconomic factors including like the relative growth rates of countries, the value of currencies, the strength of the dollar as a global reserve currency, and global trends in savings and investment. A better measure of success for Mr. Trump’s America-first policy, economists say, would be putting more Americans to work, and rising growth and productivity gains over all. In an emailed response, Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said such macroeconomic factors did not explain the huge increase in the trade deficits the United States has seen with other countries in the past: China immediately after its admission to the World Trade Organization, Mexico after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed or South Korea after the United States signed a trade deal with that country. “China’s trade surplus is what has fueled their economic growth for many years,” he wrote. “If a trade surplus is good for China how can a trade deficit be anything but bad for us?” Many economists do not see the trade gap as a negative. Bryan Riley, an economist at the Heritage Foundation who supports free trade, said the trade deficit was not necessarily a sign of trouble but can be good or bad, depending on the circumstances. Mr. Riley pointed out that in recent years, the economy has grown faster when the trade deficit was getting bigger, and slower when it was getting smaller. Mr. Riley said the administration’s tax policies might have a greater impact than trade policy on the trade deficit if changes to the tax code end up making the United States economy more competitive and attract more investment. While the Trump administration would consider such tax changes to be a success, Mr. Riley said they could make the trade deficit even bigger — if, for example, lower taxes expand economic growth, giving Americans more money to buy goods from abroad, or encourage foreigners to invest more in the United States. Not every economist thinks that a trade deficit is harmless. Some, especially those on the left, see persistent imbalances as a potentially troubling sign that the United States has lost manufacturing jobs to other countries. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden, said that while the president should not look to trade deficits as a “scorecard” from month to month, Mr. Trump “was onto something” with his intuition that persistent trade deficits reflected a structural problem of fewer goods being produced in the United States. But Mr. Bernstein agreed that it would be difficult for the president’s actions to have much influence on trade flows, which are determined by broader economic factors. He predicted that the country’s trade balance when Mr. Trump leaves office would be pretty similar to what it was when he came in. As powerful as the president and economic policy can be, they pale in comparison with millions of American consumers and producers — and the multinational supply chains that have long existed to serve those needs. “Cargo ships aren’t going to disappear because of saber rattling,” Mr. Bernstein said. “You actually have to implement pretty drastic policies to disrupt these flows, which are embedded in the global economy. The things you’ve heard them talking about are pretty marginal.” That seems unlikely to dissuade Mr. Trump from citing the metric. On Monday, he told Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister of Thailand, that he wanted to reduce the trade deficit with that country. “I think we’re going to try and sell a little bit more to you now,” the president said. An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the organization where Bryan Riley is an economist. It is the Heritage Foundation, not the Heritage Institution.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Troops Ambushed in Niger Waited an Hour to Call for Help,"WASHINGTON — American troops who came under fire in Niger during a deadly ambush this month might have waited more than an hour before calling for help, the top United States military officer said on Monday. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he did not want to speculate about why service members took so long to call for backup, but suggested one reason might be that they thought they could fight back against the Islamic State-affiliated militants who attacked them. “My judgment would be that unit thought they could handle the situation,” General Dunford told reporters at the Pentagon, but added that until a full investigation was complete, defense officials would not be able to explain the delay. After another hour, he said, French aircraft and warplanes arrived at the scene. General Dunford’s comments were the fullest explanation so far from the Trump administration about the ambush and what led up to it. About a dozen members of an Army Special Forces unit joined roughly 30 Nigerien soldiers and embarked on what was initially expected to be a routine reconnaissance mission. But they were attacked by about 50 militants while returning to base, and four Americans and four Nigeriens were killed. Two Americans were wounded, as were six Nigeriens. The mission’s planners had said that encountering enemy forces was unlikely, according to General Dunford. The Pentagon is investigating whether the mission was altered after the unit left its operating base, he said. American forces in Niger operate under strict rules that forbid them to go on missions that could involve contact with an enemy. According to General Dunford, the Americans and their Nigerien counterparts departed for the mission early on Oct. 3 and were attacked a day later while returning to base. The Pentagon is investigating inconsistent accounts about what prompted the attack. They differ on the question of whether the troops pursued the Islamic militants, who were on motorbikes, or simply saw them from a distance and were later ambushed as they questioned local villagers about the militants. Though helicopters did not arrive until an hour after the troops called for help, a drone arrived overhead in minutes, General Dunford said, though he would not say whether it was armed. Communications between troops and their higher commands, especially for Special Operations Forces operating far afield from other friendly units, can be difficult. General Dunford did not rule out that the Green Berets could have tried to call for help during that initial hour but were unsuccessful. “I make no judgment about how long it took them to ask for support. I don’t know that they thought they needed support prior to that time,” General Dunford said. “I don’t know how this attack unfolded. I don’t know what their initial assessment was of what they were confronted with.” General Dunford said that the two wounded Americans were evacuated by French helicopters and that the bodies of three Americans who were killed were evacuated in the early evening of Oct. 4. The body of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, a mechanic serving with the unit, was recovered two nights later. General Dunford said that the French support was part of the mission’s plan and that French, Nigerien and American troops searched nonstop for Sergeant Johnson, though he would not say how many American forces were involved in the search. France has roughly 4,000 forces deployed to the region, part of a military campaign that began in 2013 to drive Qaeda militants from Mali. The soldiers’ deaths underscored the growing American military presence in Niger, overlooked by much of the public. In 2013, only 100 American troops were stationed there. Now, roughly 800 American troops are in Niger, the majority of them committed to building a new drone base in the city of Agadez. About 6,000 American troops are spread across Africa, mostly concentrated in Niger, Djibouti and Somalia. General Dunford said that the Pentagon owes answers to the families of all four American service members who were killed in the attack. His hourlong news conference was part of the Pentagon’s latest effort to contain the political fallout from the ambush, which has grown as President Trump has feuded with a congresswoman close to the family of Sergeant Johnson. Defense officials said the Pentagon has begun a review of how the military conducts its advise-and-assist missions to train African troops across the continent.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Warning to Pakistan: Stop Backing Terrorism,"ISLAMABAD — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson stopped in Islamabad on his way to New Delhi on Tuesday to deliver what he hoped would be a sobering message to Pakistan: Stop funding or providing shelter to terrorist groups. Now. It is a message the United States has been giving the Pakistanis in various forms since the Sept. 11 attacks, and it is one the Pakistanis have by turns harkened to, bristled at and shrugged off — sometimes in the same meeting — for years. In tackling the deeply dysfunctional relationship between the United States and Pakistan, the Trump administration is finding that it is not unlike some difficult marriages: all but impossible to fix, but also impossible to end. There were few signs on Tuesday that this 16-year-old dynamic had changed. Mr. Tillerson met with three of Pakistan’s top leaders at the elegant prime minister’s residence in Islamabad: Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi; the foreign minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif; and, most important, the Army’s chief of staff, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa. At a formal greeting before a portrait of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who is considered the father of Pakistan, Mr. Tillerson began with reassurances. “Pakistan is important, as you know, regionally to the U.S. security relationships and so important regionally to our joint goals of providing peace and security to the region and providing opportunity for a greater economic relationship as well,” he said. Mr. Abbasi, wearing a traditional white kurta next to Mr. Tillerson’s dark suit, responded cheerfully but pointedly. “The U.S. can rest assured that we are strategic partners in the war against terror and that today Pakistan is fighting the largest war in the world against terror,” he said. The United States believes that Pakistan has for years supported terrorist groups, like the Haqqani network, that attack American troops in Afghanistan, undermining the 16-year effort to defeat the Taliban. But for just as long, the United States has relied on Pakistani air and land routes to supply both American and Afghan forces. Without Pakistan, the United States would not be able to keep troops in Afghanistan — but it also might not need to, some American observers suggest. “What do you do when your allies are part of the problem?” asked Daniel L. Byman, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University. “The desire to turn our backs on these people is there, but then you worry that terrorists will have more operational freedom and it will cost you more in the long run.” In public, the Pakistanis say they have killed more terrorists at greater cost in lives lost than any other nation. In private, they say they must hedge their bets against the inevitable day when American troops leave Afghanistan. In the days leading up to Mr. Tillerson’s visit, the United States conducted a flurry of airstrikes along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, fulfilling President Trump’s promise in August to intensify attacks against the Taliban and Haqqani network, which has run a virtual factory in Pakistan since 2005 to supply suicide bombers in Afghanistan. Local news media outlets reported more than a dozen missile strikes that killed scores of Haqqani fighters. The strikes, many of them in Pakistani territory, are deeply irritating to Pakistan, which considers them a threat to its sovereignty. Along with the attacks, the Trump administration has toughened its rhetoric. In a speech last week that offered effusive praise for India, Mr. Tillerson warned, “We expect Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based there that threaten its own people and the broader region.” Senior Pakistani army and intelligence officials expressed confidence in background interviews in recent days that the Trump administration cannot sustain a hostile stance for too long. The Pakistanis are keenly aware that the United States relies on them not only for supplies of material, but also for intelligence. The Obama administration worked to reduce its reliance on Pakistan in part by reaching a reconciliation with Iran, the only other viable option for supplying troops in Afghanistan. India is building a port in the Iranian city of Chabahar, where supplies could be landed and shipped to Afghanistan. C. Christine Fair, an associate professor at Georgetown University, argues that Pakistan represents a far greater threat to American interests than Iran does. It was Pakistan that provided nuclear technology to North Korea and Libya, and Pakistan’s proxies have killed more American troops than Iran’s, she said. But the Trump administration’s hostility toward Iran — Mr. Trump has threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear accord — has closed off such a strategy, so the United States must rely on Pakistan. “It’s like a woman trying to leave an abusive marriage when she has no money,” Ms. Fair said. “How do you do that?” Will tougher rhetoric change Pakistani behavior? Experts are skeptical. “Getting tough on Pakistan, which we’ve tried before, never works,” said Ryan C. Crocker, a former ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. “In fact, it has the opposite effect. They just dig in deeper.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Will Withdraw From Unesco, Citing Its ‘Anti-Israel Bias’","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, after years of the United States distancing itself because of what it called the group’s “anti-Israel bias.” The administration also cited mounting arrears at the organization as a reason for the decision. “We were in arrears to the tune of $550 million or so, and so the question is, do we want to pay that money?” Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said Thursday at a news briefing. She added, “With this anti-Israel bias that’s long documented on the part of Unesco, that needs to come to an end.” While the United States withdrew from the group, the Trump administration said it wanted to continue providing American perspective and expertise to Unesco, but as a nonmember observer. The withdrawal goes into effect at the end of 2018, but that decision could be revisited, officials said. If Unesco returns “to a place where they’re truly promoting culture and education on all of that, perhaps we could take another look at this,” Ms. Nauert said. Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization popularly known for its designation of World Heritage sites, is a global development agency with missions that include promoting sex education, literacy, clean water and equality for women. In a lengthy written statement, Irina Bokova, Unesco’s director general, expressed regret at the decision and said that the American people shared the organization’s goals. “Universality is critical to Unesco’s mission to strengthen international peace and security in the face of hatred and violence, to defend human rights and dignity,” she wrote. In 2011, the United States stopped funding Unesco because of what was then a forgotten, 15-year-old amendment mandating a complete cutoff of American financing to any United Nations agency that accepts Palestine as a full member. Various efforts by President Barack Obama to overturn the legal restriction narrowly failed in Congress, and the United States lost its vote at the organization after two years of nonpayment, in 2013. Unesco was dependent on the United States for 22 percent of its budget, then about $70 million a year. During the Cold War, the United States withdrew from the agency in 1984 because the Reagan administration deemed the organization too susceptible to Moscow’s influence and overly critical of Israel. President George W. Bush pledged in 2002 to rejoin the organization in part to show his willingness for international cooperation in the lead-up to the Iraq war. Cultural organizations in the United States criticized the decision, saying Unesco played a key role in preserving vital cultural heritage worldwide. “Although Unesco may be an imperfect organization, it has been an important leader and steadfast partner in this crucial work,” said Daniel H. Weiss, the president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Ms. Bokova said she had repeatedly told members of Congress that immediate payment of the arrears was not an issue, only American political re-engagement in the organization, which she said she believed served many American interests abroad. Ms. Bokova, in a telephone interview, said she “thought the decision was coming but why now, I don’t know, in the midst of elections” for a new director to succeed her. France and Qatar were running neck-and-neck in the race to lead the cultural body after a third round of voting Wednesday whittled the field to five. Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari of Qatar and Audrey Azoulay of France — both former culture ministers — had 18 votes each. Behind them in the secret ballot was an Egyptian career diplomat, Moushira Khattab, with 13 votes, and Tang Qian of China with five, according to results posted on Unesco’s website. Ms. Bokova argued that Unesco is “so relevant to the political agenda of the American government it’s incredible,” citing its work on trying to prevent violent extremism through educational and cultural programs in the developing world. Unesco’s largest literacy program is in Afghanistan, she said, and Unesco is also working in Libya and Iraq to train teachers and preserve cultural heritage in liberated areas. It has always worked against anti-Semitism and to preserve the memory of the Holocaust, Ms. Bokova said. Analysts said that withdrawing from the organization was a significant escalation by the United States in its criticism of United Nations bodies. “This is another example of the Trump’s administration’s profound ambivalence and concern about the way the U.N. is structured and behaves,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator and adviser in Republican and Democratic administrations. In July, Unesco declared the ancient and hotly contested core of Hebron, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as a Palestinian World Heritage site in danger, a decision sharply criticized by Israel and its allies. And in 2015, Unesco adopted a resolution that criticized Israel for mishandling heritage sites in Jerusalem and condemned “Israeli aggressions and illegal measures against freedom of worship.” The Trump administration has made the defense of Israel on the global stage a key tenet of its foreign policy. After he was elected but before he became president, Mr. Trump made an extraordinary intervention on the world stage by criticizing the Obama administration’s decision not to block a United Nations resolution criticizing Israeli settlements. Mr. Trump has pledged to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and selected a pro-settlement ambassador. Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador, has repeatedly criticized the United Nations for what she called its anti-Israel bias. In a statement released Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel praised the move by the United States and pledged to withdraw Israel from the organization as well. “This is a courageous and ethical decision because Unesco has become a theater of the absurd and instead of preserving history, distorts it,” Mr. Netanyahu said. For President Trump and for Mr. Netanyahu, the recognition of World Heritage sites in the Palestinian territories, like Hebron and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and the 2015 resolution and another in 2016, showed an anti-Israel bias. The 2016 resolution condemned Israel’s “escalating aggressions” regarding a holy site in Jerusalem’s Old City, known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount. It was submitted by the Palestinians, was supported by 24 countries, with six opposing it and 26 abstaining. It referred to the holy site only using Muslim names and prompted angry reactions from Israeli politicians.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Works to Keep Palestinians’ Talks on Track to Aid Peace,"JERUSALEM — With Egypt brokering a reconciliation between the two rival Palestinian factions, President Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East visited Cairo on Thursday to help move those talks along while trying to ensure that the Egyptians do not take them in a direction unacceptable to the United States and Israel. Hamas, the militant Islamic group that seized power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 and has run it ever since, agreed in Cairo last week to return administrative control of the impoverished coastal territory to the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas. The Oct. 12 agreement calls for the Palestinian Authority to lift sanctions that it imposed on Gaza this year to pressure Hamas by cutting electricity supplies to a few hours a day and slashing payment of government salaries. Hamas, in turn, is to give the authority control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, opening up a critical lifeline for imports and for outside travel. But the pact was really an agreement to start talking: The more troublesome issues between Hamas and Mr. Abbas’s Fatah faction — including the merger of two separate work forces in Gaza, and what is to become of the estimated 25,000 Hamas fighters, their arsenal of rockets and network of tunnels — were left for later. For the Trump administration, which has hopes of achieving a grand Israeli-Palestinian bargain, Egypt’s efforts with Hamas and Fatah provided a potentially crucial opening to solve the problem of Gaza, which many see as a prerequisite to reviving the peace process. A key question is whether the talks in Cairo will give Hamas, which the United States designates as a terrorist organization, influence over a consolidated Palestinian government of both the West Bank and Gaza Strip — and how much. The United States envoy, Jason D. Greenblatt, warned before his one-day trip to Cairo that any Palestinian government “must unambiguously and explicitly commit” to nonviolence, peaceful negotiations, recognition of the State of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations — including those that would disarm terrorists. “If Hamas is to play any role in a Palestinian government, it must accept these basic requirements,” Mr. Greenblatt said. Israel and the United States would both welcome Mr. Abbas’s regaining control of Gaza, if only to avert what aid groups and the United Nations had called an emerging humanitarian and health crisis, as disease spread and the pumping of raw sewage into the Mediterranean began to disrupt water plants along Israel’s own coast. For Egypt, the motivation for brokering the talks goes well beyond the good will derived from diplomacy. The Egyptians are eager to secure the Rafah border as part of a broader effort to halt weapons smuggling into Sinai, where they are fighting an Islamic State affiliate. But while a rapprochement between Hamas and Mr. Abbas’s Fatah faction, which dominates the Palestinian Authority, poses the tantalizing prospect of a united Palestinian front facing Israel in potential peace talks, a unity government involving Hamas could violate congressional rules against funding terrorist organizations. That, in turn, could cause the Trump administration to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid to the Palestinians. A similar deal between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in 2011 prompted threatened funding cuts. Speaking at a ceremony marking 100 years since the death of a Zionist heroine, the Jewish spy Sarah Aaronsohn, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel commended Mr. Greenblatt’s statement. “We want peace,” he said. “We want a genuine peace, and because of this we will not conduct negotiations with a terrorist organization in diplomatic disguise.” Notably, Israeli statements on the Palestinian reconciliation effort, including Mr. Netanyahu’s latest, appear to leave narrow but perceptible wiggle room for reaching an accommodation. Mr. Netanyahu’s vow not to “conduct negotiations with a terrorist organization” ignored that Israel had done precisely that a quarter century ago. In 1993, Israel reached a historic agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel had long considered a terrorist group, and which, unlike the Palestinian Authority, remains its official negotiating partner. Under the reconciliation effort, the Palestinian Authority’s ministers who are resuming their functions in Gaza are technocrats who were installed as part of a 2014 national consensus government, to which Israel and the United States do not object, given that the ministers include no Hamas members. This time around, Hamas has so far refused to consider disarming its fighters and has insisted that it remains dedicated to liberating Palestine, not embracing Mr. Abbas’s project of a two-state solution — despite a new document of principles it released in the spring that accepted the idea of a provisional Palestinian state, without renouncing future claims to the land that is now Israel. Yehya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, sounded a typically fierce note on Thursday: “The time has passed when Hamas is discussing the issue of recognizing Israel,” he told a group of Gaza youths, according to the Hamas-affiliated Shehab News Agency’s Arabic-language Facebook page. “Now the debate is over when we wipe out Israel.” “No one can disarm us,” he added. Still, Mr. Greenblatt’s presence in Egypt on Thursday suggested that the United States sees the Fatah-Hamas talks as a chance, however slim, to at least move Hamas in the direction of disarming and embracing the peace process. The militant stance by Hamas leaders poses a problem not only for Israel and the United States, but also for Mr. Abbas, who has vowed not to let Gaza morph into a Lebanon-like situation, where, like Hezbollah, Hamas’s heavily armed fighters wield the ultimate veto power over an enfeebled civilian government that bears responsibility for the difficult work of delivering public services.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. and Europe May Collide on Taxing Apple and Amazon,"President Trump and congressional lawmakers are not the only ones interested in collecting taxes on global profits that American corporations are hoarding overseas. European regulators, knee deep in a campaign to stamp out tax avoidance, have their own plans for that money. Last week, for instance, the European Commission billed Amazon for $293 million in unpaid taxes in Luxembourg, arguing that the country’s failure to collect the tax amounted to an illegal state subsidy. It also took Ireland to court for not following up on the $15.2 billion tax bill imposed on Apple last year. “The Europeans are targeting U.S. dollars overseas that the U.S. believes should be taxed here,” said Dave Camp, a former Republican representative from Michigan who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the author of an unsuccessful tax overhaul in 2014. “We have to address this problem before the Europeans get there first.” The rulings on Amazon and Apple — which those companies are disputing — are byproducts of a race among governments to lure corporate giants to their shores in the hunt for new sources of revenue. That cutthroat competition is the reason that 73 percent of Fortune 500 companies have a subsidiary in a low-tax haven, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. (Their latest report, done in conjunction with the United States Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, was released on Tuesday.) That rivalry has the potential to fuel tensions between the United States and its allies. Yet it could turn out that the European crackdown on American multinationals will ultimately help — rather than hobble — Washington’s efforts to get them to pay up. The harder that other countries make it for American companies to take advantage of tax havens and sweetheart deals abroad, the weaker the incentives are for businesses to stash money out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. Republican leaders have already put at the center of their tax rewrite an idea borrowed from Europe and other countries: Replace the system of taxing the worldwide profits of a domestic corporation with one that taxes only profits earned within its own territory. “If we don’t move to a more modern system, we may lose the ability to gain that revenue,” Mr. Camp warned. Multinationals will inevitably shop around for low rates. Americans and foreign companies have all played the same games, shifting patents and copyrights, profits and royalties to places with no or low corporate tax rates, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. (The I.R.S. itself went after Amazon over assets it transferred to a Luxembourg unit, but Amazon ultimately prevailed.) Efforts to cooperate have not always been successful, but there are signs that coordination can help. The Europeans’ effort is gradually shutting down the most notorious tax dodges that route corporate cash through Ireland and Luxembourg, said Michael J. Graetz, a professor and tax specialist at Columbia Law School. “Those are like dinosaurs,” he said. “They’re moving towards extinction.” And a new rule adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, requiring multinationals to report their income and tax bill in each country, will make it easier for the more than 60 governments that have signed on to monitor how much is actually collected. So far, the team of Trump administration officials and lawmakers who drew up the latest framework for rewriting the tax code has released mostly general principles. Now the I.R.S. taxes the worldwide profits of American corporations, but the tax kicks in only after that income is repatriated to the United States. As a result, American multinationals simply don’t bring much of it home. Republicans have made clear they intend to switch to taxing only profits earned within the United States, what’s known as a territorial system. The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations. The $2.6 trillion in foreign profits that corporations already parked overseas in order to escape paying the I.R.S. would be required to be repatriated — although taxed at a steep discount. And there are promises to prevent the tax base from shrinking, and discourage businesses from putting more operations and earnings overseas. At the same time, the official corporate rate would be slashed to 20 percent, from 35 percent, to make American companies more competitive with their foreign rivals. But this frame still lacks a picture, missing the details of how to accomplish those ambitious if sometimes conflicting goals. Without tough safeguards, for example, the shift away from a worldwide system could end up curbing rather than promoting investment at home as American companies move even more operations overseas to avoid paying any United States taxes. To some experts, like Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College, the only way to prevent American companies from exploiting loopholes in a new territorial regime is with a minimum tax. If a company’s tax rate fell below the floor in, say, Bermuda, it would have to pay the difference to the I.R.S. Other experts, though, suggest borrowing another idea to broaden the tax base from foreign tax regulators — like more aggressive efforts to tax foreign multinationals. As the Amazon and Apple cases show, “the politics in Europe are to tax somebody else’s multinationals, particularly ours,” said Mr. Graetz of Columbia. “All of these other countries are basically trying to beef up and protect their tax base by ensuring foreign multinationals pay tax on income earned in their country,” he added, “and not on income earned by their own domestic multinationals.” This is a different tack from the one taken in the United States, where tax dodges by homegrown billion-dollar corporations have been criticized for increasing the tax burden on companies that can’t shield assets. The complaint that the American tax code favors foreign multinationals over domestic ones did, however, arouse interest last week at Senate hearings on a tax overhaul. “The United States corporate and international tax rules are an anticompetitive mess,” said Itai Grinberg, a law professor at Georgetown University. And one of their most senseless features, he added, is the tax advantage that permits foreign-owned corporations to artificially strip out their earnings in the United States. Both he and Bret Wells, a law professor at the University of Houston, testified that foreign and American companies should be treated the same way. Leveling the playing field does not necessarily have to wait for a rewritten tax code. Adam Looney, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at the Treasury Department, said the Trump administration could take a step now. He urged the president to reverse a decision to delay an Obama-era regulation to limit foreign companies’ tax advantages and prevent them from transferring out their earnings. “Without the regulations, American-owned businesses will be worse off,” while foreign multinationals avoid about $7.4 billion in United States taxes, Mr. Looney wrote this week in a policy brief for the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. The delay, he said, means that the United States is, in effect, paying “foreign investors to take over our companies with our own tax dollars.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. and Turkey Try to Prevent a Diplomatic Dispute From Growing,"ISTANBUL — First, the United States and Turkey temporarily stopped issuing visas to each other’s citizens. Then the Turkish lira plunged on international markets, and most travel between the two countries was curtailed. By midday Monday, fears rose that a minor diplomatic dispute threatened to flare up into a full diplomatic standoff. But by evening, both sides seemed to be taking steps to ease tensions. “This decision is very sad before anything else,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey told journalists at a news briefing during a visit to Kiev, Ukraine, sounding a rare conciliatory note. “It is regrettable that the U.S. ambassador in Ankara took such a decision.” In a statement a few hours later, the American ambassador, John R. Bass, said: “This was not a decision we took lightly. It’s a decision we took with great sadness.” In Turkey, the Foreign Ministry called for an end to the visa suspension because it was causing “unnecessary victimization,” the Turkish state news agency, Anadolu, reported. The confrontation is taking place against a backdrop of deteriorating relations between Turkey and the United States, NATO allies who are at odds over a number of issues: American support for Kurdish fighters in Syria; calls by Turkey for the extradition of a cleric in the United States who it says was behind a failed coup last year; and Turkey’s tilt toward Russia in the war in Syria. The visa suspension came on Sunday evening, after a Turkish employee of the American Consulate in Istanbul was arrested amid reports that another consulate employee was being sought by Turkish authorities. The Turks accused the employee, Metin Topuz, of having links to the wanted cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who is living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. The United States Embassy said Sunday that it would suspend the processing of all nonimmigrant visas while it reassessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of its staff. Students, business travelers, tourists and diplomats all travel on such visas. Within hours, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced similar measures in the United States, adding that the suspension included electronic visas and visas bought at the border — the way most tourists and other short-term visitors enter the country. The United States ambassador, in his statement, said the embassy had not been able to learn of the reasons for Mr. Topuz’s arrest or of the evidence held against him. “The arrest has raised questions about whether the goal of some officials is to disrupt the longstanding cooperation between Turkey and the United States,” the ambassador’s statement said. The measures, which threaten to create chaos for Americans flying into Turkey, do not appear to have been enforced at the border so far. Investors were spooked nevertheless. The lira dropped more than 4 percent against the dollar on Asian markets, news agencies reported. “It is a pretty serious historic crisis,” said Soner Cagaptay, a research fellow at the Washington Institute and the author of a book on Mr. Erdogan, “The New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey.” “Washington gave Erdogan the benefit of the doubt for the last 15 years of his many diplomatic transgressions, but this is different,” Mr. Cagaptay said. The United States was so upset about the arrests of its local staff members because they are vital to providing the technical and contextual support in diplomatic missions, he said. Mr. Topuz was formally arrested on charges of espionage, trying to overthrow the government and acting against the Constitution. His address was printed in a pro-government newspaper, Sabah. Another employee, at the consulate in Adana, Turkey, was arrested in March over similar accusations, but his case has not yet come to trial. Both men appear to have been charged in part because of ties developed with former security officials in the course of their work — raising questions about the safety of all local employees of American diplomatic missions in Turkey. Turkey’s decision to welcome the leaders of Iran and Venezuela in recent weeks has also upset the United States, Mr. Cagaptay said, as has Mr. Erdogan’s abandonment of democratic standards as he imposed a state of emergency after last year’s failed coup and then sought greater powers for the presidency in a referendum in the spring. Turkey has detained dozens of foreign citizens on terrorism charges, including several Americans. It has become increasingly clear that they are seen as potential bargaining chips in Turkey’s efforts to force the extradition of Mr. Gulen. Mr. Erdogan has also expressed anger over the charges brought against 15 of his bodyguards over their use of violence against protesters in Washington in May, and over court cases against a former Turkish cabinet minister and three others in a case of conspiracy to violate sanctions against Iran. President Trump has praised Mr. Erdogan as a stalwart ally in the fight against terrorism. He said last month after a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly that ties between the two countries were “as close as we’ve ever been.” On Monday, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said in an interview on live television that no decision had been made to arrest any other United States employees, dismissing local news reports that prosecutors were preparing to detain another consulate worker. The Istanbul Chief Prosecutor’s Office was quoted on Monday as saying that a worker at the consulate in Istanbul, who was identified only by the initials N.M.C., had been invited to the prosecutor’s office for an interview. The man’s wife and child were taken into custody in the town of Amasya. Two more people were detained in connection with the case of Mr. Topuz, the news channel NTV reported. A United States official said that current visas remained valid, and that Turkish citizens could apply for visas in other countries while services in Turkey were suspended. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day on which the United States and Turkey declared plans to stop processing each other’s nonimmigrant visas. It was on Sunday, not Monday. An earlier version of this article misstated the title of a book written by Soner Cagaptay. It is “The New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey,” not “The Last Sultan.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. to Limit Use of Secrecy Orders That Microsoft Challenged,"The Justice Department will limit its use of secrecy orders that prevent internet providers from telling people when the government has obtained a warrant to read their email during an investigation, according to a department memo issued last week. As a result of the change, Microsoft, which had taken the lead in challenging the department’s practices, said on Monday that it would drop a lawsuit it filed against the government last year. In a blog post Monday night, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, called the change “another important step in ensuring that people’s privacy rights are protected when they store their personal information in the cloud.” Microsoft and other internet companies that supported its lawsuit had raised alarms that the government was using a gag order statute in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 in a way that violated the principles of the First and Fourth Amendments. The First Amendment gives companies the right to speak to their customers, and the Fourth Amendment gives people the right to know if the government has searched or seized their property. Technology companies worried that overuse of the statute could jeopardize the trust people had regarding the privacy of their online data, potentially undermining the growth of cloud computing services. Microsoft’s chief complaint was that the government was using the gag orders on a routine basis and in some cases making them indefinite, in essence preventing Microsoft from ever telling its customers that their data had been retrieved. During one 18-month period, Microsoft found that 68 percent of the legal demands from the federal government that came with secrecy orders required the company to remain silent on them indefinitely. In a memorandum on Oct. 19, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, told department lawyers that the secrecy orders should “have an appropriate factual basis and each should extend only as long as necessary to satisfy the government’s interest.” Except under exceptional circumstances, the memorandum said federal prosecutors could seek a delay in notice of one year or less to a person whose communications had been obtained. “This update further ensures that the department can protect the rights of citizens we serve, while allowing companies to maintain relationships with their customers by notifying those suspected of crimes, or believed to have information relevant to a crime, in a timely manner that information was obtained relating to their user accounts,” Lauren Ehrsam, a department spokeswoman, said by email. In the blog post, Mr. Smith of Microsoft wrote: “This is an important step for both privacy and free expression. It is an unequivocal win for our customers, and we’re pleased the DOJ has taken these steps to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S.-Backed Fighters Take Largest Syrian Oil Field From ISIS,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — United States-backed militia fighters seized Syria’s largest oil field from the Islamic State on Sunday, according to the militia, narrowly beating pro-government forces to an area critical to the war-torn country’s economy. Although it is unclear what the capacity of the oil field is today, after years of airstrikes by the coalition on the Islamic State’s makeshift oil operations, its capture is a major blow to the militant group, which is losing both territory and sources of revenue. The militants were driven last week from the Syrian city of Raqqa, once the de facto capital of their self-declared caliphate, and are now struggling to hold onto their last significant territory in Syria, mostly in the neighboring province of Deir al-Zour along the Iraqi border. Islamic State fighters are being squeezed between two fronts there, with two rival international coalitions advancing on them from different directions: the Syrian government, backed by Russia and Iran; and the American-backed group, called the Syrian Democratic Forces, which took the oil field. Those two groups are racing to take over strategic territory as the Islamic State loses ground, to better position themselves in the next chapter of Syria’s multilayered war. Conflicts remain in Syria — and will continue even if the Islamic State is defeated — between Mr. Assad’s government and an array of mostly Arab rebels, as well as Kurdish groups that have carved out a zone of relative autonomy in northeastern Syria during the war. The Omar oil field that was seized on Sunday is a major prize in that competition. Local witnesses, as well as conflict monitoring groups, said that pro-government forces had been within a few miles of the oil field but retreated after heavy attacks by the Islamic State. Now that the Syrian Democratic Forces has seized the oil field, it could find itself facing pro-government forces across a front line, increasing the risk of a clash between them or between their international backers. The American-backed coalition and the Russia-Iran coalition have previously accused each another of firing on their proxy forces in the area. Pro-government news outlets denied that the S.D.F. had taken control of the oil field, and said fighting was continuing. In the past, they have accused the United States of using the Islamic State as a de facto ally against its enemies — an accusation also leveled against the government when the Islamic State has attacked rival opposition fighters. It is unclear how long the S.D.F. — a Kurdish-led group that has managed in recent months to attract a more diverse coalition, including Arabs and Assyrians — can maintain control over its areas. The Trump administration does not appear to have a plan to reconstruct the areas or defend them for long after the battle against Islamic State ends. Without United States air support for the rebels, the Syrian government is likely to retake the territory. The government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, controls around 60 percent of the country and has vowed to retake the rest of it. Still, a Kurdish official, reached by phone in Qamishli, a Kurdish-controlled city in the northeast, was ecstatic. Speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss politics, he noted that the S.D.F. now controls Syria’s largest hydroelectric dams and oil fields as well as sprawling gas fields and agricultural lands. That, he said, could give Kurds and their allies leverage to get a seat at the table in any future peace talks. Up to now, they have not been recognized as a party to the long-stymied talks held in Geneva between the Syrian government and a coalition recognized by the United States and its allies as the sole representative of the Syrian opposition. The capture of the Omar oil field could also be an economic boon for the area controlled by the S.D.F. Fuel already sells in its territories at a fraction of the cost as in government-held areas. Now, the Kurdish official said, the local administration could sell the oil not only in its own territory, but also in other areas that Mr. Assad does not control, enlarging its economic base. A member of an Arab tribe who fled his home in the eastern Syrian city of Mayadeen this month when fighting intensified between the Islamic State and government forces there, and who requested anonymity to avoid reprisals, said he hoped the S.D.F. and Kurds would be more equitable with the reserves than the Syrian government had been. The man, Riad, a schoolteacher, said the government had given local Sunni Arab tribe members like himself mainly low-level jobs, saving well-paid ones for government cronies and leaving locals to deal with the environmental problems from the industry. He said that pro-government forces had looted his city when they retook it from the Islamic State. Although he said he did not completely trust the Kurds, he said that at least the S.D.F. had some local tribesmen among its fighters, so the area could get some benefits.",The New York Times
2017,U.S.-Puerto Rico Basketball Game to Be Moved Because of Hurricane Damage,"The devastation wreaked by Hurricane Maria will force Puerto Rico to move its World Cup basketball qualifying game next month against the United States, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. Talks between the Puerto Rican national basketball federation and U.S.A. Basketball to move the game to Orlando, Fla., were continuing as of Monday afternoon, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly before a resolution was complete. Central Florida is home to an estimated 350,000 Puerto Ricans, which makes Orlando an inviting venue. Puerto Rico was scheduled to face the Americans at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan on Nov. 23 — Thanksgiving Day — but that facility is now being used as a command center for volunteer and municipality relief efforts. Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico said last week that 91 percent of the island was without power and projected that 75 percent would still be without power in a month. Puerto Rico’s game against the United States will be the first for both countries under the sport’s new World Cup qualifying format. Based on the soccer-style qualifying structure adopted by the sport’s international governing body, known as FIBA, for the 2019 World Cup, countries will participate in six windows of two qualifiers each in their geographic region from November through February 2019. Via those 12 games, which are divided into two rounds, 31 nations will qualify for the World Cup in 2019 alongside host China. But in basketball, unlike soccer, top players will not be released by their teams for national-team duty on so-called international breaks, meaning that every country in the competition with N.B.A. players will be forced to try to qualify without the use of its best athletes. The United States, coached by the TV analyst and former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, is expected to rely on a roster filled with N.B.A. development league players. It will host Mexico on Nov. 26 in Greensboro, N.C., after the Puerto Rico game, to complete the first qualifying window. After its November date against the United States, Puerto Rico is not scheduled to play at home again until late June 2018, with qualifiers scheduled against Cuba (June 28) and Mexico (July 1) after two games on the road in February. But it is not yet known how soon the Puerto Ricans can realistically expect to stage a home game. Maria’s impact prompted Oklahoma City Thunder forward Carmelo Anthony — whose father is Puerto Rican and still has family on the island — to start a YouCaring donation drive aimed at raising $1 million. The Carmelo Anthony Puerto Rico Relief Fund, as of Monday afternoon, had raised nearly $315,000. Dallas Mavericks guard J. J. Barea, Puerto Rico’s lone active N.B.A. player, started a similar YouCaring campaign with his wife, the actress and model Viviana Ortiz, that is approaching $235,000 in collections en route to their goal of raising $300,000 for hurricane victims. Barea has joined with the Mavericks’ owner, Mark Cuban, to arrange four recent trips to Puerto Rico — using the team’s plane — to deliver relief aid and supplies to those in need. Barea took leave from the Mavericks to join his wife and several friends on two of the convoys. “There’s a big group of Latinos, as you know, in Dallas and in Texas that gathered a lot of stuff,” Barea said. “And when I say a lot of stuff — four to six eighteen-wheelers full of stuff. Generators, water, food, medicine, all kind of donations. We filled up every plane.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S.-Turkey Visa Standoff Disrupts Business and Tourism,"ISTANBUL — Americans planning an impromptu visit to Istanbul have been turned back. Board members of one school have had to postpone meetings. A Turkish entrepreneur, after spending two years setting up a business in New York, finds herself in limbo, her visa appointment canceled. The cases, though apparently relatively few, signal the potential for deeper disruptions since the United States and Turkey suspended visa services two weeks ago in a tit-for-tat dispute over Turkey’s detention of United States consular employees. This week, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan R. Cohen devoted a whole day to trying to resolve the dispute during a visit to Turkey, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey expressed a desire to end the disagreement. But it appears far from over. Alarmed at the arrest of two of its locally employed consular staff and the detention of the wife and daughter of a third employee, American officials are demanding assurances that its staff members will not be arrested for carrying out United States business. They are also demanding that those already arrested be released unless Turkey can provide compelling evidence against them. Until then, things remain frozen. Both countries have allowed travelers visas on humanitarian grounds, and people holding existing visas can travel, but a few Americans have been refused entry at Istanbul airport, and more have had to cancel their trips. “It is having some impact on people’s plans for the mid- to long-term,” said Matthew Bryza, a former United States ambassador and chief executive of Lamor Corporation in Turkey. He criticized the visa ban as the wrong tool, but said he was buoyed by the restraint in the language used by both sides to seek a resolution. Thousands of Turks have had to suspend their plans, too. The visa shops and cafes lining the street opposite the United States Consulate in Istanbul were closed this week. A lone man typing in his office said there were no appointments at the consulate, so no business. Up to 10,000 Turks a month are granted nonimmigrant visas to visit the United States, according to State Department figures, and 113,064 were granted in all of 2016. Nearly half a million Americans traveled to Turkey in 2016. A fashion promoter was set to have her interview this week for an entrepreneur’s visa but was informed by email that her interview had been canceled. She asked that her name not be published but said she was dismayed that after two years of work and $100,000 of investment in an office in Manhattan’s trendy SoHo district, she faced new legal requirements and more paperwork reapplying in a third country. Relations between Turkey and the United States have been strained since last year’s failed coup, which Turkey blames on Fethullah Gulen, an Islamist cleric who lives in self-imposed exile on a large estate in Pennsylvania. Turkey has been upset by the United States’ perceived reluctance to extradite Mr. Gulen — the United States says Turkey has not provided evidence that would convince a federal judge — and by the United States’ arming of Kurdish forces in Syria, which Turkey fears will strengthen Kurdish separatists in Turkey. The United States has been alarmed at the backsliding of democracy in Turkey in recent years under Mr. Erdogan and the mass arrests conducted since the failed coup that have even swept up a dozen United States citizens, some of whom have been in jail for over a year, and two longstanding Turkish employees of United States Consulates. Hamza Ulucay, an employee with more than 30 years’ service at the United States Consulate in Adana, in southeastern Turkey, was arrested in March, accused of having ties to a terrorist organization. He is in jail awaiting a formal indictment. Two weeks ago, Metin Topuz, who has worked at the Istanbul consulate for the Drug Enforcement Administration for over 20 years, was arrested on similar charges. Days after his arrest, the Istanbul police searched the home of a third employee, Mete Canturk, who has also worked for years at the Istanbul consulate. He was not at home at the time, and officers then visited his wife’s family home in northern Turkey and detained his wife and daughter, who were attending the funeral of his wife’s father. The recent detentions prompted the United States visa suspension, an unexpected and drastic action that seems to have halted the arrest of a third employee. Since the suspension, the Turkish police have not pursued Mr. Canturk, who has continued to work every day at the consulate. But his wife and daughter were detained for more than a week in Amasya. They were released Monday evening on the eve of the arrival of Mr. Cohen, the State Department official, but remain under judicial control and cannot leave the country. The American action followed a similar turn in German-Turkish relations several months ago, when Germany reacted to the arrests of several Germans in Turkey by threatening economic sanctions and restricting support for Turkey’s application for membership in the European Union. Turkish officials have indicated that they want the visa suspension to end. “I don’t think that this is a problem that will drag on,” Mr. Erdogan said on Thursday. “This delegation is here to finish it. The talks are ongoing. My wish is for a result as soon as possible, leave the visa issue behind and that relations return to its normal situation.” Yet, in other comments later the same day to a gathering of party supporters, Mr. Erdogan continued to rail against United States policy, in particular at perceived American reluctance to extradite Mr. Gulen. “They think we are strategic partners and that we will obey everything,” he said of American officials. “Now they are asking me to give them some people. But first you should give me the one in the ranch,” a reference to Mr. Gulen and his Pennsylvania home. Going into talks Wednesday, Mr. Cohen told Turkish journalists that the United States was seeking assurances that Turkey would not detain consular employees for contacts made in the normal course of their work, and that it wanted the arrested employees to be released or to be shown compelling evidence of their wrongdoing. Turkish officials have concentrated on lifting the visa ban, suggesting that it would be resolved soon but offering no promises on the detainees. “We will cooperate if their demands meet the rules of our constitution,” Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said at a news briefing Wednesday. “But we will not succumb to impositions, and we will reject any conditions that we cannot meet.” A senior presidential adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, later said that the visa ban would be resolved soon, but that details discussed would have to be referred back to Washington first. By the fourth day of Mr. Cohen’s visit to Turkey, there was no announcement of an agreement. An article on Saturday about a diplomatic dispute between the United States and Turkey misspelled the name of a Turkish city where a consulate employee’s wife and daughter were detained for more than a week. It is Amasya, not Asmaya.",The New York Times
2017,Uber C.E.O. Aims to Win Back London,"LONDON — Less than two weeks after being stripped of its license in London, Uber has gone on a charm offensive to win it back. Even as the ride-hailing company’s board grappled with internal divisions and a major investment hung in the balance, the company’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, flew to the British capital, its biggest European market, to hold talks with the city’s transport chief on Tuesday. After the meeting, Mr. Khosrowshahi tweeted a picture of himself with more than a dozen smiling Uber drivers, writing, “Determined to make things right in this great city!” There had been much hype ahead of the talks, but neither side gave much away. Uber and Transport for London, which oversees much of the city’s public transport system, issued separate brief statements after the meeting between Mr. Khosrowshahi and Mike Brown, London’s transport commissioner. Both described the talks as “constructive” and said they would have further discussions in “the coming weeks.” Mr. Khosrowshahi visited London as the company he was chosen to lead just weeks ago continued to grapple with a new set of issues. Uber’s board is considering proposals to limit the power of its co-founder and former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, as it courts a major new investment. The push to win back London is also part of a wider effort to move past Mr. Kalanick’s often-combative style and change Uber’s reputation from ruthless disrupter to responsible corporate citizen. No one expects a quick resolution to the dispute between Uber and Transport for London. The regulator revoked Uber’s taxi license last month, citing an array of issues in deciding that the company was not “fit and proper” to operate in the city. Uber’s appeal of the ban could take months to resolve, and even if the company lost a second appeal, it could take the case to the highest court in the country. It can continue to operate in London throughout that process. In the meantime, the ruling has highlighted divisions within the city. Critics are led chiefly by London’s black-cab drivers. They must earn their licenses by memorizing 100,000 landmarks across 25,000 streets in London, an extremely difficult test known as The Knowledge. They argue that Uber drivers are underregulated and that the service systematically underprices competitors to win customers. A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder. “Their entire business model is based on predatory pricing,” said Steve McNamara of the powerful Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, which represents the British capital’s centuries-old black-cab sector. “Uber wants to undercut competitors, establish a monopoly and then raise prices when they have a monopoly.” Supporters of Uber, however, are plentiful. The company has garnered nearly 850,000 signatures for a Change.org petition called “Save Your Uber in London.” Proponents argue that satellite navigation has rendered The Knowledge obsolete, that black cabs are too expensive and that Uber’s detailed tracking of drivers enhances passenger safety. That most black-cab drivers are white, native-born Britons and many Uber drivers are immigrants serves only to complicate matters. Meetings between Uber and Transport for London have long been controversial affairs. Under Mr. Kalanick, Uber responded to regulators’ concerns by mobilizing consumers to drown them out and by lobbying politicians at the highest level. When the previous mayor of London, Boris Johnson, a Conservative, tried to clamp down on Uber two years ago, he was told to stand down by the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, and his chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, also Conservatives. One of Mr. Cameron’s senior advisers at the time, Steve Hilton, is married to Rachel Whetstone, who was the head of communications for Uber. The couple are godparents to one of Mr. Cameron’s children. The meetings often took place at 10 Downing Street and were chaired by Daniel Korski, Mr. Cameron’s technology adviser. If there have been changes at the highest level at Uber, the dynamics in London have changed, too. The new mayor, Sadiq Khan, is a member of the opposition Labour Party and not beholden to the Conservative government of Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Cameron’s successor. For Uber, the London ban is but one of several headaches around the world that the company’s leadership must confront. While Mr. Khosrowshahi is on his diplomacy mission, Uber’s board is scheduled to discuss proposals that would limit Mr. Kalanick’s power. That meeting will include two new directors named by Mr. Kalanick late last week, a surprise move that escalated tensions with other board members. The proposals are tentatively linked to a pending $10 billion investment in the company from a group led by SoftBank of Japan, a potential deal that Uber’s board has worked on for weeks. It is a sign of the importance of the London ban that, even with Uber’s board meeting set to take place, Mr. Khosrowshahi flew here to meet with the authorities. With 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers, the city is Uber’s biggest market in Europe, and one of its largest in the world. “London is the Champions League of transportation,” Mr. Kalanick told the British newspaper City A.M. three years ago, referring to a top European soccer tournament. “It has got a more dynamic, more competitive transportation system than any other city in the world.” The effort on Tuesday is meant to show that Uber is adopting a more conciliatory approach to working with cities. Such a change in attitude is important as Uber continues to expand globally and justify its sky-high $68.5 billion valuation ahead of an initial public offering that Mr. Khosrowshahi has said could come in 2019. There are plenty of challenges, though. The company’s most senior executive based here, Jo Bertram, recently resigned. And elsewhere, Uber continues to face pressure from both governments and competitors. It gave up its ambitions to expand in China last year when it sold its operations there to a venture run by Didi Chuxing, a homegrown rival. It also sold its Russian business this summer to a new joint venture run by its main competitor in that country, Yandex. Uber has also faced criticism over the treatment of its drivers. Last month, the company appealed a British court decision in which judges ruled that Uber drivers should be classified and treated as employees. The company argues that its drivers are self-employed contractors. That claim has come in for scrutiny from Europe’s highest court as well. Any shift in how Uber treats its employees would have wide-reaching implications not just for the company but also for the so-called gig economy, forcing “on demand” businesses to offer workers the payments, protections and benefits that full-time employees are typically entitled to. Notably, however, Transport for London’s ruling revoking Uber’s license here made no mention of the company’s labor practices. “It’s absolutely extraordinary that workers’ rights have not come into it,” said Caroline Russell, a Green Party member of the London Assembly, a mini-legislature that scrutinizes City Hall.",The New York Times
2017,"Uber, Surging Outside Manhattan, Tops Taxis in New York City","Taxi or Uber? It is not even a question for Samantha Forrest, 22, a single mother who sees so few taxis that she does not consider them an option. There is only Uber when she is late for her cashier’s job, lugging groceries home, or going to the doctor with her young son. Ms. Forrest lives in the Soundview neighborhood in the Bronx, a working-class enclave that is one of the fastest-growing bastions of Uber riders in New York City. Uber pickups in the area surged to an average of 6,132 a week in August, from 1,189 the year before. “Uber is everywhere,” Ms. Forrest said. “When I think of cabs, I think of Uber because that’s the main thing to take now.” Uber has deployed thousands of black cars across Manhattan, going bumper-to-bumper with yellow taxis for passengers and fares in lucrative commercial and tourist areas. But the ride-hail app has increasingly shifted its focus to the city’s other four boroughs, where frustration over subway overcrowding and delays and fewer taxi options have made it the ride of choice for many. As a result, Uber is booming in the other boroughs, with half of all Uber rides now starting outside Manhattan — up from one-fourth just two years ago — not including pickups at the city’s two airports in Queens. The growth has been so explosive that it has helped produce a milestone moment — for the first time, more people are using Uber in New York than the city’s fabled yellow cabs. In July, Uber recorded an average of 289,000 rides each day compared with 277,000 taxi trips. While some of this growth is in freshly gentrified outposts filled with millennials and families priced out of Manhattan, it is also happening in more diverse neighborhoods, including some poor and minority areas that have long been shunned by yellow taxis. “It gives safe transportation to people in communities where the cabs don’t stop, where the color of your skin prohibits you from access,” said the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, 68, who is African-American and a senior pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Westchester County. Many of his church members live in the city, and now arrive for service in Uber cars. Reverend Richardson said that drivers of yellow taxis have sometimes refused to pick him up because they assume the worst about blacks — that they will rob a driver or jump out without paying. He said he has yet to be turned away by an Uber driver. (Nonetheless, Uber and other ride-hailing apps have been accused in other cities of refusing service to African-Americans.) Uber has showered the boroughs with “neighborhood love” promotions such as free rides, $5 car pools within each borough and free pizza just for showing the Uber app. It has also opened driver support and recruitment centers, called “Greenlight Hubs,” in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, while closing its only one in Manhattan this year. Much as it has done to New York’s yellow cabs, Uber’s popularity is coming at the expense of livery cars and green taxis that operate in northern Manhattan and the other boroughs. Uber closely guards its ride data, but agreed to provide The New York Times with recent numbers that show its service expanding rapidly in 50 sample residential areas in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and on Staten Island with limited access to public transportation. Uber made a total of 167,194 weekly pickups in these areas in August, nearly triple the 56,721 weekly pickups from the year before. A similar pattern has emerged in other cities, including San Francisco, Chicago and Houston, with the demand for Uber service initially concentrated in the downtown or central business district and then spreading to outlying neighborhoods and suburbs. This has helped Uber continue building ridership amid a series of high-profile missteps and scandals that have provoked widespread condemnation and incited a global backlash against the company, with some riders deleting the app in protest. In a significant setback, London declined to renew Uber’s operating license, declaring that the company was not sufficiently “fit and proper.” For many passengers, though, the bottom line is that Uber gets them where they need to go. Leo Martinez, 30, a sales agent who has taken Uber around Queens, said that while she has heard the concerns about Uber, what matters most to her is that it is cheap — usually less than $10 a ride — fast and reliable. “Every single company has complaints,” she said. “It’s not just Uber.” More than half of the 50 sample areas with increased Uber pickups were in Queens, a sprawling borough where many residents live far from the subway. In St. Albans, weekly pickups rose to 6,370 from 1,870 the year before, while neighborhoods including South Jamaica, Laurelton, Springfield Gardens, Rosedale, Bayside and Glendale also saw large increases. In the Flatlands neighborhood in Brooklyn, which has no subway station, there were 13,380 weekly pickups, or nearly four times the 3,598 pickups the previous year. In Starrett City, a vast housing development, weekly pickups rose to 2,261 from 699. Nine areas were on Staten Island, a borough where public transit is sparse, including Port Richmond, New Brighton, Westerleigh and Arden Heights. In the New Springville area, weekly pickups soared to 1,494 from 591. “We really want to make sure we’re fulfilling the needs of New Yorkers wherever they live,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s general manager for the Northeast. “Taxis have long ignored some of these communities.” Mr. Maredia said that Uber complements the public transit system, especially in “transit deserts” outside Manhattan where subway stations and bus stops are far apart. Uber cars ferry riders from their homes to the closest station, or provide a one-way alternative. Other ride-hail apps, like Lyft and Via, are also finding customers beyond Manhattan. Just over half of pickups on Lyft, not including the airports, now come from outside Manhattan. It has stationed its operations staff in Queens, where it also has a driver support center, and hosts monthly social events for drivers in Brooklyn. Lyft is the official rideshare partner of Barclays Center, offering up to $10 off the first two rides to the arena. Other promotions have included 50 percent off 10 rides in the boroughs outside Manhattan. Via, which started in Manhattan, has branched out to Downtown Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights, Williamsburg and Greenpoint, and to Long Island City in Queens. It also has a driver center in Queens, and has dangled a $5.95 flat fee for rides between Brooklyn and Manhattan, $7.95 for rides between Long Island City and Manhattan, and $5 for rides within Brooklyn. Meera Joshi, the commissioner of the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission, said all these new choices have improved the transportation landscape. “More options expand mobility for passengers, and they become a greater part of our city’s social and economic life,” she said. There are about 61,000 black cars providing rides for Uber, though they may also work for the other apps, too. In contrast, yellow taxis are capped at 13,587. Though more for-hire cars means worse traffic in some neighborhoods, Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant who has found that the ride-hail apps contribute to congestion, said that their expansion outside Manhattan was generally positive. “I think the incremental increase in traffic is way overshadowed by the improvement in mobility in these neighborhoods,” he said. Just as the apps have upended the yellow taxi industry, their expansion has hurt the green taxis, which were started in 2013 to serve northern Manhattan and the other boroughs, and neighborhood livery services. Currently, there are 4,251 green taxis on the road; in July, the green taxis provided an average of 29,503 daily rides, down from 42,979 the year before. Sergio Sanchez, who once owned five green taxis, said Uber siphoned off his drivers with hefty signing bonuses and other incentives, and won over riders with heavily discounted rides. “People were standing on the corners waiting for Uber,” he said. “The green taxis were invisible, like they weren’t even there.” Mr. Sanchez said he simply could not compete and his taxis were repossessed by his lenders. He now drives for Via. Some livery services have banded together against the threat from Uber and the others, pooling their cars and creating a unified network to ensure that there is always a car available to pick up a passenger. Jose Altamirano, the president of the Livery Base Owners Association, said that may not be enough if the apps continue to rapidly expand. “If they go up, we’ll go down,” he said. “There’s only so many customers.” The ride-hail apps have not only benefited passengers but also drivers, many of whom are immigrants with few good job options. At the Bronx driver center, which opened in February, 2,000 drivers come through the door every week. Sabrina Ortiz, 28, earns about $800 a week driving for Uber, or twice as much as she did as a receptionist for an auto shop. Another benefit is that she can set her own hours and does not have to check with anyone to stay home if her two children are sick. Ms. Ortiz said that she is aware of Uber’s scandals and strained relations with drivers who have criticized the company for underpaying them and cutting rates so low they cannot make a living. One passenger recently asked, “How can you work for Uber?” “It does kind of bother me,” she said. “But at the end of the day, I haven’t had any experience like that.” Ricardo Peña, 24, who lives in the Bronx, began hopping into Uber cars two years ago because he could not bear another packed bus or subway. Soon he was taking Uber up to 10 times a week. He eventually quit his job as a security guard and went to work for Uber as a driver. “A lot of people need this form of transportation,” he said. “They need the convenience.”",The New York Times
2017,Uber’s Board Approves Changes to Reshape Company’s Power Balance,"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber’s board of directors voted on Tuesday for governance changes that will reshape the balance of power at the ride-hailing service, paving the way for a stock sale to the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and for the company to go public by 2019. The 11-member board met for less than four hours to approve some of the terms from a proposal put forward last week by Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s new chief executive, and Goldman Sachs, the investment bank that is an investor in the privately held company. As a result, the clout of certain Uber shareholders — including, most significantly, its former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, who is a board member — will be reduced, according to people briefed on the deliberations, who asked to remain anonymous because the conversations were confidential. Other proposed measures, including one that would have posed hurdles to Mr. Kalanick’s returning as chief executive, were dropped before the meeting. Still, the board approved enough changes for Uber to move forward on an investment from SoftBank. SoftBank has held discussions to buy a significant chunk of Uber’s stock, but the deal was contingent on changing the company’s governance structure so that some of its early investors would have an incentive to sell. In addition, directors approved a resolution for Uber to go public by 2019, the people briefed on the meeting said, setting up what could be one of the largest technology stock offerings in years. In a statement, Uber’s board said it had “voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by SoftBank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders.” The decisions mean that Uber, valued at nearly $70 billion and closely watched by other start-ups, may have defused — at least temporarily — another fractious situation. Board members have been deeply split for months on many issues, with Uber grappling with numerous scandals over its workplace culture and management. The board’s divisions have partly been rooted in a fractured relationship between Mr. Kalanick and Benchmark, a venture-capital firm that was an early investor in Uber and that holds a board seat. Benchmark helped force out Mr. Kalanick as chief executive in June. Since then, Benchmark and Mr. Kalanick have warred over how much control of Uber he retains. Mr. Kalanick had outsize voting rights at the company under a certain class of Uber stock that he owns, and he controls three board seats under an amendment to the corporate charter that was passed last year. Mr. Kalanick had spent much of the past week pushing back on some of the corporate governance proposals. To gain more leverage on the board, he appointed two additional members, Ursula Burns, a former chief executive of Xerox, and John Thain, a former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, on Friday. Both participated in Tuesday’s board meeting. Several directors, including Ms. Burns and Mr. Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, who was in London trying to regain Uber’s right to operate in that city, dialed in to the meeting, the people briefed on the conversations said. Others, including Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Thain, attended in person. Afterward, Mr. Kalanick struck a conciliatory tone. He said in a statement that the board “came together collaboratively” and that the company’s new governance framework “will serve Uber well.” Specifically, Uber’s board agreed on Tuesday to remove the special voting power carried by two categories of Uber stock, the Class B common shares and the preferred shares. Mr. Kalanick holds about a third of Uber’s Class B common stock, which originally came with 10-to-one voting power. The preferred stock, which also had special voting rights, is held by early venture investors including Benchmark. All of Uber’s shareholders will eventually have one vote per share, regardless of the class of stock that they own. SoftBank’s investment would total about $1 billion to $1.25 billion at Uber’s current valuation of $67.5 billion, the people said. SoftBank also plans to buy some stock from existing Uber shareholders at a lower valuation, they said. SoftBank would be investing in Uber along with co-investors including the investment firm Dragoneer. Still, any deal with SoftBank remains far from finished. Uber must now go through what is known as a tender offer process with SoftBank, which will bid to buy stock from existing shareholders at a discounted valuation. Whatever SoftBank offers to pay must be high enough to get shareholders to sell. And enough shareholders must agree to sell for the conglomerate to receive a 14 percent to 17 percent stake in Uber, or the deal could fall apart. SoftBank declined to comment. The resolution to take Uber public by 2019 is likely to draw scrutiny. Because Uber is widely regarded as the world’s most valuable privately held company, an initial public offering would excite Wall Street and investors worldwide. In addition, Uber’s directors voted to add six new seats to make a 17-member board, the people said. SoftBank would get two of the new seats, with another going to an independent chairman or chairwoman and three going to new independent directors. The board also approved a measure that requires two-thirds board approval for any new chief executive, until after an initial public offering. And in what may be a sign of a potential détente between Mr. Kalanick and Benchmark, the venture capital firm agreed to drop a lawsuit that it had filed against him if the SoftBank investment closes and all the governance changes go into effect, the people said. Yet even as Uber’s board was able to come to an agreement on Tuesday, some shareholders took issue with losing their outsize voting rights. Shervin Pishevar and Steve Russell, who own a combination of Class B common and preferred Uber shares, called the reduction of their voting power to one vote per share “unfair and illegal.” They added that they had “given full authority to our attorneys to pursue any and all legal actions across the globe to bring justice for those wronged by this action.”",The New York Times
2017,Uber’s C.E.O. and More at the DealBook Conference: DealBook Briefing,"Good Monday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We’re following how the health care industry plans to fight back against President Trump’s move to undercut the Affordable Care Act. More on that in a moment. This morning, we’re announcing the speaker lineup for our sixth annual conference. The event, DealBook: Playing for the Long Term, takes place on Nov. 9 at Jazz at Lincoln Center in Manhattan. Andrew will host a series of conversations throughout the day with some of the biggest newsmakers at the intersection of business and policy. Among them: Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber This will be his first public interview since being named C.E.O. at Uber in late August. Expect Mr. Khosrowshahi to speak about the ride-hailing giant’s struggle in London and — perhaps just as daunting — the company’s internal battles. Laurene Powell Jobs, founder, Emerson Collective A rare public interview with one of the most influential women in the worlds of business and philanthropy, whose organization invests in businesses like The Atlantic and the Washington Wizards and in causes like immigration and education.

Will the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback be able to prove that the N.F.L.’s owners have banded together to prevent him from playing? ABC News published the official arbitration claim that Colin Kaepernick has filed against the league. From the filing: Respondents N.F.L. and N.F.L. Team Owners have colluded to deprive Mr. Kaepernick of employment rights in retaliation for Mr. Kaepernick’s leadership and advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equality in the United States. Owners have long denied the claim. What the New York Giants co-owner John Mara said in August: “Anybody that thinks that there’s been any conversations going on among teams about Colin Kaepernick is crazy.” But it’s not an open-and-shut matter. From Mark Maske, WaPo: Legal experts call such cases difficult to prove. Under the [collective bargaining agreement], the mere fact that a player is unsigned does not constitute evidence of collusion. Why this matters • Mr. Kapernick’s protest during the national anthem set off President Trump’s attacks against the league, pitting players against owners and drawing sponsors into the fray. • Players are still protesting. • If N.F.L. owners had hoped for a swift end to the controversy, they’re probably disappointed. On Friday, we asked how the market would react to Mr. Trump’s executive order to end the insurer subsidies that cover low-income people under the Affordable Care Act. The answer: Mr. Trump bragged about his blow against health insurers on — where else? — Twitter: And Steve Bannon went on record to say that the White House move was meant to destroy the Obama health care plan. From Politico: Bannon said Trump’s decision to not continue funding Obamacare subsidies, announced Thursday, was designed to “blow up” the health care law and insurance marketplaces. “Gonna blow those exchanges up, right?” Bannon said. Health insurers — who may have to raise rates or bail out of state insurance markets — are already girding for battle. America’s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association issued a joint statement that included this: Terminating this critical program will do just the opposite. This action will make it harder for patients to access the care they need. Costs will go up and choices will be restricted. The insurers may have backing from Republican politicians who protested the move. • Senator Susan Collins of Maine: “What the president is doing is affecting the ability of vulnerable people to receive health care right now.” • Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida: “@potus promised more access, affordable coverage. This does opposite.” • Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada: “It’s going to hurt everybody.” But the biggest opposition may come from some members of Mr. Trump’s own base. From the A.P.: “Nearly 70 percent of those benefiting from the so-called cost-sharing subsidies live in states Trump won last November, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.” The bottom line Will a coalition of insurers, politicians and voters overturn what Mr. Trump has started? • Jonathan Swan, Axios: As Mr. Trump weighs pulling out of Nafta and the United States trade deal with South Korea, has he become the “deal-breaker in chief?” • The Senate is scheduled to vote tomorrow on starting debate on the 2018 fiscal year budget. What happens when perhaps the most hotly anticipated initial public offering doesn’t take place? That was what deal makers around the world had been wondering as Saudi Aramco weighs a private stock sale instead of an expansive international I.P.O., according to the F.T., citing unidentified people. Reports now say that Aramco probably would list on Riyadh’s Tadawul exchange next year. But the company may pursue a private placement with investors from China and others instead of listing abroad. Who could take a hit? • Aramco’s financial advisers: An army of banks including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Moelis & Company and Evercore Partners had been hoping for huge advisory fees. (The F.T. has more on banks’ hopes for fees from Saudi projects.) • Stock exchanges: The N.Y.S.E. and the L.S.E. had been considered the most likely venues for Aramco’s foreign listing. But exchanges in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Toronto have also been competing for the assignment. • Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: It was the prince who has been pushing for the I.P.O., and who planned to use proceeds to invest on behalf of the kingdom. The official Aramco line: “A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the I.P.O. process remains on track.” What to watch for Whether Saudi officials will say anything at the their government’s Future Investment Initiative conference later this month. (Andrew will attend.) Pundit corner Liam Denning, Bloomberg Gadfly: “If the private option is being considered, then it would represent a stunning retreat.” Harvey Weinstein may be out of the company (and out of the Academy), but there may be bidders for the entity he once co-led. From Ben Fritz and Erich Schwartzel, WSJ: If Weinstein Co. were bought whole and continued to operate, suitors might include hedge funds looking to have a U.S. entertainment asset, a person close to the company said. Another possibility is that Weinstein Co. would be shut down and its library of movies and TV shows and other assets sold in pieces. The Weinstein brother still at the company, Bob, thinks the studio will survive. He told The Hollywood Reporter: “I know they’re saying, ‘Shut this company down.’ Well, they didn’t shut Fox News down, they didn’t shut NBC down. My brother is the one that should pay with everything. He also told the publication that the Weinstein Company wasn’t for sale and that its lenders “gave their support.” But is that enough? Content partners like Apple, CBS, Amazon, and the writer-actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, already have ended, or want to end, projects with the studio.

After pushback, Mr. Grant went on CNBC and apologized for his takedown of the gigantic hedge fund: “Bridgewater is a secretive and eccentric firm and I let my suspicions of that get in the way of our ordinarily comprehensive due diligence.” Mr. Grant’s exposé centered on questions about Bridgewater’s relationship with its auditor, KPMG, and its lack of prime brokers. But Bloomberg’s Matt Levine opined, “Frustratingly, though, none of the oddities [at Bridgewater] are especially odd.” But don’t think that Mr. Grant has become a booster of Ray Dalio’s firm. He still thinks the hedge fund will be a “figurehead of the next crisis”: “I think the nature of its trading will present a difficulty in the next downturn, if that downturn, especially, is characterized by an unscripted rise in interest rates.” The former eBay subsidiary had a market capitalization of $83 billion as of Friday — or 32 times forward earnings — according to Peter Rudegeair, WSJ. AmEx, with a market cap of $82.1 billion, trades at 15 times forward earnings. Visa trades at 27 times.

2017,"Uber’s Latest Mess, Facebook, Tax Pessimism: DealBook Briefing","Travis Kalanick staged a power play at Uber late last week, and a showdown with the company’s board could come as soon as Tuesday. Here’s what happened. Thursday: Uber and an investor, Goldman Sachs, made a proposal to the board that would reduce Mr. Kalanick’s voting power at the company. • The plan also expands the powers of the chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, and pushes the company toward an initial public offering in the next two years, according to Bloomberg’s Eric Newcomer. Friday: Mr. Kalanick filled two board seats that he controlled, adding Ursula Burns, the former C.E.O. of Xerox, and John Thain, the former C.E.O. of Merrill Lynch. He said that was a response to the proposal. Katie Benner and Mike Isaac, NYT: Mr. Kalanick’s actions were “disappointing,” Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote on Friday in a letter to employees that was obtained by The New York Times. “Anyone would tell you that this is highly unusual.” Still, Uber directors are reluctant to oppose the new board appointments, people briefed on internal discussions told The NYT. The context Uber is trying to finalize a deal with SoftBank of Japan to let existing investors cash out. (Goldman is working on that plan.) What’s next Uber’s board is scheduled to discuss the voting rights proposal on Tuesday. More from Bloomberg: “I hope nobody puts this into a model of good corporate governance,” said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors. “But they’re dealing with a specific problem in any way they can, and the problem is excessive power for the former CEO, who has the potential to undermine the authority of the new CEO. So I am pretty sympathetic to them.” On the radar Bloomberg: Mr. Khosrowshahi will meet on Tuesday with London’s travel regulators, who have declined to renew the company’s license to operate in their city. Congress The company said on Sunday that it planned to turn over more than 3,000 Russian-linked advertisements to congressional investigators on Monday. Mike Isaac and Scott Shane, NYT: Facebook has yet to disclose the types of advertisements and content the company will hand over. But news reports have linked the posts to issues such as religion, race, gun ownership and other politically charged topics. China The company has blocked the profile of Guo Wengui, a Chinese billionaire who lives in exile in New York and has described deep corruption among the families of top Communist Party officials. Alexandra Stevenson, NYT: The social media network said it had blocked a profile under Mr. Guo’s name and taken down another page associated with him. Facebook said the content on both pages had included someone else’s personal identifiable information, which violates its terms of service. A Facebook spokeswoman didn’t identify who had made the complaint about Mr. Guo. The big read New York: “Does even Mark Zuckerberg know what Facebook is? The same company that gives you birthday reminders also helped ensure the integrity of the German elections.” Business leaders and conservative economists assert that a permanent cut in the corporate tax rate is the best way to spur investment and job growth. But the Republican proposal may not give them that reassurance. Alan Rappeport, NYT: The ability to pay for the tax cuts matters because of Senate rules requiring legislation that adds to the federal deficit after a decade to expire. If Republicans can’t show that a long-term tax cut will be deficit-neutral, they will have to scale back the size of the corporate tax cuts, make them temporary or find another way to pay for them. The prominent economic pessimist David Stockman, a director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration, said Wall Street was “delusional” if it believed the plan would pass. What Mr. Stockman told CNBC: “This is a fiscal disaster that when they [Wall Street] begin to look at it, they’ll see it’s not even remotely paid for. This bill will go down for the count.” Meanwhile, the Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin thinks the rise in the price of value stocks is about to end. From his note on Friday, “Fade the value rally”: “Improved prospects of fiscal stimulus and a rebound in interest rates have contributed to a rotation to value from growth ... We expect growth stocks will outperform given our forecast of modest G.D.P. growth and limited upside to oil prices.” Per Michael C. Bender, WSJ: The contenders President Trump has met so far: Jerome Powell, a current Federal Reserve governor; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor Also in the running: The current chairwoman, Janet Yellen; John Taylor, a Stanford economist; John Allison, the former C.E.O. of BB&T Bank More from The WSJ: The search for a new Fed chairman has been largely informal until now. Several White House officials had described the shortlist of candidates as existing only in Mr. Trump’s mind. But the president has started to interview candidates in recent days, one White House official said. Evercore ISI analysts on Friday: “Kevin Warsh would be a great leader.” Their reasoning: • Probably no one in the (credible) policy-making world is more philosophically opposed to the existing regime/leadership. • He’s not a believer in rigid central bank “independence.” • He would work a lot more in concert (or at least have a closer relationship or dialogue) with the fiscal authorities. Evercore ISI’s bottom line: “Think more Greenspan, less Bernanke/Yellen.” But the NYT’s Kate Kelly warned over the weekend not to draw too many conclusions from the interview process. The euro was knocked down on Monday as investors kept an eye on the Catalan independence referendum, which was marked by violence and left hundreds injured. But fallout for the broader markets is expected to be limited for now. Esteban Duarte and Maria Tadeo, Bloomberg: “The developments in Catalonia sent the euro lower in early trading, but is unlikely to cause wider negative effects on European asset prices,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “We could see euro drifting lower especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve acts on their hawkish rhetoric and tax reforms in the U.S. gather momentum.” There could be more uncertainty ahead, especially if the Catalan government unilaterally declares independence. Vanity Fair’s latest list is out. Who’s up, who’s down and who has stayed put: • Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg hold on in first and second place. • Evan Spiegel of Snap drops from third to 28th, following the trajectory of his company’s stock price. • Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia and the 2016 presidential election, makes his debut at number six. • Also in the top 10: Tim Cook, Larry Page and Elon Musk. • Mr. Khosrowshahi comes in at 42, while the Uber whistle-blower Susan Fowler is No. 79. DealBook’s Andrew Ross Sorkin is headed to Los Angeles for the Vanity Fair Summit, where he’ll be interviewing Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, and the filmmaker Ava DuVernay. Investors had written them off as overpriced and underperforming — but now they’re making money and taking in new cash. The average hedge fund is up 5.4 percent through the end of August. Rob Copeland, WSJ: “It just feels better,” said Alper Ince, a partner at the hedge-fund investor Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co. Mr. Ince credited an improved environment for stock picking that has fallen in hedge funds’ favor, with popular stocks like Amazon.com Inc. outperforming, and bets against retailers also paying off. • Marc St John, the partner at CVC who led the takeovers of Formula One and Breitling, will step down in March after two decades at the firm, according to The FT. • Vis Raghavan, JPMorgan Chase’s deputy chief executive and head of banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will take over full leadership of the region from Daniel Pinto, the bank’s chief of investment banking, according to The FT.",The New York Times
2017,Ugandan Rebel Group Massacres 22 in Congo,"NAIROBI, Kenya — Rebels from an Islamist militant group killed 22 people in an ambush in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo on Saturday night, the authorities said. The killings, which came amid fighting that began on Friday night, were carried out by members of the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group with origins in neighboring Uganda that is accused of killing hundreds of people over the past three years. There were 10 survivors, according to Balyesima Kadokima, a member of Parliament. Many victims of the attack, in the Beni region of North Kivu Province, were state officials who were coming from the border city of Nobili to spend the weekend, said Teddy Kataliko, a local activist. The rebels, armed with machetes and guns, ambushed a group of nine motorcycles traveling on the road from Nobili to Beni, said Omar Kavota, a member of North Kivu Civil Society, a nongovernmental organization. The Congolese military said that Ugandan rebels also attacked three army camps north of Beni on Saturday. After several hours of fighting, the military camps fell into the rebels’ hands, the military said. More than 800 people have been killed in violence in the region since October 2014, according to civil society groups and the United Nations peacekeeping force in Congo. More than 180,000 people have been displaced. “This startling wave of attacks transformed Beni territory from an area of relative calm into one of the country’s most violent theaters of conflict in a decade,” said a report by the Congo Research Group at New York University, released on Friday by Human Rights Watch. The attacks “bring unprecedented levels of brutality to the area,” it said. The situation in the area deteriorated after the United Nations peacekeeping force began operations against local and international armed groups, including the Allied Democratic Forces and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. The number of killings has increased since more than 900 inmates — the majority of whom were members of the Allied Democratic Forces — escaped from Kangbayi prison in Beni last June. The rebel group is highly concentrated in the Beni region, where it trains its fighters. The United Nations peacekeeping regularly conducts operations with the Congolese army to neutralize the Ugandan rebels. In August 2016, the Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda made a commitment that the two countries would cooperate in sharing information on the rebel group, but this has so far failed to stifle the violence.",The New York Times
2017,Uhuru Kenyatta Is Declared Winner of Kenya’s Repeat Election,"NAIROBI, Kenya — President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared on Monday the winner of Kenya’s presidential election — for the second time this year. Mr. Kenyatta received nearly 7.5 million votes in the repeated vote, held last week, the national elections commission announced. Mr. Kenyatta also won the first election, in August, by 1.4 million votes. But the opposition leader, Raila Odinga, challenged the results, and the Supreme Court nullified the election in September, citing irregularities. Backers of Mr. Kenyatta interpreted both of his wins as broad national support for the president, but opposition supporters said they had twice been disenfranchised by a process that lacked credibility. Mr. Odinga withdrew from the second election two weeks before the vote, arguing that the electoral commission could not oversee a free and fair process, and he called on his supporters to boycott. His name nevertheless appeared on the ballot, and he collected just over 73,000 votes, compared with nearly seven million in August. Elections officials also cast doubt on the credibility of the process in the days before the vote. One commissioner fled the country and resigned, citing death threats and questioning the impartiality of the commission. The top elections official, Wafula Chebukati, warned a week before the polls opened that political interference in the commission’s work was likely to undermine the credibility and neutrality of the vote. Mr. Chebukati backtracked on that criticism while announcing the results on Monday, declaring the process “free and fair.” At least 14 people have been killed in election-related violence since the Oct. 26 vote, according to international officials, and more have been injured. The rights group Amnesty International said on Monday that it had documented at least four deaths and more than a dozen injuries since the election that it said were committed by the police, most of them in western Kenya. Government figures put the death toll at 10. Rights groups documented nearly 70 deaths that they said occurred at the hands of the police in the days after the August vote. In his victory speech, Mr. Kenyatta boasted of his August victory and recast the Supreme Court’s nullification as an endorsement of his win. “The numbers were never questioned,” Mr. Kenyatta said. “What the court questioned was the process of declaring my victory.” On Saturday, violence broke out in the Kawangware neighborhood of Nairobi, where several people were wounded and a supermarket was burned down. Residents blamed people from Mr. Kenyatta’s ethnic group, the Kikuyu, from which he draws strong support. One Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of protocol, expressed concern that the violence had taken on a more ethnic overtone in the days after the election. Martin Kimani, the director of the Kenyan national counterterrorism center, said that opposition supporters had provoked the violence. On Sunday, he accused Mr. Odinga of “dog-whistle politics” aimed at inciting ethnic violence and obstructing the vote. “This is active sabotage of an election,” he said. “The dog whistle comes from the top, and the middle and lower levels act on it.” Four counties in western Kenya, an opposition stronghold representing 1.6 million votes, were unable to participate in the second election. In some places on Election Day, opposition demonstrators erected roadblocks and intercepted ballot papers. In others, polling stations were blockaded, and protesters clashed with the police. Electoral officials at first delayed balloting in those counties and eventually canceled it completely, saying the outcome in those areas would not affect the overall result. Mr. Odinga told his supporters last week that he would transform his party into a “resistance movement.” In speeches in Kawangware on Sunday, he pinned the violence there on his opponents. “The killing here was very beastly,” he told a crowd gathered at a church. “The killing was well planned and executed,” he said, and was intended as “a direct warning to others.” Mr. Odinga condemned the violence, which he described as perpetrated by Kenyatta supporters, but stopped short of urging his own supporters not to react with violence. Kenyans, foreign diplomats and even some of Mr. Kenyatta’s own supporters have called on the president to engage with opposition leaders after his win, but in his victory speech the president distanced himself from dialogue. “Those who want to ask me, ‘Are you going to engage in dialogue with so and so and so and so?’, let them first and foremost exhaust the constitutionally laid out processes,” Mr. Kenyatta said. “I am not going to jump the gun.”",The New York Times
2017,"Un-erasing Puerto Rico’s Debt, Unbundling Bloomberg: DealBook Briefing","Never mind President Trump’s comments about wiping out Puerto Rico’s $74 billion debt. Here’s what Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said to CNN: “Puerto Rico is going to have to figure out how to fix the errors that it’s made for the last generation on its own finances.” He later told Bloomberg: “We are not going to bail them out … We are not going to pay off those debts. We are not going to bail out those bond holders.” The context Heather Gillers, WSJ: Puerto Rico’s benchmark general obligation bonds maturing in 2035 traded at record lows of 30 cents on the dollar Wednesday, down from roughly 44 cents late Tuesday and 56 cents the day before Hurricane Maria hit. Holders of the bonds, which include mutual funds, hedge funds and direct investors, sold in heavy volume. Howard Cure of Evercore Wealth Management told The WSJ: “I think the market was very anxious about the paper to begin with.” David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors told Politico: “No idea what [Trump] means. It certainly threw a curve at markets.” A reminder Here are Mr. Trump’s comments on Puerto Rico, in an interview with Fox News: A looming deadline Puerto Rico’s Treasury secretary, Raúl Maldonado, said the government could shut down on Oct. 31 if Congress doesn’t provide billions of dollars in emergency funds. (He has requested $6 billion to $8 billion.) The commonwealth’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, told Bloomberg: “Essentially you’re looking at zero revenue for the next couple of months … While you have zero revenue, you still have expenditures, plus emergency expenditures. That means the money is going to run out very quickly.” A Big Creditor Is Unmasked The Intercept’s David Dayen figured out that Seth Klarman’s $30 billion hedge fund, Baupost Group, owns nearly $1 billion worth of the island’s debt. • Baupost owns Cofina bonds, which are backed by some of Puerto Rico’s sales tax revenue. • The hedge fund bought the bonds through a shell company named Decagon Holdings. More from The Intercept: But while GoldenTree and Whitebox were known Cofina bondholders, Baupost had never publicly stated that they owned Puerto Rican debt. When Roll Call asked Sean Neary, a spokesperson for the coalition of Cofina bondholders, about Baupost’s role, he would only say, “They are not part of the steering committee group that is the main driver of the coalition.” Must-read Antonio Weiss, the former Lazard deal maker who worked on Puerto Rico issues while serving in the Obama administration, argues in an NYT op-ed that the island’s debt should be cut as much as possible: President Trump, who visited Puerto Rico on Tuesday, has said in tweets that the island’s debts “sadly must be dealt with.” That is true — but not by enhancing creditors’ returns. Instead, the island’s crushing debt should be reduced to the maximum extent through the legal framework established by Congress last year. The financial information juggernaut plans to roll out a $10-a-month-per-user chat service, available to all customers, by the end of the year, according to The FT. The reason To combat Symphony, the “Bloomberg killer” backed by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and a slew of other financial firms. The tale of the tape • Bloomberg’s standard service bundle, terminal and all, costs $22,000 a year per user for a two-year contract. • Symphony costs $20 a month per user. • Bloomberg has about 33 percent of the financial data market, per The FT. Thomson Reuters has 23 percent. • But Bloomberg’s installed base fell slightly last year, to 324,485 terminals, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting. The context • Symphony was born after reports in 2013 that Bloomberg reporters were using terminal data to gather information on bank employees. • Cost-conscious banks are reconsidering how many employees need pricey Bloomberg terminals. The reaction Morgan Downey, the C.E.O. of a financial data service and a former Bloomberg employee, told The FT: “They’re betting the whole system without chat is worth $21,900 a year. Is it? Maybe for some old bond traders, but for everyone else, I don’t think so.” FT Lex: “The next problem for Bloomberg is to figure out if it can create new products that get users excited about paying full price again.” More in finance-goes-Silicon-Valley Deutsche Bank: The bank will put over 150,000 lines of code from its award-winning electronic platform Autobahn into the public domain so that trading applications from different providers can use it as a shared foundation and work seamlessly with each other. The details, per Serena Saitto, Alfred Lee and Amir Efrati of The Information: • SoftBank will buy existing shares at a valuation of $50 billion, or $35 per share. • Employees can sell up to 50 percent of their holdings. • The first stage of the tender offer will run for 30 days. If SoftBank doesn’t get at least 14 percent of Uber’s outstanding stock, it will raise its offer price. Bonus Think you could make it as an Uber driver? Play this game from The FT and find out.

2017,Uncovering an Overlooked Source for Iconic Alabaster Statues,"Trilobites Medieval and Renaissance sculptors carved gorgeous statues and religious icons from alabaster, a soft, creamy white stone similar to marble. Much of their work, from visages of the Virgin Mary to angels slaying demons, now reside in museums like the Louvre in Paris and others across Europe. But a mystery remains: Where did the alabaster come from? “This is quite a frustration for museum art historians to have question marks everywhere,” said Wolfram Kloppmann, a geochemist at the French Geological Survey. In a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Kloppmann and a team of art historians, geologists and geochemists traced the origins of more than 60 alabaster statue. While many came from known quarries in England and Spain, the analysis of the stone also revealed an overlooked hub for alabaster production in the western French Alps. The site was a much richer source of the mineral than previously thought. The researchers’ work helped reconstruct an art trade route that existed across western Europe from the 12th to 17th centuries. “This gives a picture of Medieval Europe in details we didn’t suspect before,” Dr. Kloppmann said. The team asked museums and galleries across Europe and in the United States if they could take samples from their alabaster artwork for chemical analysis. They all said yes, allowing the team to investigate the origins of several royal and papal tomb figures, as well as the 14th century Carrying of the Cross from the Louvre, the 14th century the Archangel Gabriel from an Annunciation Group from the Cleveland Museum of Art and a 17th century seated greyhound originally from a gallery in London. But the team had to collect samples as carefully as possible to avoid scarring the priceless works of art. They could not drill. They could not scrape. Instead, they used a tiny chisel to collect just a flake that measured only two millimeters from the base or rear of each statue. At their lab, the scientists analyzed the flakes for sulfur, oxygen and strontium isotopes. Such signatures are fingerprints that made it possible to match the flakes to their original alabaster quarries. Of the 66 samples, 15 came from a quarry in the English Midlands to the west of Nottingham and three came from northern Spain. Both were historically well-known as centers for the alabaster trade. The “alabastermen” of the English Midlands are believed to have provided the material from the 12th century until 1550 when religious icons were banned during a period of civil and religious turmoil in Britain known as the English Reformation, when the Church of England broke away from the Roman Catholic Church. Many of the works were destroyed in this period. Shiploads of alabaster artwork escaped the furnaces and were sent to France. This exchange was long thought to be one of the primary sources of the country’s alabaster. But to the team’s surprise more than 20 of the statues they analyzed originated from near Notre-Dame-de-Mésage in the western French Alps. The quarry there operated for more than five centuries, supplying material for some of western Europe’s most important artworks. “We did not know that this was really a major source of alabaster in western Europe,” said Dr. Kloppmann. “We discovered the French part of the story.” Jane A. Evans, an isotope geochemist from the British Geological Survey who was not involved in the study, called the paper “well-constructed” and said the technique “could be extended to look at a wider range of carvings from differing periods, and they could extend their fingerprinting methods to incorporate other isotope and geochemical methods.” Dr. Kloppmann said the next steps for their work is to analyze alabaster in Germany, Poland and Italy and perhaps from ancient Mesopotamia, as well as use their technique to detect alabaster fakes.",The New York Times
2017,"Opinion | Under Mr. Trump, America Surrenders","Editorial Americans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II. But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to “the ash heap of history,” went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America’s commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles. There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America’s guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create. President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been “losing,” a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put “America first” while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America’s reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America’s standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties. The latest assaults occurred last week, when, in the space of a few days, Mr. Trump walked away from or threatened to walk away from an important agreement on Iran, a relationship with Unesco and the North American Free Trade Agreement, painstakingly negotiated in the first Bush and the Clinton administrations. For more than a year Mr. Trump denigrated the Iran deal, under which Iran would substantially halt its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. On Friday he formally disavowed it by refusing to certify that Iran is in compliance. While he stopped short of explicitly killing the accord or rewriting it, the president did it great harm and kicked its fate to Congress, where its future is uncertain. He did so despite the advice of his top people — the secretaries of defense and state and his military and intelligence chiefs — who say the agreement is in America’s interest; and despite the assurance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran 24/7 under a robust verification regime, that Tehran is abiding by its terms. The countries that negotiated the deal with Mr. Obama — Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia — also begged the White House to stick with it. But Mr. Trump demonstrated once again that he can’t abide his predecessor’s accomplishments, that he will not be persuaded by facts and that he places little or no value on the idea that honoring national commitments safeguards confidence in America’s word. Why would North Korea negotiate with the United States over its nuclear stockpile when it sees how little store the Trump administration sets by diplomatic accords? America’s European allies, outraged by Mr. Trump’s decision, have since reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, which includes encouraging European companies to invest in Iran. (Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering a visit to Tehran, which would be a first for a French president since the 1970s.) Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, because of its anti-Israel bias, is not likely to be nearly as consequential as his opposition to the Iran deal, although it extends his war on international obligations. And his threat to tear up Nafta is still just a threat, albeit an ominous one. Most economists agree that Nafta contributed to some job losses in manufacturing but that abandoning it would hurt the economy over all. Even American industries that brought some production back within the borders would probably use fewer workers than in the past, because of automation. Further, other sectors of the economy, like agriculture and services, would stand to lose business if Canada and Mexico imposed higher tariffs on American imports. Whatever gains the United States might enjoy by torpedoing Nafta are unlikely to be enough to justify alienating two of its most important allies and neighbors. If revoked or substantially renegotiated, Nafta would join an already sizable list of agreements on which Mr. Trump has reneged, including the Paris accord on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another trade agreement. He has meanwhile raised doubts in various speeches and offhand remarks about his commitment to the United Nations and to NATO. And to what end? The stock answer is that he is seeking to placate and energize his “base” — the voters troubled by economic decline — by building a wall not just against immigrants but against economic competition and foreign entanglements, thereby making their lives and livelihoods more secure. In an economically interdependent world, that is a false promise. It also undermines critically important global relationships, erodes American credibility and cedes influence and the investment opportunities that go with it to ambitious nations like China that are only too happy to fill the role. America First, Mr. Trump says. America last is more like it.",The New York Times
2017,"Under Mueller Scrutiny, Democratic Donor Tony Podesta Resigns From Lobbying Firm","WASHINGTON — Tony Podesta, a prominent lobbyist and Democratic donor who has come under scrutiny from the escalating special counsel investigation, stepped down on Monday from the firm he co-founded, according to people familiar with the firm. The firm, the Podesta Group, has lost clients as it has been increasingly drawn into the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. On Monday, the Podesta Group and another company with which it had worked, Mercury Public Affairs, were referenced — though not by name — in an indictment of two former Trump campaign officials, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. No charges have been brought against Mr. Podesta or officials from the Podesta Group or Mercury. But both firms have been subpoenaed for records and testimony about their work on behalf of a client referred to them in 2012 by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a nonprofit group based in Brussels. The work for the European Center, which ended in 2014, was cited in the indictment on Monday as part of a “scheme” by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to gain support in Washington for their longtime client, the pro-Russian leader Viktor F. Yanukovych, a former president of Ukraine, while evading disclosure requirements for foreign lobbying. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates were charged with violating tax, banking and foreign lobbying laws in an effort to hide more than $75 million in income from their work in Ukrainian politics. The indictment was the subject of intense interest on K Street, where the Justice Department’s enforcement of the foreign lobbying requirements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act is widely seen as toothless. The charges against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates that are related to the act, coming as powerful members of Congress are demanding more enforcement of the law, were seen by some as a shot across the bow of Washington lobbyists. Mr. Podesta announced his departure at a staff meeting on Monday. He is the brother of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta, who co-founded the firm. Tony Podesta has become the target of attacks from conservatives looking to shift attention away from Mr. Mueller’s scrutiny of President Trump’s campaign team. A person familiar with Mr. Podesta’s remarks at Monday’s staff meeting said he cited attacks from Fox News and the conservative media as making it “impossible to run a public affairs shop.” That person was not authorized to publicly discuss the internal meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. A partner at the firm, who also did not want to be identified discussing delicate internal affairs, said that even before Mr. Podesta announced his departure, some senior partners were trying to convince clients to remain with them as they worked to reintroduce the company with branding that would not include Mr. Podesta’s name. The partner added that the effort had been fueled partly by Mr. Podesta’s aggressive efforts to defend himself against coverage by the conservative news media on the special counsel’s scrutiny of the Podesta Group. The firm has been among Washington’s highest grossing lobbying shops for years. Mr. Podesta’s resignation was first reported by Politico on Monday afternoon. Mr. Podesta’s lawyer on Monday sent a cease-and-desist letter to a Fox News host over his claims on air that Mr. Podesta and his brother, John Podesta, worked closely with Mr. Manafort on behalf of Russia. The host, Tucker Carlson, said that the Podesta brothers and Mr. Manafort were the “central figures” in Mr. Mueller’s investigation. A lawyer representing Tony Podesta, a powerful Democratic lobbyist, sent a letter to Tucker Carlson, a host at Fox News, demanding a retraction of claims by Mr. Carlson about Mr. Podesta's foreign lobbying. Mr. Podesta’s lawyer, Geoffrey R. Garinther, wrote to Mr. Carlson on Monday that his “false and defamatory statements have caused damage and injury to the reputation of Mr. Podesta and the Podesta Group.” The indictment on Monday did not name the Podesta Group or Mercury, instead referring to them as “two Washington, D.C., firms” that were recruited by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates “to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych, the Party of Regions, and the government of Ukraine.” Mr. Podesta and a spokesman for his firm did not respond to requests for comment. Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury, said in a statement that the firm “takes its obligations to follow all laws, rules and regulations very seriously” and “has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the Special Counsel in its investigation.” The companies were paid more than $1.1 million each, according to lobbying filings, to try to rally support among American policymakers and opinion leaders for Mr. Yanukovych, and to quell concerns about his leadership and his government’s jailing of a political rival. Neither firm initially registered with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires firms that lobby or conduct public relations for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work. The Podesta Group and Mercury said they relied on assurances provided by the nonprofit group that it was neither funded nor controlled by any foreign government or party. But both firms were compelled this year to belatedly — and, in the case of Mercury, begrudgingly — register under the act, after their activities came under scrutiny from the Justice Department. In his statement, Mr. McKeon said Mercury followed the advice of legal counsel in its disclosure of its relationship with the European Center and noted that it registered the relationship under less detailed congressional lobbying disclosure rules. The Podesta Group also reported its relationship with the European Center under those disclosure rules.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Undermining the Rule of Law at the E.P.A.,"Op-Ed Contributor In the more than seven months since he became administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt has been on a reckless mission to dismantle public health safeguards and environmental protections. Mr. Pruitt’s E.P.A. wants to postpone or roll back dozens of rules that save lives and provide clean air and water, including efforts by the Obama administration to combat climate change and to protect rivers and streams from pollution. Last week brought more bad news: Mr. Pruitt is proposing to end a decades-long agreement with the Justice Department that funds the E.P.A.’s lawsuits against polluters responsible for creating hazardous waste sites. Neither Congress nor the courts will have the final say. The decision rests with the Trump administration. Since the Reagan administration, the E.P.A. has reimbursed the Justice Department for the cost of suing companies as part of the Superfund hazardous waste site cleanup program. In communities like the Love Canal neighborhood in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Times Beach, Mo., the Justice Department sued polluters to force them to pay the cost of relocating residents. More recently, the E.P.A. covered the upfront costs of suing the W. R. Grace chemical conglomerate in the small town of Libby, Mont., where hundreds have died from asbestos poisoning, and compelling General Electric to clean up decades of PCB pollution that ravaged the Hudson River. But in its budget proposal, the E.P.A. said it no longer intended to reimburse the Justice Department for Superfund litigation costs. These lawsuits are expensive, with Justice Department lawyers doing battle, often for years, with the largest law firms in America. But the return on the agency’s investment is substantial. The Justice Department recovers hundreds of millions of dollars every year in cleanup costs to replenish the Superfund program’s coffers, which enables the E.P.A. to conduct more hazardous waste cleanups, including emergency responses to chemical releases like those that occurred after Hurricane Harvey. For the Environment and Natural Resources Division at the Justice Department, which represents the E.P.A. and other federal agencies in court, funding from the E.P.A. is essential. In its budget proposal for 2018, the Justice Department indicated that it expected to receive approximately $25 million from the E.P.A., enough to pay for 69 lawyers as well as support staff, nearly 20 percent of the division. If the E.P.A. stopped paying for Superfund work, significant layoffs would be likely at the Justice Department. But that would be just the beginning. More than half of the Environment Division’s work is defensive, meaning it represents the E.P.A. and other agencies in lawsuits brought by regulated industries, environmental groups and state attorneys general. That work is considered nondiscretionary — the Justice Department must represent the government when federal agencies like the E.P.A. are defendants — so the spending cuts and layoffs would have to come from elsewhere in the Environment Division. As a result, there could be cuts exceeding 40 percent from the Environment Division offices that prosecute environmental crimes like the Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal, seek civil penalties and natural resource damages in cases like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and sue polluters that are responsible for Superfund hazardous waste sites. Mr. Pruitt’s proposal is a breathtakingly bad idea, giving polluters license to do their dirty work with less fear of punishment and a greater ability to outlast an understaffed Justice Department in court. The victims would be ordinary Americans, many of them poor and minorities, who often live closest to where environmental violations occur and where the worst Superfund sites are located. Yet blocking Mr. Pruitt will depend on opposition from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and intervention by the White House, which so far has shown no inclination to curtail the E.P.A. administrator’s anti-environmental zeal. For decades, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have prosecuted environmental crimes and sued polluters to recover the cost of cleaning up their messes. Vigorous enforcement of the environmental laws has been nonpartisan, because it protects our communities from harmful pollution and ensures that polluters don’t get a free ride at the expense of taxpayers. Prosecuting polluters also makes sense for American businesses, most of which are committed to meeting their legal obligations and conducting their affairs in a responsible, ethical manner. Why should good companies that invest in environmental compliance be at a competitive disadvantage against the lawbreakers that would be harder to bring to justice under Mr. Pruitt’s cynical ploy? Mr. Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general, claims state governments can fill the void created by a diminished E.P.A. His argument ignores the fact that most states lack the resources to take on big polluters. Before the E.P.A. was created in 1970, the United States saw what happens when the federal government does not protect our communities from pollution: the Cuyahoga River on fire in Cleveland, a devastating oil spill sullying the beaches in Santa Barbara, Calif., and thousands of drums of hazardous waste, many leaking toxic chemicals, at the Valley of the Drums in Kentucky. The system of environmental laws in the United States resulted from bipartisan consensus about the need to protect public health and the environment from harmful pollution. Previous E.P.A. administrators, in Republican and Democratic administrations, have supported strong enforcement of those laws, recognizing that laws are only as good as their enforcement. By weakening E.P.A.’s commitment to bringing polluters to justice, Mr. Pruitt abandons communities scarred by pollution and undermines the rule of law.",The New York Times
2017,"Understanding Ethereum, Bitcoin’s Virtual Cousin","Bitcoin has many cousins and competitors. None have grown more popular than Ethereum, a global computer network with its own virtual currency, called Ether. Ethereum is a global computing network operating according to rules defined by Ethereum software. Those rules allow the Ethereum network to be programmed to complete certain types of computing tasks, with every computer on the network completing the task in parallel to ensure it is done correctly. Generally the tasks involve money. The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has likened it to a global smartphone that can be programmed to operate according to the apps built on top of it. The apps are called Dapps because they are run by a decentralized network of computers. Mr. Buterin says he chose the name because it refers to “the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.” He announced Ethereum in late 2013, but it didn’t go into operation until 2015. The Ethereum network has its own virtual currency, Ether. In the simplest sense, Ether are needed to pay the other computers on the network to complete tasks. It isn’t free to use the network. People have also decided to buy and hold Ether, betting that it will become more valuable as more people want to use the network and need Ether to pay for the network’s computing power. Mr. Buterin was a Bitcoin aficionado, and he was inspired by its success. But he set out to build something that could do more than Bitcoin: He wanted to build a system that would make it possible to program more complex financial transactions. The shared records of the Ethereum network — of every transaction and computation it has ever performed — are known as a blockchain, just as the shared records of all Bitcoin transactions are known as a blockchain. But Ethereum’s blockchain database is totally independent of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Let’s say two companies want to conduct a complicated financial transaction, like settling a stock option. Neither company trusts the other company to conduct the transaction on its computers. Both companies could hire a third party, like a stock exchange, to conduct the transaction, which is what they generally do today. But that forces them to trust that third company and to pay that company fees. With Ethereum, they can conduct the transaction on a shared computer that allows them both to check the records, ideally saving on fees. As this example suggests, Ethereum has proved attractive to financial companies that have to complete lots of complicated financial transactions with competitors they don’t trust. Many banks are looking at how Ethereum could be used as a central operating system for various trading markets, replacing today’s exchanges and middlemen. JPMorgan Chase has even created its own version of Ethereum, known as Quorum. Other companies, like Samsung and Toyota, have experimented with Ethereum as a way to keep track of products moving through supply chains that involve many players. Dozens of large companies around the world came together this year to create the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The group is working to develop versions of the Ethereum software that are battle tested enough to be used in a corporate setting. The versions of the Ethereum software that companies are building will most likely be used to set up private networks that would be totally separate from the public Ethereum network and that would not use the Ether currency. Some people, though, are betting that these private networks will eventually be plugged back into the public network. Just as with Bitcoin, you can buy Ether from people who already own them on virtual currency exchanges. Most large countries have exchanges where a variety of virtual currencies can be bought with the local currency. Just as with Bitcoin, Ethereum are “mined,” or created by computers joined into the Ethereum network. These computers are in a race to complete the transactions and computing work on the network. The faster your computers, the more likely you are to win the race and receive a bundle of new Ether. There is generally a new winner every 15 seconds or so. It has not yet been decided how many Ether will ultimately be distributed, but the number is likely to be around 100 million. So far, 94 million have been distributed. As with Bitcoin, Ethereum mining serves a dual process of getting new Ether into the world while providing an incentive for people to join the network and help maintain the Ethereum blockchain.",The New York Times
2017,Underwear Bomber Sues Over Treatment in Supermax Prison,"WASHINGTON — The Nigerian man serving multiple life sentences for trying to blow up an airliner with a bomb hidden in his underwear has sued the Justice Department, arguing that prison officials are violating his rights by holding him in solitary confinement, restricting his communication with relatives and force-feeding him when he goes on a hunger strike to protest. The prisoner, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, is a particularly high-profile terrorist who was prosecuted in civilian court. He tried to blow up a Detroit-bound airplane on Christmas Day 2009 as part of a plot by Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen. The device burned his groin but failed to explode, saving the lives of the other 289 people aboard. After pleading guilty in 2012, Mr. Abdulmutallab was sent to the federal “supermax” prison in Florence, Colorado, and an appeals court in 2014 upheld his conviction and sentence. Little has been heard from him since then. But a lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Colorado opened a window on what his life has been like. Its description resonates with many of the issues raised by the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The force-feeding of detainees on hunger strikes there has been the subject of recurring dispute. And ever since Mr. Abdulmutallab’s attack, when political fallout scuttled the Obama administration’s plan to bring five detainees to New York to be tried in the Sept. 11 attacks, many Republicans have argued that the civilian criminal justice system should not be used to handle foreign terrorism suspects. Mr. Abdulmutallab’s lawsuit does not portray the civilian criminal justice system as coddling him. It said the Justice Department subjected him to “special administrative measures,” severely limiting his ability to communicate with people in the outside world for national-security reasons, and placed him in the penitentiary’s “H-Unit,” where prisoners subjected to such restrictions live alone in single cells. His complaint about life in Florence invokes what he portrays as constitutional violations, as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law that requires the government to accommodate religious practices. Although he is an observant Muslim, the complaint said, he has not been given halal food prepared according to Islamic law, nor has he been permitted to pray collectively with other Muslims or given access to an imam. During prayer time, it also said, guards permit “white supremacist” inmates in the special security unit to ""curse, yell, scream, and say things that are religiously insulting and offensive to Muslims,” and guards sometimes displayed pornography to him while he was trying to pray and, while searching his cell, “defiled” his prayer rug and Quran, ripping its pages and leaving a sticky liquid on it. The press office of the Bureau of Prisons had no immediate response to a request for comment. But Gail Johnson, an attorney for Mr. Abdulmutallab, said in a statement that his rights were being violated. “Prisoners retain fundamental constitutional rights to communicate with others and have family relationships free from undue interference by the government,” she said. “The restrictions imposed on our client are excessive and unnecessary, and therefore we seek the intervention of the federal court.” In protest of the treatment he alleges, along with restrictions on communicating with relatives like his sister and nieces and nephews, Mr. Abdulmutallab began a hunger strike, the complaint said. In response, prison officials transferred him to an even more restrictive part of the prison known as Range 13, where human contact, even with guards, is rare. The complaint cited a recent Justice Department inspector general report in which a Florence prison psychologist said Range 13 was “a form of torture on some level” and qualified as solitary confinement. On several occasions, Mr. Abdulmutallab has engaged in a hunger strike to protest, the complaint said, but ceased after being force-fed. As at Guantánamo, the procedure involves being strapped into a restraint chair and having liquid nutritional supplement poured into his stomach through a nasogastric tube inserted through his nose. The complaint accuses prison officials of using force-feeding before Mr. Abdulmutallab’s life was in danger, and said they are administering it in an unnecessarily painful way by pouring a large volume in very quickly. On one occasion, it said, they inserted the tube into his windpipe rather than his esophagus and poured the supplement into his lungs, making him feel like he was being drowned.",The New York Times
2017,Underweight Women at Risk of Early Menopause,"Underweight women are at increased risk for early menopause, a new study has found. This study, in Human Reproduction, followed 78,759 premenopausal women ages 25 to 42 beginning in 1989. Over the following 22 years, 2,804 of them reported natural menopause before age 45. After controlling for smoking, pregnancies, oral contraceptive use and other factors, they found that compared with women who had a body mass index of 18.5 to 22.4 (within the normal range), those with a B.M.I. under 18.5 at any age had a 30 percent increased risk of early menopause. Overweight women (B.M.I. 25 to 34.9) had a slightly lower risk of early menopause, and there was no significant increased risk in very obese women with a B.M.I. higher than 35. The lead author, Kathleen L. Szegda, who was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, when the work was done, said the reasons for the link between weight and the timing of menopause are unclear and that more research is needed to replicate these results. Still, she said, “Underweight women may want to discuss the findings with their doctors. Early menopause is associated with several health conditions,” including osteoporosis, dementia, heart disease and early death, “and has implications for family planning.”",The New York Times
2017,"Undocumented 17-Year-Old Must Delay Abortion, Court Rules","An undocumented 17-year-old caught in a legal standoff with the federal government must further delay plans for an abortion after an appeals court ruled on Friday that the Department of Health and Human Services had 11 days to find a sponsor to take custody of the teenager. The decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit could put her health at risk, doctors say, especially now that she is about 15 weeks pregnant. “While first-trimester abortion is over 10 times safer than childbirth, the risks gradually increase in the second trimester to those of childbirth,” Dr. Nancy L. Stanwood, the chief of family planning at the Yale School of Medicine, said in an email. Forcing her to wait, she added, “harms her physical health, period.” Further complicating matters, the teenager only has about a month to get an abortion in Texas, where she is being held. The state has banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy unless there is a medical emergency. The teenager, referred to as Jane Doe in court documents, found out she was pregnant last month after she was apprehended while entering the United States without her parents. She decided to end her pregnancy, but Texas law requires a minor to get parental consent or a judicial waiver to do so. She obtained a waiver, but the government prevented her from going to any abortion-related appointments, the American Civil Liberties Union said in court documents, and forced her to visit a religiously affiliated crisis pregnancy center where she was asked to view a sonogram. An undocumented 17-year-old being held by the federal government is seeking an abortion. President Trump has worked to restrict abortions since his first days in office by expanding the so-called global gag rule, which withholds American funding from international organizations that discuss or perform abortions; taking aim at Planned Parenthood funding; and appointing several leaders who are anti-abortion, including E. Scott Lloyd, the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the health department, and one of the defendants in the Jane Doe case. The federal government said that it was not its role to facilitate abortion, and that the teenager still had the option of returning to her home country. “Ms. Doe has options for leaving federal custody — either by requesting a voluntary departure to her home country (which the federal government is willing to expedite if requested) or by being placed in the custody of a sponsor,” the defendants stated in a memorandum on Tuesday. “Given these options, the government is not causing Ms. Doe to carry a pregnancy to term against her will.” On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered the government to allow the teenager to get an abortion. Tanya S. Chutkan, the United States District Court judge who initiated the temporary restraining order, said she was “astounded” by the government’s position. “She can leave the country or she cannot get her abortion, those are her options?” The government next argued for the right to appoint the teenager with a sponsor, which would release her from government custody, and said in court documents that the process of securing a sponsor would not unduly burden the teenager’s right to an abortion. On Friday, the appeals court agreed. The health department has until Oct. 31 to find a suitable sponsor; if it does, Jane Doe would be able to have an abortion. If she is not released to a sponsor by then, the government has the option of appealing once more. The 11-day timeline to find a sponsor “seems far-fetched,” said Brigitte Amiri, one of the A.C.L.U. lawyers representing the teenager. Sponsors are typically family members, according to the health department’s website, who help care for a child who has entered the United States illegally without their parents — often because the child is fleeing an abusive or violent situation. The vetting process, which includes a background check, can take months, Ms. Amiri said, and earlier attempts to find a sponsor for Jane Doe were unsuccessful. “They kicked the can down the road, and in this case they kicked the woman down the road,” Dr. Stanwood said. “They are just delaying her care to no end but their own ideology.” A spokesman for the Administration of Children and Families, which is part of the health department, said in a statement that the care of minors like Jane Doe was important. “For however much time we are given, the Office of Refugee Resettlement and H.H.S. will protect the well-being of this minor and all children and their babies in our facilities, and we will defend human dignity for all in our care,” the statement said. The teenager will be 16 weeks and five days pregnant at the end of October, according to the nonprofit legal organization Jane’s Due Process, which has been working with the A.C.L.U. If the appeals process continues into November, the teenager will reach the 20-week mark, which would prevent her from having an elective abortion in Texas. The sooner the teenager can have the abortion, “the safer it will be for her,” said Dr. Hal C. Lawrence, the executive vice president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who practiced obstetrics for nearly three decades. As the uterus gets bigger, he added, the walls of the uterus get thinner, which increases the possibility of perforation and puts women at risk of additional blood loss during an abortion. Health risks aside, delaying an abortion can cause emotional trauma. “Women don’t just wake up one morning and decide they’re going to have an abortion,” Dr. Lawrence said. “And so to make her continue to struggle and be denied access to something which is legal — all that does is increase the psychological stress for her, and that’s not healthy.” The United States has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the developed world, and abortion has been shown to be safer for women than childbirth. The A.C.L.U. is considering several options, including further appeals. For the teenager, the process has been exhausting, Ms. Amiri said. “She talks about feeling very tired.”",The New York Times
2017,Undocumented Teenager Obtains Abortion After Court Victory,"HOUSTON — A pregnant undocumented teenager in federal custody whose attempt to have an abortion set off a monthlong legal battle with the Trump administration terminated her pregnancy on Wednesday morning. She underwent the procedure a day after a court ruling forced federal officials to allow it. The teenager, who is 17 and is identified in court documents as Jane Doe, illegally crossed the border in Texas in early September and was apprehended. Her pregnancy was discovered during a physical exam, and since then she had been fighting in court to have an abortion. In a statement released by her lawyers and her court-appointed guardian, Jane Doe, who had been nearly 16 weeks pregnant, wrote of coming to the United States with dreams of one day becoming a nurse, and of not being ready to be a parent. “My lawyers have told me that people around the country have been calling and writing to show support for me,” Jane Doe wrote in her statement. “I am touched by this show of love from people I may never know and from a country I am just beginning to know — to all of you, thank you. This is my life, my decision. I want a better future. I want justice.” Jane Doe was transported from the federally funded shelter in Brownsville where she has been living to an abortion provider, which was not identified. She returned to the shelter after the procedure and remains in federal custody. She had received a state court order on Sept. 25 allowing her to have an abortion without her parents’ consent. But the decision that cleared the way came one month later, on Tuesday, when a federal appeals court in Washington sided with Jane Doe, sending the case back to a lower court, which immediately ordered the Trump administration to allow her to obtain an abortion “promptly and without delay.” The Justice Department did not immediately comment on her abortion. But Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, who had led a group of Republican attorneys general in a brief supporting the government’s position, said in a statement, “Today’s loss of innocent human life is tragic.” Jane Doe’s abortion does not end the broader legal fight over the issue. She had crossed the border without a parent or relative, one of the thousands of unaccompanied minors who try to make it to the United States every year. Her lawyers say the federal officials responsible for caring for unaccompanied and undocumented minors cut off Jane Doe’s access to an abortion and pushed an anti-abortion ideology on her, requiring her to undergo counseling at a religiously affiliated center where she was urged to continue her pregnancy. In her statement, Jane Doe said one of the doctors she was forced to see tried to convince her not to have an abortion. Her lawyers have accused officials in the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement of trying to block, delay and insert itself into the abortion decisions of other pregnant undocumented teenagers in their custody. In March, a girl detained in Texas who had taken the first of two doses of pills that would end her pregnancy was forced by the agency, before taking the second dose, to go to an emergency room to see if the pregnancy could be saved, according to court documents. The girl was then allowed to take the second dose and complete the abortion. The agency’s director, Scott Lloyd, has personally visited with pregnant unaccompanied minors, and a new Trump administration policy prohibits shelters from taking any steps to help a minor get an abortion without Mr. Lloyd’s direction and approval, according to court filings. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court to try to stop the Trump administration from interfering with unaccompanied minors’ access to abortion. Jane Doe is the lead plaintiff in that ongoing case. In addition, a government watchdog group, Campaign for Accountability, has asked the inspector general with the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the refugee resettlement agency, to investigate whether Mr. Lloyd had broken federal law in his dealings with pregnant unaccompanied minors. “With this case we have seen the astounding lengths this administration will go to block women from abortion care,” said Brigitte Amiri, the lead lawyer in the Jane Doe case for the A.C.L.U. The Trump administration did not challenge Jane Doe’s right to an abortion. But it had argued in court filings that the federal government is not bound to facilitate access to abortions and that the government “may legitimately express a preference for childbirth over abortion.” The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion regulations are valid as long as those restrictions do not impose an “undue burden” on women seeking abortion, and lawyers for the Justice Department argued that their actions did not unlawfully burden Jane Doe. “There is no precedent, Supreme Court or otherwise, that addresses the issue of whether, if the federal government refuses to facilitate a pregnant unaccompanied minor’s access to abortion while she is in federal custody by virtue of her illegal entry into the United States, that constitutes an ‘undue burden’ on any right to abortion,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in one court filing. Unaccompanied minors are handled differently from adults apprehended at the border. The minors are kept at shelters and detention centers operated by various contractors under the supervision of the resettlement agency. They can voluntarily go back to their home country, or federal authorities can identify an adult sponsor in the United States to whom they can be released while the government decides whether they can permanently remain in the country. Justice Department lawyers had argued that by choosing not to return to her home country and voluntarily remaining in custody, “any alleged ‘obstacle’ to Ms. Doe’s ability to obtain an abortion is by her own choice,” they wrote in court documents. Jane Doe does not wish to return to her home country in Central America, a key element of the case. The country was not identified, but court documents said that abortion is illegal there, and that she said she feared retaliation from her parents. She said they physically abused an older sister when they learned the sibling had become pregnant. In the 6-3 decision on Tuesday that allowed Jane Doe to obtain the abortion, Judge Patricia Millett of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit wrote that the government’s argument that the teenager could end her predicament by simply leaving the country was “not a constitutionally adequate choice” given the danger that could await her at home and the possibility that she could ultimately win the right to remain in the United States. Joe Pojman, the executive director of Texas Alliance for Life, an anti-abortion group, called Jane Doe’s abortion “a sad day for life in Texas.” “What happened to Doe is upsetting to Texas Alliance for Life, and a vast majority of Texans, because alternatives to abortion are readily available in Texas,” he said in a statement. But in her own statement after the procedure on Wednesday, Jane Doe wrote that when she first learned she was pregnant, “I knew immediately what was best for me then, as I do now — that I’m not ready to be a parent.” “People I don’t even know are trying to make me change my mind,” she continued. “I made my decision and that is between me and God. Through all of this, I have never changed my mind.”",The New York Times

2017,Opinion | Unesco Shmunesco,"Shmuel Rosner Last Thursday, the United States announced its intention to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations educational and cultural agency. The American government explained its decision to withdraw from the organization as a response to its “anti-Israel bias.” The United States, a spokeswoman said, does not want to pay the hundreds of millions of dollars that it owes to Unesco until the organization’s anti-Israel bias comes to an end. This should have been music to Israel’s ears, right? Not necessarily, even though Israel promptly announced that it would pull out of Unesco on the United States’ heels. There’s no doubt that the Trump administration is right about Unesco’s unhealthy attitude toward the Jewish state. The organization’s shameful record makes clear that it is obsessed with Israel: Unesco has passed resolutions with the sole aim of rejecting the historic connection between Jews and the Holy Land, including denying Jewish ties to the Temple Mount. In July, it declared the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, an important holy site for Jews, as a Palestinian World Heritage site “in danger” — presumably from Israel. Israel has, appropriately and almost unanimously, been incensed: It called Unesco “shameful and anti-Semitic” and described its decisions as “bizarre and irrelevant.” In July, the Israeli government decided to cut $1 million from its payments to the United Nations in retaliation. Several United Nations agencies have similar anti-Israel tendencies. In fact, the entire United Nations is biased against Israel. It tends to pass one-sided resolutions when Israel is engaged in a conflict; it pays constant attention to Israel and its supposed misbehavior, while other countries, guilty of much worse, barely get mentioned for censure. This is hardly a secret. In March, the deputy assistant secretary of state said that the United States is “deeply troubled” by the United Nations Human Rights Council’s “consistent unfair and unbalanced focus on one democratic country, Israel.” Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, has vowed “to stand up to the U.N.’s anti-Israel bias.” Even Ban Ki-moon, the organization’s previous secretary general, acknowledged the bias against Israel in his final speech before the Security Council: “Decades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports and conferences criticizing Israel,” he said. None of this is new. The United Nations’ hypocrisy and bias has been a constant irritation since Israel was founded. It was David Ben Gurion, the country’s founding prime minister, who coined a derisive phrase, “Um Shmum,” that remains popular in Israel today. (“Um” is the Hebrew pronunciation of the United Nation’s initials; the “sh” prefix is a way of signaling dismissal.) Attitudes haven’t changed much since then: In 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued that “the jury is still out on the United Nations” and that “recent signs are not encouraging.” And yet despite all this, Israel still chooses to be a part of the United Nations. Even amid Unesco’s repeated, ridiculous resolutions, the Israeli government resisted the temptation to withdraw from the organization. Israeli policy toward Unesco was — like its policy toward the rest of the United Nations — pretty simple: Remain a member and fight as hard as you can. Be a player. Do not give Israel’s foes what they want, which is Israel cast aside and ostracized by the international community. Sometimes (though admittedly not often), Israeli even has the chance to achieve something at the United Nations. For example, just before the Trump administration announced its plan to withdraw, Unesco delayed a vote on an anti-Israel resolution. It might not sound like much, but Israel’s envoy to Unesco described it as an “achievement” that was “the result of three years of exhausting, frustrating and difficult diplomatic work.” Enter President Trump. An Israeli strategy 70 years in the making is suddenly severely undermined. (According to news reports, the American decision was made without consulting the Israeli government.) Mr. Netanyahu then announced that when the United States quits Unesco, Israel will follow suit. It has no alternative. Israel can’t possibly let the United States leave an organization over anti-Israel bias and still remain a member itself. At the same time, Israel also can’t appear ungrateful toward the United States and hint that leaving Unesco might not be the best move for Israel. But the truth is, Israel would prefer to continue its longtime strategy at the United Nations: staying a member and fighting for Israel’s interests. Israel would rather work on getting Unesco to improve — become a little less hostile, and even more so, less obsessed with Israel. But now that option seems to be in danger. It’s possible that the election of the former French culture minister, a Jewish woman who has relatives in Israel, to lead Unesco might be a signal that the agency will improve. Or, perhaps, a recognition on the part of other Unesco members that the Trump administration won’t tolerate their anti-Israel shenanigans will sober up the organization. But this can work only if Mr. Trump’s motivation for quitting Unesco is truly to curb its anti-Israel bias. If, on the other hand, his main motivation is to free the United States from paying for something he does not value, then he hasn’t helped Israel. He has hurt it by forcing it out against its will.",The New York Times
2017,Unintended Consequences of Sexual Harassment Scandals,"Extra Caution In Silicon Valley, some male investors have declined one-on-one meetings with women, or rescheduled them from restaurants to conference rooms. On Wall Street, certain senior men have tried to avoid closed-door meetings with junior women. And in TV news, some male executives have scrupulously minded their words in conversations with female talent. In interviews, the men describe a heightened caution because of recent sexual harassment cases, and they worry that one accusation, or misunderstood comment, could end their careers. But their actions affect women’s careers, too — potentially depriving them of the kind of relationships that lead to promotions or investments. It’s an unintended consequence of a season of sex scandals. Research shows that building genuine relationships with senior people is perhaps the most important contributor to career advancement. In some offices it’s known as having a rabbi; researchers call it sponsorship. Unlike mentors, who give advice and are often formally assigned, sponsors know and respect people enough that they are willing to find opportunities for them, and advocate and fight for them. But women are less likely to build such relationships, in part because both senior men and junior women worry that a relationship will be misread by others. At every level, more men than women say they interact with senior leaders at least once a week, according to research by McKinsey and the nonprofit Lean In. This imbalance is a major reason women stall at lower levels of companies, according to a variety of research. “We found that they avoided one-on-one contact because they were fearful of gossip, or the suspicion that a standout female on a team is sleeping with the team leader,” said Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder and chief executive of the Center for Talent Innovation, a research firm that has studied sponsorship. She noted that sponsors “have to spend some capital and take a risk on the up-and-coming person, and you simply don’t do that unless you know them and trust them.” But these relationships are crucial, she said, for “getting from the middle to the top.” Certain workplaces have become more tense in recent months, after high-profile sexual harassment cases at Fox News, in venture capital and elsewhere, and after the vulgar comments about women by Donald J. Trump that emerged during the presidential campaign. Most recently, accusations against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein caused him to be fired. The Society for Human Resource Management, an industry group, said it saw a spike in questions from members about sexual harassment in March — when cases at Uber, Fox News and military academies were in the news — and in August, when harassment surfaced again at Fox, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. In some cases, the heightened awareness has improved people’s behavior. “People are more sensitive to how they conduct themselves, because they’ve seen what can happen,” said a male executive in the news and entertainment industry, who spoke anonymously because of the same heightened caution over the topic that is in the air in some workplaces. “That’s presented a better working environment.” But elsewhere, men have begun avoiding solo interactions with women altogether. In Austin, Tex., a city official was formally reprimanded last month for refusing to meet with female employees, after he ended regular mentoring lunches with one. Some tech investors have taken similar steps. “A big chill came across Silicon Valley in the wake of all these stories, and people are hyperaware and scared of behaving wrongly, so I think they’re drawing all kinds of parameters,” said a venture capitalist who spoke anonymously for the same reason. Some are avoiding solo meetings with female entrepreneurs, potential recruits and those who ask for an informational or networking meeting. “Before, you might have said, ‘Of course I would do that, and I will especially do it for minorities, including women in Silicon Valley,’ ” the investor said. “Now you cancel it because you have huge reputational risk all of a sudden.” Sometimes women avoid solo meetings with men who have made them uncomfortable or have bad reputations, as when female executives brought colleagues to meetings with Mr. Weinstein. It has not happened in every workplace, of course, and depends in part on company culture and employees’ trust in human resources to appropriately deal with harassment. In interviews with people across industries, many said interacting with members of the opposite sex was a nonissue. People were warier in jobs that emphasized appearance, as with certain restaurants or TV networks; in male-dominated industries like finance; and in jobs that involve stark power imbalances, like doctors or investors. Dr. Mukund Komanduri, 50, an orthopedic surgeon with a practice outside Chicago, said he avoids being alone with female colleagues, particularly those he does not know well or who are subordinates. “I’m very cautious about it because my livelihood is on the line,” he said. “If someone in your hospital says you had inappropriate contact with this woman, you get suspended for an investigation, and your life is over. Does that ever leave you?” He mentioned a hospital colleague who lost his job because of harassment allegations. “That individual has created a hypersensitive atmosphere for every other physician,” he said. “We basically stand 10 feet away from everyone we know.” Even before the recent attention on harassment, the practice of avoiding solo meetings with colleagues of the opposite sex was not uncommon. It could mean not sharing in cabs, travel, lunches, projects or get-togethers over coffee, and not meeting behind closed doors. Nearly two-thirds of men and women say people should take extra caution around members of the opposite sex at work, and about a quarter think private work meetings with colleagues of the opposite sex are inappropriate, according to a poll conducted in May by Morning Consult for The New York Times. The effect on women’s careers is quantifiable, research has found. Women with sponsors are more likely to get challenging assignments and raises and to say they are satisfied with their career progress, according to data from the Center for Talent Innovation. Yet 64 percent of senior men and 50 percent of junior women avoid solo interactions because of the risk of rumors about their motives, according to a survey by the center. Good sponsors also give candid, difficult feedback, and women are less likely than men to receive it, McKinsey and Lean In found. Megan Ketchum, 37, recently got a promotion to sales leader at LinkedIn. It’s a job that required new skills, and she said she got it largely based on the trust and friendship she’d built with leaders on her team, who were all men. One of them regularly invited her to go for walks and grab coffee. “Trust does get built through intimacy and understanding others and sharing values,” she said. “That comes from interactions that are one-on-one, and not super formal in a conference room with an agenda.” The dynamic affects racial and other minorities in the workplace, too. “Sponsorship is so often a mini-me — straight white guys sponsoring younger straight white guys,” Ms. Hewlett said. By getting to know people who are different from them, leaders can avoid playing favorites — which can happen if sponsorship isn’t done well and which can hurt office morale. One way to encourage these relationships is to have more people at the top of companies who are not straight white men. In interviews, women in companies with many female or gay executives were more likely to say one-on-one relationships had never been an issue for them. Another way is for companies to explicitly support relationship-building meetings. Some companies, for instance, have designated a certain restaurant where senior leaders take protégées for breakfast or lunch. “Once you see it happening out in public, then it becomes the norm,” said Laura Sherbin, director of research at the Center for Talent Innovation. She added, “If you don’t want people to judge you when you go out with a senior leader, don’t be someone who judges another person.” It helps when leaders talk about their families, introduce junior employees to their spouses or invite them to their homes, researchers said. And would-be sponsors and would-be sponsorees can build relationships in daily moments in the office, said Lareina Yee, a senior partner at McKinsey who studied the issue with Lean In. “It’s walking down the hallway, it’s seeking the opinion of others, it’s catching someone after a meeting,” she said. “It may be an unintentional blind spot, but it’s something you could start changing on a Monday morning.”",The New York Times
2017,Unions Sue to Block ‘Watered Down’ Rules for Charter Teacher Training,"A fight over charter schools and teacher training escalated on Thursday when the city and state teachers’ unions filed a lawsuit in state court seeking to prevent new rules from going into effect that allow some charters to certify their own teachers. In a suit filed with the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the two unions, along with two charter schoolteachers who are union members, argued that a committee of trustees of the State University of New York had violated the law when it passed new teacher certification regulations on Wednesday. Under the new rules, the teachers could be certified after taking 160 hours of classroom instruction and doing 40 hours of teaching practice, rather than going through the lengthier process required of traditional public schoolteachers, who ultimately have to receive a master’s degree. The change had been sought by charter school leaders who have struggled to hire enough teachers to serve in their schools. The SUNY trustees took their authority for the change from a bit of legislative language inserted, as a result of a political deal, into a 2016 bill that renewed Mayor Bill de Blasio’s control of New York City schools. The language said that notwithstanding “any other provision of law, rule, or regulation to the contrary,” the SUNY committee that authorizes charters could “promulgate regulations with respect to governance, structure and operations of charter schools for which they are the charter entity.” The chair of the SUNY charter schools committee, Joseph W. Belluck, and charter school advocates, said that this meant the committee could enact regulations related to teacher certification. The unions, New York State United Teachers and the United Federation of Teachers argue in the lawsuit that such an interpretation would make the law unconstitutional, because the legislature cannot grant such broad power to an administrative agency. The unions also claim that the regulations violated the Charter School Act, which specifically caps the number of uncertified teachers that a charter school can employ at 15. Their lawsuit also argued that the committee violated the State Administrative Procedure Act, because it did not submit a revised version of the regulations for public comment. The lawsuit describes the regulations as putting in place “a watered down system for certifying teachers.” In an interview, Mr. Belluck said he believed the committee was on strong legal footing. “Our action yesterday falls within the grant that the legislature gave to us,” he said. “Not only did we follow the procedure that we needed to, I think that there was almost hyper-availability for participation from all stakeholders.” The new regulations have been criticized by the state education commissioner, MaryEllen Elia, and the chancellor of the Board of Regents, Betty A. Rosa, as well as the heads of education colleges.",The New York Times
2017,United Continental Shares Slip as Lower Profit Looms,"Shares of United Continental tumbled on Wall Street on Thursday, falling 12 percent to close at $59.78, as investors raised questions about the airline’s plan to take on lower-cost competitors. Although United reported better-than-expected earnings and profits in the third quarter, analysts said they were concerned about revenue for the rest of the year. The company said it expected a critical metric — revenue per available seat mile — to decline between 1 and 3 percent in the fourth quarter as it competes with low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines. United has been moving toward a stock market backlash for some time, said Jack Atkins, an airline analyst who is a managing director at Stephens Inc. When a new management team was installed last year, investors had a bullish outlook after the company outlined a plan to close the earnings gap with its main competitors, especially Delta Air Lines. But, Mr. Atkins said, that plan has not lived up to its promise. “The Street is really beginning to question management’s credibility here,” he said. “That’s never a good thing for the stock.” Part of United’s strategy is adding flights to its schedule, which many analysts view as superfluous. “Most investors would prefer to see United grow revenues through increasing price rather than adding seats to the market,” said Joseph DeNardi, a managing director and airline analyst at Stifel. Mr. Atkins said United was lowering fares to regain its market share in some of its hub cities, where low-cost carriers are infringing on its dominance. Oscar Munoz, the company’s chief executive, is under even greater pressure now after a year already defined by intense scrutiny of his performance. He has faced criticism for entering a price war with no-frills carriers, and for how he handled the rollout of the airline’s “basic economy” product. He is also seen as having been slow to respond when a passenger was violently pulled off a United flight in April — an incident that led some passengers to threaten to boycott the airline. During Thursday’s conference call with investors, Mr. Munoz asked for patience as the airline continued to work on a long-term plan to lower costs and increase profits. Over all, United’s stock is down 17 percent this year. Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, has seen a 5 percent increase, and American Airlines has gained 8 percent.",The New York Times
2017,United States Misses World Cup for First Time Since 1986,"Trinidad and Tobago 2, United States 1 COUVA, Trinidad and Tobago — There was always a chance that a year would come when the United States again failed to qualify for the World Cup, when the hurdles in the nearly two-year slog of regional qualification — the matches on steamy afternoons and muggy nights, the hard tackles and the coin-throwing fans, the lousy fields and the dubious refereeing — all proved too much. That year is 2017. Trinidad and Tobago, whose World Cup dreams ended months ago, stunned the United States, 2-1, on Tuesday night. The result, combined with just-as-shocking outcomes in two simultaneous games in Honduras and Panama on the final day of qualifying for the Concacaf region, ushered in the unthinkable: The American men, mainstays of the World Cup for more than a generation, are out of next summer’s tournament in Russia. Instead, Panama, which rallied from a one-goal deficit for a 2-1 win over Costa Rica, will join the Ticos and Mexico in Russia. It will be Panama’s first trip to the World Cup. How the United States Missed the World Cup, Minute by Minute Honduras, which overcame a two-goal deficit to beat visiting Mexico, 3-2, passed the Americans to claim fourth place in the six-team final round. That position comes with a World Cup lifeline: Honduras will face Australia in a two-leg playoff in November for a spot in the finals. The United States’ defeat capped a dramatic final day of qualifying on multiple continents, with France and Portugal locking up World Cup spots from Europe and three South American teams — Uruguay, Colombia and, with a monumental sigh of relief, Lionel Messi and Argentina — doing the same. The result in Trinidad and Tobago completed a slow-starting and, ultimately, devastating campaign for the United States. The path through qualifying had been full of pivotal moments; the team switched coaches after losing its first two qualifiers of the final round, firing Jurgen Klinsmann and rehiring Bruce Arena for a second stint leading the team. While Arena’s arrival initially seemed to steady the team, the Americans ultimately won only three of the eight qualifiers he coached. “We didn’t qualify for the World Cup,” Arena said after Tuesday’s loss. “That was my job.” He added: “We have no excuses. We failed today.” Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, echoed his coach’s disappointment. “We certainly expected to qualify, throughout the process, and especially after Friday night,” he said, adding, “It’s a huge disappointment for everybody; the players, the staff, the coaches, the federation. “It’s not good enough.” Gulati, who is expected to face his first contested election for the U.S. Soccer presidency in February, said he would make no decisions about the future of the program in the immediate aftermath of the defeat. “That’s for tomorrow,” he said. He declined to say whether Arena would coach the team through the end of his contract, which runs through the end of the 2018 World Cup. Arena and his team entered Tuesday’s game needing only a win or a tie to qualify, and — after a 4-0 win over Panama on Friday that kept the Americans in control of their qualification destiny — even a loss would have done the trick if the results in the other two games went the Americans’ way. But a listless first half on Tuesday put them back on perilous footing. Soon Panama and Honduras were rallying from early deficits, and then it all unraveled for the U.S. Trinidad and Tobago forward Shahdon Winchester and United States defender Omar Gonzalez converged on a looping cross in the penalty area in the 17th minute, and the hopeful ball knuckled off Winchester’s foot and Gonzalez’s shin before sailing over goalkeeper Tim Howard, who was caught off his line. The goal, a crestfallen Gonzalez said later, “is one that will haunt me forever.” The day, one Gonzalez called “the worst of my career,” soon got worse. Twenty minutes later, Trinidad and Tobago right back Alvin Jones, sauntering up the right side and looking for a passing option, realized he had no pressure and decided to shoot instead — a rocket from nearly 35 yards that screamed past Howard. The tiny crowd that bothered to show up to Ato Boldon Stadium roared again. The Americans had lost control of their fate, and suddenly needed goals — or help elsewhere — to save them. Christian Pulisic grabbed a goal back less than 90 seconds after halftime, and the press for one more — which would have been good enough to clinch qualification — was on. It never came, though, and despite Clint Dempsey’s hitting the post in the final minutes — one of several late chances that would have rescued the U.S. — the Americans were out. The defeat could mean the end of the national team careers of several national team mainstays, including Dempsey, 34, and Howard, 38. But those decisions, too, are for another day. On Tuesday night, there was just the hard truth of qualification. In international soccer, midfielder Michael Bradley had noted on Monday, “you either qualify for the World Cup, or you don’t. There’s no extra points for how you qualify.” There is no relying on other teams to help, either. So as the scores turned bad in the other two matches, and as the time ticked down on the tiny scoreboard at the stadium here, the increasingly desperate Americans could sense what was coming. Arena said he did not check the other scores, but Gonzalez said he could read the body language on the bench from his position on the field, and he knew the news wasn’t good. When the final whistle blew, Gonzalez and Bradley and the rest of the team were, for the first time since the 1986 World Cup, on the wrong side of the qualifying line. “The reality is that it was all there for us,” Bradley said. “And we have nobody to blame but ourselves.”",The New York Times
