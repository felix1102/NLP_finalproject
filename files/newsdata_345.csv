2018,Devastating Australia Bush Fire Destroys Scores of Homes,"SYDNEY, Australia — A devastating weekend fire that continued to rage into Monday consumed at least 69 homes in southern New South Wales, the state’s rural fire service said. The blaze began midday Sunday in Tarraganda, southeast of Bega, and quickly crossed the Bega River before advancing toward the seaside town of Tathra. Hundreds of its 1,600 residents fled to safety in Bega after receiving emergency alerts. As Monday morning dawned, aerial footage showed the still-smoking extent of the damage. No serious injuries or fatalities had been reported, but one woman was being treated for respiratory problems and burns, said Shane Fitzsimmons, the commissioner for the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. The blaze covered more than 1,000 hectares of land, or almost four square miles. It caused outages and disrupted cellphone service because of downed power lines and damaged cellular towers. The blaze comes amid increasing concern about extreme bush fires in southern and eastern Australia, with climate change and a paucity of rainfall believed to be behind the lengthening of the fire season from October through March. Shane Fitzsimmons, the commissioner for the state’s Rural Fire Service, said on 7 News Sydney that the fire was still not under control and called the situation “dangerous and dynamic.” Crews assessing the fire’s effects in the Tathra area found at least 69 homes destroyed and dozens more damaged, he said. Work crews were trying to get affected services like water, sewage and telecommunications up and running again, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. “The worst of the weather is behind us, but clearly the devastation, damage and destruction is what everyone’s seeking to grapple with now,” he said. While conditions had eased since Sunday, 63 firefighters and three firefighting planes were still in the field trying to manage the blaze, Greg Allan, a spokesman for the Rural Fire Service, said Monday morning. At the height of the fire, at least 150 firefighters were involved in the effort. Asbestos exposure was a concern, he said. “The firefighters will be using the better conditions today to have the fire contained as soon as possible,” Mr. Allan said. Residents in areas deemed safe were being allowed to return to their homes on Monday. Earlier in the day, at an evacuation center in Bega, more than 500 people had been anxiously waiting for updates. Speaking there, Kristy McBain, mayor of the Bega Valley Shire Council, commended fire and police crews, saying, “The evacuation was coordinated the best it could have been.” She said tightknit Tathra and Bega had already received hundreds of messages of support from people in surrounding communities offering help. “I’m sure that we’ll come through this fine,” Ms. McBain said. “We’re a very resilient community.” Still, for some of those affected, the damage seemed brutal. “It was all gone within half an hour,” John Blankenstein told The Sydney Morning Herald as he looked at the scorched remains of his wife’s childhood home. Other fires also raged in rural Victoria on Sunday, causing damage to at least 18 homes and 40 sheds and killing livestock in one of the season’s worst blazes.",The New York Times
2018,"Devonte Hart, Boy in Famous Photo, Feared Dead With Family in S.U.V. Plunge","They were the portrait of a modern family: a married female couple and their six adopted children. And in 2014, they were thrust in front of the world for all to see. One of those children — Devonte Hart, who is black — was photographed hugging a white police sergeant in Portland, Ore., during a 2014 demonstration to protest police violence. In the photograph, Devonte clung to the officer, a mix of fear and anguish in his eyes. But the intense news media coverage that followed may have been the reason the Hart family decided to flee to Washington State, the authorities said on Wednesday. Then, the unthinkable: The family’s sport utility vehicle plunged off a 100-foot cliff in Northern California and was discovered on Monday — upside down, engulfed by the waves of the Pacific Ocean. Both parents were found dead inside the S.U.V.; three of their children were discovered dead outside it; and the three other children, including Devonte, were still missing on Wednesday evening and feared dead, law enforcement officials said. “We have every indication to believe that all six children were in there, however only three bodies have been recovered,” said Sheriff Tom Allman of Mendocino County. “We have no evidence and no reason to believe this was an intentional act. Certainly people are wondering what caused this.” Still, the authorities did not discount the possibility that some of the children may have been staying with friends. At a news conference on Wednesday, Sheriff Allman conceded that many questions remain: When did the “accident,” as he called it, occur? Why did the S.U.V. drive across at least 75 feet of dirt before plummeting into the ocean? Why weren’t there skid marks? Sheriff Allman said his office knew of no witnesses. In the meantime, troubling reports about the family have emerged. Washington State Child Protective Services learned on Friday of allegations of abuse against the Harts and tried to make contact with them that day, but no one answered when its employees visited their home, Norah West, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Social and Health Services, said on Wednesday. Ms. West said that Child Protective Services had opened the inquiry because of “allegations of abuse or neglect in the home.” She said the children’s agency made two subsequent attempts to establish contact with the family, visiting the home again on Monday and Tuesday, but was unsuccessful. A spokesman for the Clark County Sheriff’s Department in Washington State said he was not aware of any previous interactions with the family. A neighbor of the Harts in Woodland, Wash., Dana DeKalb, told the NBC affiliate KGW that Devonte, the child from the 2014 photograph, had recently begun venturing over to her home to ask for food, sometimes several times a day. According to Ms. DeKalb, Devonte said his mothers sometimes withheld food from the children as punishment and disallowed them from going outside. Ms. DeKalb said she was the one who brought the family to the attention of Child Protective Services. She told KGW that when the children’s agency visited on Friday, the Harts refused to answer the door, and that the family left only hours later. Ms. DeKalb did not immediately respond to a telephone message on Wednesday night. Publicly available records show that Sarah Hart had lived in Minnesota for years before eventually moving to West Linn, Ore., and finally Woodland, Wash. Court records show that she was convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault in Minnesota in 2011. A copy of the complaint obtained by The New York Times shows Sarah Hart had also initially been charged with one count of “malicious punishment of child.” The complaint says Sarah Hart admitted spanking one of her children, who was 6 years old at the time. “The defendant admitted that she let her anger get out of control,” the complaint said. The child was found to have had marks on her stomach, which Sarah Hart acknowledged probably came from the girl having been bent over the edge of a bathtub while being spanked, the complaint said. The crash was discovered Monday afternoon by a passer-by who had used a pullout along the road and saw a vehicle off the embankment on the rocky shoreline. Deputies were sent to that area, called Juan Creek, along Highway 1, more than 500 miles from the Harts’ home. Investigators soon found the vehicle and the bodies, identifying the two adults as Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 38, of Woodland, Wash. By Wednesday, coroner’s officials had identified the bodies of the three children: Markis, 19; Jeremiah, 14; and Abigail, 14. The authorities say the three missing children are: Devonte, 15; Hannah, 16; and Sierra, 15. In 2014, Devonte was photographed at a demonstration in Portland, Ore., one of many protests across the country of a grand jury’s decision not to bring criminal charges against Darren Wilson, the police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Devonte, who was then 12, had been holding a “Free Hugs” sign, and a police officer, Sgt. Bret Barnum, approached him to ask why he was crying. The photograph of the two embracing, which was first published by The Oregonian, ricocheted around social media and was featured by major news media outlets. In an interview at the time with The Oregonian, Sergeant Barnum said the boy told him that he was sad “about the protests, kind of about national events.” “I just kind of sighed,” he recalled, “and said, ‘I’m sorry.’” An earlier version of a home screen headline referring to this article overstated what was known about the crash. Although all eight family members are feared dead, that has not been confirmed, as the article noted. An earlier version of this article, using information provided by the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office, incorrectly stated Sierra Hart’s age at the time of the crash. She was 15 years old, not 12.",The New York Times
2018,"Dia Acquires ‘Sun Tunnels,’ Its First Piece of Land Art by a Woman","The newly formed Holt-Smithson Foundation has made its first move to secure the legacy of the pioneering land artist Nancy Holt (1938-2014), better known for safeguarding the work of her husband, Robert Smithson, after he died in 1973 than for promoting her own. Holt’s monumental “Sun Tunnels” (1973-76), sited in the Great Basin Desert in Utah, has just been acquired by the Dia Art Foundation — its first such work by a woman. The combination gift and purchase from the Holt-Smithson Foundation also includes Holt’s room-size installation “Holes of Light” (1973), to be exhibited in September at Dia:Chelsea. “We’re hoping the urban exhibition will encourage people to think about going out to the Great Basin Desert,” said Lisa Le Feuvre, executive director of the foundation responsible for the estates of Holt and Smithson. Jessica Morgan, director of the Dia foundation, described the work’s appeal as both ancient and modern. “‘Sun Tunnels’ is a work that reaches back to a Renaissance fascination with astronomy but has a very contemporary physicality,” she said. Four concrete hollow cylinders — each 18 feet long and 9 feet in diameter and perforated with a constellation of small apertures emitting patterns of light inside the tube — are arranged in the landscape in an open cross. The view through the tunnels frames the vast desert and is perfectly aligned with the setting sun during the summer and winter solstices. “It tracks the environment for you as the sun moves across the landscape, even if you aren’t there at a solstice,” Ms. Morgan said. The choice to partner with Dia seemed obvious, said Ms. Le Feuvre. In 1999, Holt had facilitated the donation of Smithson’s 1970 work “Spiral Jetty” — a 1,500-foot coil of black basalt and dirt rising out of Utah’s Great Salt Lake — to the collection of Dia. That foundation serves as the steward of seven other site-specific artworks around the world, beginning more than 40 years ago with Walter De Maria’s 1977 “Lightning Field” in New Mexico. “How much a work of land art is worth is a very difficult thing to assess,” said Ms. Morgan. “Ownership is really the care-taking of the project and the protection of the artist’s wish.” For “Sun Tunnels,” that means engaging a conservator to make regular visits, preserving unobstructed sight lines around the piece, making sure the roads leading to it are accessible and providing clear instructions on Dia’s website for how to find it. Both Holt and Smithson were averse to any signage in the landscape directing visitors, said Ms. Morgan: “The process of finding the work, that journey, is part of the piece.”",The New York Times
2018,Dial P for Privacy: The Phone Booth Is Back,"For much of the 20th century, the phone booth was a steadfast and essential installation of modern life, from bustling cities to tumbleweed-strewn desert gas stations. Tippi Hedren was attacked in one in “The Birds,” Clark Kent frequently changed to Superman in one and Bill & Ted used one to time-travel on their excellent adventure. In “The Matrix,” a phone booth was a portal — an exit device from the digital realm. But to lay eyes upon a phone booth now — be it the charming old jungle-green one tucked in the back of the restaurant Indochine, in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, or one of the four remaining sidewalk booths on the city’s Upper West Side — is to glimpse a relic of a seemingly ancient civilization. As mobile phone use exploded and the pay phone was increasingly linked to crime, the booth began to disappear. At the same time, workplaces saw the rise of the open floor plan. We all saw (and heard) a proliferation of mobile phones, and with it, the irritating, distracting sound of a one-sided conversation from your cubicle mate. Lauren Emberson, then a psychology Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University, called it a “halfalogue.” As she put it in the publication Psychological Science: “I really felt like I couldn’t do anything else when someone was on a cellphone. I couldn’t read. I couldn’t even listen to my music.” Now, the phone booth — or at least a variation of it — is making a modest comeback. When the women-only club and work space The Wing opened its first location in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in October of 2016, the interior featured marble tables, pink velvet couches, and one small, windowless, reflective glass-doored room dubbed the Phone Booth. One year later, when another location of The Wing opened in Soho, eight built-in, glass-doored call rooms were included in the design. Audrey Gelman, one of the founders of The Wing, explained that the increase in phone booths came “as a direct result of member feedback.” But these aren’t grimy street cubicles or sterile, forbidding isolation chambers. “Each room is named after our favorite fictional female characters — like Ramona Quimby, Lieutenant Uhura, and Lisa Simpson — and provides members with a quiet space for private conversation,” Ms. Gelman said. Each tiny space is equipped with a power outlet, a shallow shelf, a stool and a quaint, nonfunctional — but highly Instagrammable — retro telephone. (A third location of The Wing, in Dumbo, which opened earlier this month, has four phone booths hidden behind bookshelves, Clue-style.) Five new, maple-sided, portable, modular Zenbooth phone booths were installed late last year at the 17th Street headquarters of Gizmodo Media Group, the home of several websites, including Deadspin, Lifehacker, Jezebel and Splinter (where this reporter was previously employed). But because approximately 230 employees work out of the GMG headquarters, the booths are frequently occupied by writers and editors looking to make a private call. Thus, the company’s facilities manager, Will Sansom, recently ordered four additional Zenbooths — including one two-seater that acts a small stand-alone meeting room — explaining that there has been “positively positive feedback across the board.” Other companies that have recently purchased Zenbooths include Volkswagen, Lyft, Meetup and Capital One. The Berkeley, Calif., company was launched in 2016, and its products range from $3,995 (for a standard one-person booth) to $15,995 (for a two-person “executive” booth). The one-person booth is a soundproof, eco-friendly, American-made box that’s about 36 inches wide and 34 inches deep, with an insulated glass door, a ventilation fan, power outlets and a skylight — and it can be assembled in roughly an hour. (It does not, however, contain an actual phone.) Sam Johnson, a co-founder of the company, said it produced “hundreds” of Zenbooths a month in 2017. This year, it’s on track to quadruple that production. But he doesn’t call them phone booths. “We’re manufacturing quiet spaces and privacy,” he said. Zenbooth is not the only free-standing office phone booth in the game. Companies like Cubicall, Nomad, and TalkBox, among others, are offering up solutions to the modern office’s privacy problem. The Cubicall, which starts at $6,495, allows businesses to customize the exterior wall with a design or logo; the Nomad, priced at $2995, is partially made from recycled plastic bottles, and TalkBox, which starts at $4,500, has whiteboard walls for writing notes and ideas on the spot and counts companies both large (Google) and small (Ipsy, the cosmetics subscription service) among its clients. But doesn’t installing a free-standing phone booth in your company’s sleek office admit some kind of failure of planning? Yes, says Nikil Saval, the co-editor of n+1 magazine and the author of “Cubed: A Secret History Of The Workplace.” “There has rarely been a premium placed on privacy for American office workers,” Mr. Saval said in a phone interview, noting that while cubicles cut down on visual distractions, “you still have to deal with noise, and noise travels pretty easily. It’s an incredibly common problem in open office plans.” Added Mr. Saval: “The clearest instance of how much of a problem it is? People put on headphones all the time. Headphones have become the new walls. It’s also a signal: Don’t disturb me. Because you’re constantly surrounded by other people, and you’re cheek to jowl, just crammed in with other people.” Mr. Saval said surveys have shown that while workers overwhelmingly prefer private offices to open-plan arrangements or cubicles — where they are often forced to hear a co-worker make dinner reservations, check in on the babysitter or, most awkwardly, argue with a significant other — there are economic forces that take precedence. “There are no measurable benefits as far as human interaction, sociability, running into each other, serendipitous encounters,” he said of the open floor plan. “It’s just cheaper, and that’s why it exists."" Thus, the return of the phone booth signals a gesture toward more civility. Talking on the phone for others to overhear, especially in a work environment, has become at best an etiquette issue, and at worst, what Mr. Saval calls a pollutant. However small the footprint, the option for privacy is welcome. As Ms. Gelman put it, “Sometimes you just need a minute to yourself.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Dictators Love Trump, and He Loves Them","Nicholas Kristof If you’re a murderous dictator, this is a joyous time to be alive. No one will make much of a fuss if your opposition leader is jailed, if an annoying journalist goes missing or if, as happened in Congo, a judge who displeases the dictatorial president suffers a home invasion in which goons rape his wife and daughter. As President Trump replaces Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with the more hawkish Mike Pompeo, let’s note something that goes far beyond personnel to the heart of the American role in the world: The U.S. has abandoned a bipartisan consensus on human rights that goes back decades. I’m back from Myanmar, where leaders are finding that this is also the optimal time to commit genocide. The army conducted a scorched-earth campaign against the Rohingya ethnic minority, with soldiers throwing babies onto bonfires as they raped the mothers. What has Trump said to condemn Myanmar for these atrocities? Essentially nothing. In the past, human rights was at least one thread of our foreign policy. This was pursued inconsistently, grudgingly or hypocritically, and it jostled constantly with realpolitik considerations, but in the past it was one of the factors in play. I periodically assailed Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush for not doing more after atrocities in Syria, Darfur or South Sudan, but both Obama and Bush were clearly anguished and frustrated that they didn’t have better tools to stop the slaughter. In contrast, President Trump seems simply indifferent. Trump defended Vladimir Putin for killing critics (“What? You think our country’s so innocent?”), and praised Egypt’s brutal president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, for “a fantastic job.” Trump hailed the Philippines’s president, Rodrigo Duterte, whose dirty war on drugs has claimed 12,000 lives, for an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.” Sarah Margon of Human Rights Watch notes in Foreign Affairs that when Trump visited Manila, he laughed as Duterte called reporters “spies” — in a country where aggressive journalism has landed people in the morgue. “In country after country, the Trump administration is gutting U.S. support for human rights,” Margon writes. So dictators see a clear field: A record number of journalists are in prison worldwide, by the count of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Joel Simon, the organization’s executive director, says Trump has met with the leaders of each of the three top jailers of journalists — China, Russia and Turkey — and as far as we know, has never raised the issue of press freedom with them. “What’s completely gone is the bipartisan consensus that was a cornerstone of our foreign policy, that if you imprison journalists and restrict the media, there will be consequences,” Simon says. In Cambodia, Prime Minister Hun Sen approvingly cited Trump’s attacks on fake news as a precedent for closing down radio stations and the much admired newspaper Cambodia Daily. After the crackdown, in November, Trump posed for a photograph with Hun Sen, flashing a thumbs-up — and Hun Sen praised the American president for his lack of interest in human rights. “Your policy is being changed,” Hun Sen declared gratefully, and he lauded Trump for being “most respectful.” Trump told the king of repressive Bahrain, “there won’t be strain with this administration.” Nabeel Rajab, a heroic Bahraini who is one of the Arab world’s leading human rights campaigners, says the government responded a few days later by killing five protesters — and, just last month, the government followed up again by sentencing Rajab himself to five years in prison for his tweets. Trump’s soft spot for authoritarianism goes way back. He has spoken sympathetically of the Chinese government’s massacres of pro-democracy protesters in 1989, and of Saddam Hussein’s approach to counterterrorism. Important human rights jobs in the administration aren’t even filled, although some conservatives are rallying support for the appointment of Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, which would be a good first step. Periodically, Trump does raise human rights issues, but only to bludgeon enemies like North Korea or Venezuela. This is so ham-handed and hypocritical that it simply diminishes American standing further. In some respects, Trump has united the world. Against us. A recent Gallup poll shows that across 134 countries, approval of the United States has collapsed to a record low of 30 percent. Indeed, more people now approve of China than of the United States. Russia is just behind us. “Trump has been a disaster for U.S. soft power,” says Gary Bass of Princeton University. “He’s so hated around the world that he’s radioactive. So on those rare occasions when he does something about human rights, it only tarnishes the cause.” This is a tragedy for the United States. But the greatest loss is felt by people who are helpless as loved ones are raped, tortured or murdered. In Myanmar, a young Rohingya man pleaded with me: “Please don’t let us be treated as animals. Please. Please. Don’t break our trust.” What do we tell him?☐ OpinionNicholas Kristof OpinionNicholas Kristof OpinionNicholas Kristof",The New York Times
2018,"Did Melania Trump Merit an ‘Einstein Visa’? Probably, Immigration Lawyers Say","It is known as the “Einstein visa.” Nuclear scientists, Nobel laureates and doctors get it. But so do acrobats, stunt men, event planners — and plenty of models. Each year, thousands of foreigners try to persuade government officials that they are among the best in their field. The prize if they succeed: a green card, and with it, the right to live permanently in the United States. Reports that the first lady, Melania Trump, received an immigrant visa reserved for “individuals with extraordinary ability” in 2001, when she was a model, have thrust the EB-1 visa program into the spotlight. The news, first reported by The Washington Post, raised questions about whether Mrs. Trump had truly qualified for the visa. But several immigration lawyers rebuffed those questions, saying the requirements for the EB-1 immigrant visa leave far more room for interpretation than its nickname and its best-and-brightest reputation suggest. While the program may be the pinnacle of the merit-based immigration policies supported by critics of the visa lottery and family-based migration — indeed, by President Trump himself — the decision of what constitutes merit, while based on established criteria, is ultimately subjective and often surprising. “Recipients are supposed to be the best of the best,” said Rita Sostrin, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who has written extensively about EB-1s, “but meeting the criteria is no guarantee. An adjudication officer makes a judgment call.” The “extraordinary ability” immigrant visa category is one of the few visas for which an applicant does not require an employer or family sponsor. Only 5,530 people received a green card through that program in the fiscal year that ended in September 2016, the latest for which data is available, out of some one million issued. In 2001, when Mrs. Trump got hers, even fewer were granted. Marshall Cohen, a lawyer in Atlanta who specializes in EB-1s for world-ranked track and field athletes, said that he would not have hesitated to represent Mrs. Trump. “I am assuming she made a lot of money, got a lot of press and was on the cover of magazines,” he said. “She was probably a pretty easy case.” Mrs. Trump, then Melania Knauss, appeared on the cover of British GQ in 2000, the year she petitioned for the EB-1, and was featured in Sports Illustrated and other magazines later that year. “Do we need more foreign fashion models? Some might say no,” said Mr. Cohen, who led a panel titled “Proving Extraordinary Ability Is Extraordinarily Challenging” at a recent immigration lawyers’ conference. “We might need more chemical engineers. But if there is a fashion model at the top of her field, she could qualify.” Petitioners for the EB-1, which was created as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, face a two-part test. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services first must determine whether a candidate has presented evidence to satisfy three out of 10 criteria, such as publishing material in professional publications or other major media, appearing in artistic exhibitions or commanding a high salary. Once those are met, the decision comes down to a vague and undefined “final merits determination” by the immigration agency. “That is the mystery; nobody knows what it is,” said Ms. Sostrin, the lawyer in Los Angeles, who recently secured EB-1s for an award-winning stunt performer and a high-end events planner. What is clear is that extraordinary intelligence is not necessary — nor sufficient on its own — to get one. Indeed, even Albert Einstein might have not qualified for an EB-1 before winning the Nobel Prize. A few years ago, Ms. Sostrin distributed a résumé to immigration lawyers at a conference without revealing that it was Einstein’s, or at least one devised from his career accomplishments. Ms. Sostrin asked them to assess the likelihood that he would be approved for an extraordinary ability visa. The consensus was that it would be very challenging: The résumé, for a tutor and patent examiner turned professor, listed only a handful of the most important scientific works Einstein had published by 1920, more than a decade into his academic career. “The notion that you somehow have to be a genius or Einstein is utter fiction,” said Chris Wright, a lawyer based in Los Angeles. “We have succeeded with models no more accomplished than Melania Trump.” While the majority of applicants and recipients have titles like “space scientist,” “cancer researcher” and “software engineer,” many have less scholarly pursuits. In 2012, Mr. Wright represented Shera Béchard, a Canadian model and Playboy Playmate who successfully petitioned for an EB-1. In her petition, Mr. Wright included scantily clad photographs of Ms. Béchard. “When it’s a glamorous model and pictures show cleavage rather than research, people assume there is something underhanded going on,” said Mr. Wright, who said that he had also obtained the visas for a racecar driver, a hair dresser and a tennis player. For Glenn Boswell, a stunt performer and director used to jumping out of buildings and moving vehicles, getting the EB-1 was a relative cake walk. His lawyer filed a 439-page petition in 2016 detailing Mr. Boswell’s achievements, which include credits in “Unbroken,” “The Matrix” and “The Hobbit,” and he received approval within a week. “I was really excited when it came,” Mr. Boswell, 60, said in a phone interview from his native Australia. He had no idea he had joined an exclusive club. Daniel Riffner, 35, an acrobat for Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas, compiled a dossier in 2009 about his 25-year career, packed with medals, pictures of his high-wire acts and recommendations from coaches. Kinan Azmeh, 41, a Syrian clarinetist in Brooklyn who is a member of Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road Ensemble, applied in 2012. Both received green cards. Mr. Trump has championed an immigration overhaul that would replace the current family-based system, which he derides as “chain migration,” with one based on merit, emphasizing skill and educational level. His proposal would have made it impossible for the first lady to sponsor her parents for a green card, which she did after obtaining permanent legal residency and becoming a citizen herself. Meanwhile, highly skilled people, whether scientists or entrepreneurs, often get turned down when they apply to work and live in the country. Especially under the Trump administration, immigration lawyers said, U.S.C.I.S. has made a habit of making requests for further evidence before deciding the fate of an applicant. The lawyers also said that scholars and scientists have a tougher time winning approval than models, actors and athletes. Elissa Taub, a lawyer in Memphis who secured the EB-1 for the German gymnast, said that some of her denials “burn me to this day,” like that of a nuclear astrophysicist who had produced groundbreaking work at a national lab. Immigration officials said his title on the job was not senior enough to merit the EB-1. “We lost a great scientific mind due to this crazy decision,” she said of the scholar, who returned to India. In another case, U.S.C.I.S. acknowledged that a Chinese researcher had fulfilled three criteria to qualify, but that “scientists who have risen to the very top of the field have garnered citations numbered in the thousands,” not in the hundreds, as he had shown. He was denied. Despite ample documentation and detailed letters from world-renowned experts supporting the petition of a molecular oncologist who studies drug-resistant cancer, U.S.C.I.S. questioned whether her scholarship was significant. After her lawyer submitted further evidence, she was approved. “These are people we should be rolling out the red carpet for,” said David Soloway, the lawyer who handled the case. “Most people would readily say that it makes sense for someone who is extraordinarily skilled in the sciences to be admitted to this country,” Mr. Soloway added. “But in modeling? Really?” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Albert Einstein’s record of scientific publication. By 1920, he had published more than 200 works, not a handful. The résumé based on his career to that point that was distributed to immigration lawyers at a conference included seven of his important works, not all he had published.",The New York Times

2018,Digging Out From a Snowy Spring Day,"Like a bad houseguest, the nor’easter left behind a mess. The day after the big storm — the fourth this month alone — its presence continued to lurk in the slushy sidewalks, downed trees and longer-than-normal commutes across the New York region and beyond. Roads remained closed from flooding or debris. Schools and offices opened late, if at all. Stranded travelers scrambled to find their way home after the storm forced the cancellation of thousands of flights at airports from Washington to Boston, and disrupted train and bus services. Others woke up in their own beds, but with no heat or power. There were at least two storm-related deaths on Long Island, where one woman suffered a heart attack while shoveling snow and another woman died when a van overturned in a crash, according to news reports. In New York City, the nor’easter was anticipated as the biggest spring snowstorm in the city’s history — a record held by a 10-inch blizzard on April 3, 1915 — but fell short in the end. The official tally, taken in Central Park, was 8.4 inches, though more fell in other neighborhoods, with Queens Village topping the list at 14.5 inches. Even so, the nor’easter did set one record: the most snow seen on March 21. The old record was 7.1 inches in 1958. “Hopefully, it’s the last one,” said Mark Mito, 29, a finance manager for an auto sales company in Brooklyn as he helped clear snow off the cars. “I don’t know what season it is right now. I’m kind of confused.” Even before the slow-moving storm blanketed the region Wednesday, police and emergency crews stepped up their efforts. As of Thursday morning, New Jersey State Police had responded to 516 accidents over two days. Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, acting commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation, said 3,800 plows and trucks loaded with de-icing agents were deployed during the storm. “Yesterday was a very smooth day for us in terms of being able to plow,” she said. Snowfall reached at least 10 inches in more than a dozen New Jersey counties, with a high of 15 inches in Lacey Township in Ocean County, according to the National Weather Service. More than 86,000 New Jersey homes were without power early Thursday, of which more than half were in the Atlantic City area, according to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. By afternoon, 72,000 homes remained dark. Still, Gov. Philip D. Murphy said that the number of homes without power were less than a third of what they had been during the last storm. “We have to be committed like heck to make sure we get everybody back on,” he said at a news conference in Woodbridge. In New York City, the public school system reopened on time, and there were no residual storm-related problems reported for the subways and buses during the morning commute. The Long Island Rail Road was also largely back to normal. Natalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that cleanup efforts were well underway. “A snowstorm on the first day of spring is a good reminder that anything can happen, but we’re always prepared,” she said. “We’re still doing some snow-clearing and spot-checking around the city, but thanks to a full-force, nonstop effort by city workers — and slightly warmer temperatures — the streets are looking good, and we expect to be fully back to normal soon.” Outside the city, many suburban communities were also recovering quickly, in part because the storm’s slow approach had allowed for preparations. On Long Island, where the snow topped 20.1 inches in Patchogue, the heaviest snowfall came overnight. Road crews worked through the night to ensure the roads were clear for the morning commute. “This spring storm demonstrates the difficulty of predicting weather, and what we try to do is err on the side of caution and public safety,” said Steven Bellone, the Suffolk County executive. New York State transportation workers kept open miles of highway lanes in the Long Island region during the storm, according to Joseph Brown, a regional director for the transportation department. They used more than 300 plow trucks, some of which were sent from upstate. “We didn’t expect to have a very mild February or a very tough March,” he said. “You never know what’s going to hit you.” In a statement, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that state’s aggressive preparations had paid off, with a full force of emergency workers strategically deployed and utility companies required to have a storm-response plan in place. “This weather is clearly the new normal and New Yorkers should know that no matter what Mother Nature throws our way, we will always remain vigilant and do whatever is necessary to keep people safe,” he said. Some New Yorkers reveled in the aftereffect of the nor’easter. Mads Jakob Poulsen, 35, a graphic designer, let his 4-year-old pit bull, Astro, sprint across the snow at Herbert Von King Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn — in clear violation of a “No Pets” sign. “It’s a little bit like alternate-side parking: When that’s off, this is off, too,” he said. But for others, the brief snowy interlude was over. Sanjay Gupta, 55, a Verizon field technician on Long Island, was on his way to make a repair early Thursday morning. “I figure about 80 percent of the other field techs called in today for a personal day,” he said. “But I didn’t.”",The New York Times
2018,Dior Confirms Kim Jones as Men’s Wear Artistic Director,"LONDON — The British designer Kim Jones was confirmed as the new artistic director of Dior Homme on Monday, two months after he stepped down as artistic director of men’s wear at Louis Vuitton. He will replace Kris Van Assche, who was in the role 11 years. The creative reshuffling and the hiring of Mr. Jones, who will start April 1, are the first major strategic decisions by Pietro Beccari, chief executive of Christian Dior Couture, who joined the brand from Fendi in November. The news will probably heighten speculation about the future of Maria Grazia Chiuri, the fashion house’s artistic director of women’s wear, whose tenure has received mixed reviews. And it comes just days after another major fashion house, Nina Ricci, said its creative director of three years, Guillaume Henry, was stepping down. The announcement on Monday ends feverish speculation about Mr. Jones’s next move. The news of his appointment came minutes after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury conglomerate that owns both Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, said that Mr. Van Assche would be leaving Dior. Mr. Van Assche will, however, remain in the LVMH group, a statement said, in a role that has yet to be announced. “I am delighted to welcome Kim Jones at Dior Homme,” Mr. Beccari said in a statement, adding that Mr. Jones would “create an elegant men’s wardrobe both classic and anchored in contemporary culture.” “I am confident that he will continue to further develop Dior Homme on a global scale,” Mr. Beccari added. There had been much speculation in recent months about where Mr. Jones would go after his unexpected departure from Louis Vuitton in January, although it recently emerged that he would stay in the LVMH stable. Mr. Jones, a graduate of the London art and design school Central Saint Martins, held his position at Louis Vuitton for seven years and had at one stage been tipped for the top creative job at Burberry before it was given to Riccardo Tisci. He will present his first collection for Dior Homme in June, during Paris men’s fashion week. “I am deeply honored to join the house of Dior, a symbol of the ultimate elegance,” Mr. Jones said. “I am committed to create a modern and innovative male silhouette built upon the unique legacy of the house.” In his previous role, Mr. Jones was widely applauded for revitalizing the Louis Vuitton men’s wear line for a younger generation, mixing the house’s travel heritage, which sits at the highest end of the price spectrum, with a more street-friendly style. His previous position remains unfilled, although there was much discussion during Paris fashion week last month over whether Virgil Abloh, the American designer behind the Off-White label, might be tapped for the role. Dior does not break out revenue for its men’s business. However, Christian Dior Couture posted overall revenue of 2.23 billion euros, or $2.7 billion, last year. In April, LVMH took control of Christian Dior Couture in a $13 billion deal, simplifying a complex ownership structure under which Dior was the parent company of the group. An earlier version of this article misstated overall revenue last year at Christian Dior Couture. It was 2.23 billion euros, or $2.7 billion, not €43.7 billion. slide show",The New York Times
2018,Diplomatic Fireworks at U.N. Over Britain-Russia Feud,"UNITED NATIONS — Britain called an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday to formally accuse Russia of trying to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil with a military-grade nerve agent. The March 4 attack in the British cathedral town of Salisbury was “indiscriminate and reckless,” Ambassador Jonathan Allen said, part of what he suggested was a pattern of Russian misbehavior that had become a threat to international peace and security. He received unequivocal support from his American counterpart, Nikki R. Haley, who, unlike her boss, President Trump, has bluntly rebuked Russia on a range of topics. “Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent,” Ms. Haley said, calling the poisoning “an atrocious crime.” The Security Council session was unusual. Permanent members of the council do not normally accuse one another of what under certain circumstances could be construed as acts of war. The former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned on March 4 with what British investigators have identified as Novichok, a potent nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Russia has denied any connection to the poisoning. The nerve agent “is not a weapon that can be manufactured by nonstate actors,” Mr. Allen said. He accused Russia of maintaining supplies of the agent, despite declaring in 2017 that it had destroyed all of its chemical weapons stockpiles. “A weapon so horrific that it is banned from use in war was used in a peaceful city in my country,” Mr. Allen said. The Security Council session appeared to be part of a broad effort by the British government to marshal the support of allies for a robust response to Russia. Hours earlier, Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, expelled 23 Russians she said were spies and suspended high-level contacts between Moscow and London. Despite the deepening diplomatic crisis, it was not clear what further action the British could take to penalize Russia at the United Nations. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia could veto any resolution intended to punish it. Past efforts to hold Russia accountable for international misdeeds — the poisoning of a former spy in London in 2006 with a radioactive isotope, or the downing of a passenger plane over Ukraine in 2014 — went almost nowhere. Judging by the reactions of Russian officials and government-run news media to the latest accusations, few expect to face serious consequences this time. After Mr. Allen and Ms. Haley had spoken, Russia’s ambassador, Vasily A. Nebenzya, responded with mockery and sarcasm. He accused the British government of acting like Inspector Lestrade, the hapless detective from the Arthur Conan Doyle novels who is constantly upstaged by Sherlock Holmes. Ms. Haley, meanwhile, was clearly “an experienced chemist” to be so certain of her conclusions, Mr. Nebenzya said. Then he suggested that Britain had the most to gain from the poisoning by using it in a “black P.R.” campaign to harm Moscow’s reputation ahead of the 2018 World Cup, which Russia is hosting in three months. “The authorities of the United Kingdom are constantly trying to tarnish Russia,” he said. In her remarks, Ms. Haley acknowledged that Russia’s behavior is a frequent topic for the United States and its allies at the United Nations. “We take no pleasure in having to constantly criticize Russia,” she said. “But we need Russia to stop giving us so many reasons to do so.”",The New York Times
2018,Dirk Nowitzki Plans to Play for Mavericks Next Season,"With just nine games to go in one of the most difficult seasons of his career, Dirk Nowitzki gave his strongest indication yet that he plans to return to the Dallas Mavericks in 2018-19 for his 21st N.B.A. campaign. “As of now, I’m planning to come back,” Nowitzki said in an interview with The New York Times this week. “I feel great. I’ve only missed one game all season. I signed a two-year contract because I wanted to play two more years. And here we are.” An official decision on whether to invoke the 2018-19 player option on the two-year, $10 million contract he signed in July 2017 will not be made until the off-season. First, Nowitzki plans to step away from the game next month, huddle with his wife, Jessica, and his longtime German shooting coach and adviser, Holger Geschwindner, about the future, and undergo a thorough examination of his health. But Nowitzki has suggested on numerous occasions this season that, despite Dallas’s struggles, he would like to play next season if his health cooperates. That would give Nowitzki sole possession of the N.B.A. record for the longest continuous run with the same team, passing Kobe Bryant, who played 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers. At 22-51, Dallas is enduring first 50-loss season of Nowitzki’s career. Nowitzki led the Mavericks to the N.B.A. championship in 2011, and the team has posted a dozen 50-win seasons since acquiring him on draft night in 1998. Although his movement has clearly been labored at times this season, Nowitzki continues to be an effective offensive player, despite operating almost exclusively as a center now after he was widely credited for changing the way the power forward position is played. Nowitzki, who turns 40 in June, entered Tuesday just 281 points short of surpassing Wilt Chamberlain (31,149 points) for the fifth spot on the N.B.A.’s career scoring list. He’s averaging 12.2 points and 5.6 rebounds, shooting nearly 42 percent from 3-point range and better than 90 percent from the free-throw line.",The New York Times
2018,"Disability Led to Tenure Denial at City College, Lawsuit Claims","When the City College of New York hired Lynda G. Dodd almost a decade ago to help lead a new undergraduate program, underwritten by the Skadden Arps law firm, to promote diversity in the legal profession, it hailed her as “head and shoulders above the rest of the candidates.” But Dr. Dodd, who has degrees from Princeton and Yale, was later found to have multiple sclerosis, and she was denied early tenure after concerns arose over the pace of her scholarly output. Now, Dr. Dodd, who has established a national reputation researching remedies for civil rights violations, contends that her own rights have been violated, and she has filed a lawsuit charging retaliation prohibited by disability discrimination laws. At many colleges, the tenure process can be fraught, shaped by competing egos and academic infighting. But the process is usually closely held, making Dr. Dodd’s lawsuit a rare instance in which private grievances are being aired in the public domain. Filed in late December in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the lawsuit comes at a turbulent time for City College, in Harlem, as well as its parent institution, the City University of New York. Lisa S. Coico, the college’s former president, has been under federal investigation by the United States attorney for the Eastern District. Her replacement, Vincent G. Boudreau, was named permanent president in December, but only after overcoming objections from neighborhood activists and politicians. But Dr. Dodd claims that Dr. Boudreau, a political scientist, has played a key adversarial role, and is now the college’s final arbiter, as president, of her future at City College. CUNY is searching for a new chancellor after James B. Milliken unexpectedly announced that he would step down at the end of the academic year. A CUNY spokesman declined to comment, citing the litigation. The state Attorney General’s office, which is defending the university, is scheduled to respond by Wednesday. Neither Dr. Dodd nor her lawyer, Anne L. Clark, with the employment law firm of Vladeck, Raskin & Clark, would comment. But in an unusual display of support, 50 political scientists who focus on law and courts wrote to Dr. Boudreau and Mr. Milliken, praising Dr. Dodd’s work and calling the tenure decision “a manifest injustice.” “The reaction I got was — you’ve got to be kidding,” said Charles R. Epp, a University of Kansas professor who spoke at City College forum in 2012, and helped organize the letter-writing effort. “She writes as if she’s a much more senior scholar, and her contribution is equal to that of many senior scholars.” Dr. Dodd, 49, has a Ph.D. in politics from Princeton, and a law degree from Yale. After serving as a law professor at American University, she came to City College in 2010 to bolster a new, high-profile program, the Skadden Arps Honors Program in Legal Studies, to help prepare more students from underrepresented backgrounds for legal careers. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom contributed $9.6 million, and Dr. Dodd received a higher-than-usual salary as the Joseph H. Flom Professor of Legal Studies. But, in an unusual move for named professorships, the position was not automatically tenured. A Skadden spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. But some former students hold her in high esteem. “She was regarded as a tough professor, but fair,” said Joel Sati, 24, who is now pursuing a doctorate at the University of California at Berkeley and a law degree at Yale. “You know ‘The Paper Chase’? Kind of like Kingsfield, but a much lighter version.” But Dr. Dodd experienced numerous health setbacks after 2010, as her progressive “M.S. symptoms worsened, including declining mobility, extreme fatigue, and a severe form of pain,” her lawsuit claimed. Yet “her efforts to obtain a reasonable accommodation of additional time to complete her research were met with hostility and obstruction,” the suit said. Part of the complaint involves Dr. Dodd’s need to win reappointment annually to the Flom professorship. In at least two years, while senior college officials voiced concerns that she did not meet the “high standards” for “research production” and was “taking forever” to produce books and articles, she kept her position by appealing successfully to Dr. Coico, then the president, according to the complaint. By early 2017, after Dr. Boudreau had become interim president, the complaint said, Dr. Dodd believed that she had met the criteria for tenure, two years earlier than scheduled, citing a book contract with Cambridge University Press and other works. But her political science department voted against her in October. Dr. Dodd then notified CUNY that she would sue. Given the importance of the Skadden program, several people affiliated with City College, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the litigation, said that Dr. Dodd may not have lived up to expectations. Others suggested that the college had legitimate concerns, and cautioned that her case may be more complicated than the complaint suggests. Rogers M. Smith, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is the president-elect of the American Political Science Association, said that he took seriously the issue of productivity. But Dr. Smith, who tried unsuccessfully to recruit Dr. Dodd to Yale for graduate school when he taught there in the 1990s, said that he didn’t think there was an issue with her productivity, given her medical issues and the fact that she had taken parental leave. “I think very highly of her as a scholar, and I would need to be persuaded that those concerns have legitimacy,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Disappearing Acts: A Shelf of Missing-Person Mysteries,"Crime Will corporations never learn that sending their executives on wilderness retreats won’t boost their leadership skills and might even unleash “something base and elemental and almost primitive,” as Jane Harper puts it in FORCE OF NATURE (Flatiron, $25.99)? That’s what happens when five female employees of a chic little firm of accountants in Melbourne, Australia, go on a team-building hike in the rugged bush and come back one executive short. The missing soul, Alice Russell, is an argumentative bully (“Alice could start a fight in an empty room,” one colleague recalls), and her teammates must heroically resist the temptation to leave her stranded. Harper, who likes to toy with plotting, uses dual chronologies here, one in real time and the other in bush time, encouraging tensions to build until the restraints of civilization snap, giving way to bare-knuckle fights and worse. Some of this savagery can be blamed on the punishing environment, a menacing landscape of rain-soaked woodland and snake-infested underbrush, with a raging river down below. To make this hike from hell even more unnerving, a storm forces the women to take cover in a cabin with a grisly connection to a serial killer. The man is dead, but his son is still alive. This only adds to the tensions that already exist in the group, which includes squabbling twins, a secret informant and not one but two mothers whose daughters are being cyber-bullied. All of the novel’s characters have been drawn with exceptional complexity, and none more so than Aaron Falk, the federal agent investigating the case who fears that Alice’s undercover work delving into her firm’s dodgy financial practices may have been discovered. So much more than a conventional detective, the reflective and compassionate Falk provides the book’s moral compass. He respects the forces of nature and heeds the messages his father jotted down on his hiking maps: “Not safe in winter. Take care. … Tread carefully. Danger here.” ♦ Nasty, vicious, ruthless. That’s the way we like our legal mysteries, so THE PLEA (Flatiron, $26.99) fits the bill. Steve Cavanagh’s hero, Eddie Flynn, has taken to the profession with the same relish he showed for his previous work as a con man. A New York defense attorney with the dregs of the earth as clients, Flynn is living out of his office when a C.I.A. operative arrives with an offer he can’t refuse: Lean on a client to plead guilty and cut a deal, a move for which Flynn will collect a fee of $100,000. The problem is, Flynn doesn’t believe his client, David Child, is guilty of murdering his girlfriend. Could someone be framing him in order to steal his design for a security system that can be misused for laundering dirty money? The impressive legal maneuvering pays off in a centerpiece courtroom drama that Flynn describes as “Vegas time.” But a lot of his showmanship is pure flimflam, meant to dazzle his audience. After all, as Robert Frost once said, “A jury consists of 12 persons chosen to decide who has the best lawyer.” ♦ The marshland setting of Christobel Kent’s psychological thriller THE DAY SHE DISAPPEARED (Sarah Crichton/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27) holds a “particular magic” for an old man named Victor, who appreciates the desolate beauty of this bleak spot “where the sea turned into a river.” Victor’s less enchanted neighbors are more likely to turn their backs on the view and crowd into a pub like the Bird in Hand, where the mood is cheery and the barmaids, Nat and Beth, are pretty and friendly. But when Beth fails to show up for work, Nat is the only one who cares enough to look for her. Kent doesn’t play games with the whodunit plotting, and the novel’s water imagery is properly eerie. But her higher aim is to expose the blunt social prejudice against attractive young women like Nat and Beth. “Good riddance, I say,” one old biddy curses the missing barmaid. “They need to learn, women like that,” she adds. With neighbors like this, who needs a serial killer? ♦ When people speak of Albany, they usually mention the daunting weather. And there’s a lot of weather in Robin Oliveira’s WINTER SISTERS (Viking, $27). This stunning mystery is set back in 1879, when New York’s capital city is hit by a blizzard that buries the parents of 10-year-old Emma and 7-year-old Claire and hurls the girls into the streets. Dr. Mary Stipp, who ministers to prostitutes, makes it her mission to find the missing girls. But evil men get to them first, and it takes another violent act of nature — a raging flood — to flush them out of their basement prison. Rescuing Emma from rapists is even more of a challenge because the age of consent in this not-so-enlightened era is 10. Oliveira writes with feeling about social issues like abortion and prostitution, and her grasp of causes like women’s suffrage is firm. Like many others, Dr. Stipp has found that the freedoms she enjoyed during the Civil War quickly vanished in its aftermath. “Therein lay the advantage of wartime,” she notes. “Men were too busy killing one another to take heed of women’s activities.”",The New York Times
2018,Discovering Art in and Around Maastricht,"AMSTERDAM — If you look at a map of Europe and imagine the Netherlands as a man’s smiling face gazing out toward the North Sea, the city of Maastricht would be, perhaps, a crumb stuck in the man’s scraggly beard. Brush it off in a westerly direction, and it’ll drop in Belgium. If the wind blows it to the east, it will likely arrive in Germany. There are lots of regulars and exhibitors to the annual Tefaf art fair in Maastricht who visit this lovely little city built on Roman ruins and gripe about the local offerings — the hotels aren’t terribly modern, it’s too remote from top European cities, the airports aren’t sufficiently near. But if you think of Maastricht as the nub of what is known as the Meuse-Rhine Euregion — which includes parts of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany; four official languages; five provinces; 10 cities; and 3.9 million inhabitants — you’ll start off with a better mind-set about the place. “From an outside perspective, even just coming from Amsterdam, the world kind of ends in Eindhoven,” said Marie-Claire Krell, a Maastricht-based artist. “But Aachen, Liège, Brussels are so much closer to here; even Cologne is just an hour away. We are sort of the center of the periphery.” Ms. Krell is also a project manager with Very Contemporary, a network of about a dozen art venues in the Euregion that has worked to “create a shared feeling of a common crossover culture” and offers bus tours and a map of all the art locations within a 45-minute drive from Maastricht. She said that there are plenty of art-related events for someone who craves a steady dose of culture. “It’s just exactly enough because there’s something you can do every day,” she said. During the Tefaf fair (March 8-18 this year) the local institutions are particularly active. Larger institutions, such as the Bonnefantenmuseum on the eastern bank of the Meuse River in Maastricht and the Ludwig Forum about 30 minutes away in Aachen, Germany, organize exhibitions, talks and other events to coincide with Tefaf. A tour of Maastricht’s art spots might start at the center of the periphery and work its way out to the circumference. The radial axis might begin within easy strolling distance from the MECC (where Tefaf takes place), at the Bonnefantenmuseum, with its signature building that seems to have a rocket ship at its center. Designed by the Italian architect Aldo Rossi, the museum is built in the heart of the former ceramics district and contains a vast collection of Dutch and Flemish old masters, but recent programming has enlivened the older work by presenting it “in dialogue” with contemporary art — often new commissions. While the permanent galleries have a particular focus on Early Italian and Netherlandish painting and 14th- to 16th-century medieval sculpture, during Tefaf, it hosts three semi-solo exhibitions called “Beating around the bush Episode #5: Old masters never die. Starring Edward Lipski, Johan Tahon, Helen Verhoeven,” the three artists on view. Also within the city of Maastricht, the Van Eyck Academy, a postgraduate institute that provides residencies for artists, designers, architects and curators, hosts Open Studio days for art lovers on March 9 and 10 (also by invitation on March 8), allowing visitors to glimpse projects the residents are busy with in the labs, gardens and gallery spaces. One of the more exciting new art locations in the region is SCHUNCK*, a multidisciplinary cultural center and architectural institute with a museum and collection of Dutch art, situated in a glass tower (the Glaspaleis) in Heerlen, about a 35-minute drive east of Maastricht. Until June 10, it’s exhibiting the “False Memory Archive,” an installation by the artist A.R. Hopwood, who has collaborated with Maastricht University to present art and a unique collection of lively personal memories that never took place, like a set of digitally manipulated photographs of U.F.O. sightings. SCHUNCK* is simultaneously presenting “Punk+Dans+Kunst: Angry movements,” an exhibition that takes as its starting point the 1986 punk ballet film “Hail the New Puritan,” a fictionalized documentary about Scottish dancer Michael Clark, directed by Charles Atlas. Karin Post, a guest curator and choreographer, creates a contemporary collage of responses to the movie, with images, sound and dance, until May 13. About 30 minutes northeast of Maastricht, in Sittard, another one of the more recent additions to the local scene, De Domijnen Museum, is also a mixed-use arts center with a library, cinema and contemporary art museum founded in 2015. It is known for its progressive exhibitions that explore realms of art and nature. Until April 1, true to form, it delivers “The Dutch Savannah: An exhibition about water, energy and the infrastructure of the cloud.” With contemporary art by the Irish artist Yuri Pattison and others, as well as lectures and research projects, the show reflects on the Netherlands role as one of the world’s largest global hubs for digital data traffic. Slightly farther afield is the more established Ludwig Forum für Internationale Kunst, in Aachen, one of the 26 international art institutions founded by the Germany private collectors Peter and Irene Ludwig (also of the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum and Couven Museum in Aachen and the Ludwig Museum in Cologne;), which includes works of American Pop Art, Photo Realism and European postwar art. Along with a continuing exhibition of local design products, the Ludwig Forum presents (until April 15) the exhibition “Digital Games: Art and Computer Games,” exploring the evolution of artistic modes of play and interactive art games that have been part of screen culture since the mid-1990s. The European Fine Art Foundation, which runs the annual Tefaf art fair in Maastricht, has in recent years been debating the idea of relocating to a larger city, such as Amsterdam or Rotterdam, but the board of trustees in December announced that it would instead make an official 10-year commitment to Maastricht. An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Heerlen in the Netherlands. It is east of Maastricht, not northwest.",The New York Times
2018,Discussion Questions for ‘Exit West’,"Now Read This Mohsin Hamid’s novel “Exit West,” which follows two lovers on the move from a country on the brink of civil war, is our March pick for the new PBS NewsHour-New York Times book club, “Now Read This.” Become a member of the book club by joining our Facebook group, or by signing up to our newsletter. Learn more about the book club here. Below are questions to help guide discussions as you read the book throughout the month. The questions are broken down by week, or divided into four parts to match your reading speed. (Spoiler alert on the questions that are further down if you read ahead!) Week One 1. “Exit West” begins with two people meeting in a city “swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war” — setting the scene for what’s to come. Throughout the book, as the city descends into war, Hamid never mentions the place’s name. Why? 2. As the book follows its two main characters, Nadia and Saeed, readers also meet a thief in Australia, a suited man targeting women in Tokyo and an old man whose house is being surrounded by military men in San Diego, among others. We never meet these characters again. What do you think is the purpose of these interludes? 3. We learn early on that Nadia wears flowing black robes but is not religious. She says she does it so that men won’t disturb her. When she goes to withdraw money from a bank, she is groped in a crowd with “incredible force.” What are we supposed to take away from the scenes about the ways women have to survive in a period of instability? 4. Even as the city descends into war, and events become increasingly scary, Hamid rarely tells us that the characters feel fear. Instead, the reader is left to decipher how the people in the book must be feeling. Why do you think that is? Week Two 5. Hamid describes windows in people’s houses as a “border through which death was possibly most likely to come,” and the many ways a house has to be rearranged during war to ensure it’s safe. How is the feeling of home as a secure place challenged in this book? 6. After discussing the windows, Hamid introduces the rumors about doors “that could take you elsewhere.” What do we learn about the dangers and promises of these passageways? 7. The militants who take over the city do not allow music, do no not approve of unmarried lovers like Nadia and Saeed, and come looking to kill people of a particular sect. Does this book feel representative of the unrest of our present time, of our past, or both? 8. When Nadia and Saeed learn that the magical doors do exist, and can in fact take them away from the violence of their city, they are excited and immediately pursue an agent to help them leave. Saeed’s father, on the other hand, only says of the doors: “Let us see.” Does this feel resonant to you of the experience of different generations of migrants? Week Three 9. Chapter Five ends with Nadia making Saeed’s father a promise to take care of his son, and the line: “That is the way of things, for when we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind.” Is Hamid referring to Saeed’s father and the people we leave behind, or something more? 10. As migrants move through the magical doors to other places, trying to escape war and chaos, the passage they take is described as: “both like dying and like being born.” Does this description feel representative of the experience of people who migrate today? 11. We never hear, though, about what actually happens as people migrate through these doors. Why do you think the migration itself is absent from the narrative? 12. As Nadia and Saeed escape through the doors, we learn that not just their city, but much of the wider world, is in turmoil. Refugees are on the move to Mykonos in Greece and Marin County, near San Francisco. Riots are starting over migrants in Vienna and in London. What do you think Hamid wants us to understand about this global instability? 13. As these cities become more unstable, they also come under greater surveillance, at the hands of unseen authorities. These authorities also control the electricity network and internet connectivity. How do these changes impact the people in the book? How does it feel relevant to today’s world? Week Four 14. In the cities to which migrants flee, Hamid writes that people began to reassemble with others of their own kind, “like superficially with like.” At one point, even Saeed wants him and Nadia to relocate to live with others like them, though Nadia resists. What do you think is behind this human impulse? 15. As Nadia and Saeed continue to move locations, their relationship becomes increasingly unstable, and the way they speak to each other not as kind. By the end of the book, Hamid writes that they begin “slipping away” from each other, as people all over the world are “slipping away from where they had been.” What does Hamid want us to learn here? 16. And yet at the same time in Amsterdam, two older men fall in love. What do you take away from his interlude? 17. The book ends in the city of Nadia and Saeed’s birth, which Hamid writes seems to them both familiar and unfamiliar. How did you feel about this book’s ending?",The New York Times
2018,Disney Reorganization Anticipates 21st Century Fox Assets,"The Walt Disney Company unveiled a sweeping reorganization on Wednesday, promoting a pair of executives and preparing the entertainment conglomerate for the eventual integration of assets from 21st Century Fox. Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, did not mention Disney’s pending $52.4 billion acquisition of various Fox businesses, which still must receive government approval, in Wednesday’s announcement. Instead, he described the new structure as “strategically positioning our businesses for the future.” Kevin Mayer, who has recently served as chief strategy officer, working on the purchases of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and BamTech, a streaming-focused company, was named chairman of a new Disney division: Direct-to-Consumer and International. The unit will be made up of Disney’s overseas media businesses; global advertising sales for ESPN, ABC and other channels; syndicated television sales; and — most important — a portfolio of subscription streaming services. Those services, designed to make Disney competitive with the likes of Netflix and Amazon, include ESPN Plus, which will be rolled out this spring. A second and still unnamed offering, built around the Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar brands, is expected late next year. Rounding out Disney’s streaming portfolio will be Hulu, an established service that focuses on older viewers with programming that includes ABC shows. Disney also promoted Robert Chapek, who has been chairman of Disney’s theme park division for the last three years. Mr. Chapek was named chairman of a new division called Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products, which adds merchandising, video games, book publishing and the Disney Store chain to his purview. Mr. Chapek was in charge of consumer products for Disney before he was promoted to theme park chairman in 2015. The reorganization, which involves significant changes for every part of Disney except for the movie division, sets up a structure for Disney to absorb the Fox businesses. They include the Fox movie and television studio, a large portion of Hulu, 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports, the FX and National Geographic channels, and stakes in two behemoth overseas TV service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. The elevation of Mr. Mayer and Mr. Chapek was instantly read by some people in Hollywood as positioning either as a possible successor to Mr. Iger. Disney insiders cautioned against drawing that conclusion, however. To complete the Fox integration, Mr. Iger, 67, agreed to renew his contract for a fourth time, delaying retirement from July 2019 to the end of 2021. Rupert Murdoch, who controls 21st Century Fox, asked Mr. Iger to stay as a condition of the deal, which was valued at $66.1 billion including debt. As part of the restructuring, Andy Bird, the longtime chairman of Walt Disney International, is expected to leave the company. The management shuffling was announced a week after Disney named James Pitaro as president of ESPN. Mr. Pitaro previously oversaw consumer products. An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive. He is 67, not 66.",The New York Times
2018,Divers Risk Drowning and Sharks to Poach Abalone Worth $200 a Pound,"HANGBERG, South Africa — One man vanished diving at midnight. Another was attacked by a great white shark in deep water. Two more drowned, one in borrowed scuba gear he wasn’t qualified to use. All four men, who died over the past few months, were casualties of an entrenched illicit trade: poaching abalone, a seafood delicacy that sells for enormous prices in Asia. The shellfish, which once smothered reefs in South Africa, in some places packed as tightly as cobblestones, has become more difficult to find as a result of overfishing, luring untrained divers into deeper and more deadly waters. “The old reefs have been hit too hard and haven’t had time to recover,” said a diver from Hangberg, an impoverished fishing community in Cape Town, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to alert the police to his poaching. With stocks of the shellfish declining in South Africa, legal quotas on harvesting it are strictly enforced. But in Hangberg, hundreds of families have turned to the abalone black market for income, as factory closings and the demise of commercial fishing have contributed to a spike in unemployment in recent years. Fueling the demand for exports of the mollusk is China’s rising middle class, increasingly eager to consume high-status foods. For more than 2,000 years, abalone has been served to celebrate special occasions and honor guests, taking a pride of place alongside other luxury ingredients like shark fin and sea cucumber. It has a rich, buttery flavor, and, when prepared correctly, the flesh is tender, though it can be rubbery and tough. One of the world’s most expensive abalone species, Haliotis midae, occurs only on the southern and western shores of South Africa, where its high value, set amid sweeping poverty, has fueled a poaching epidemic since the end of apartheid in the early 1990s. When abalone was more plentiful closer to shore, the greatest threat to poachers was arrest, and the authorities continue to patrol the remaining patches where the mollusk can still be found. Despite the prospect of fines and prison terms, poachers are driven by a strong economic incentive because abalone fetches high prices. As a result, abalone smuggling has become an important part of the underground economy in many fishing communities. While first-time offenders may face fines as low as $10, the penalties for kingpins can rise to $10,000, with prison sentences exceeding 15 years. But for most poachers, jail terms are seldom longer than a year, and convictions are rare in South Africa’s overburdened court system. Over the years, the diver from Hangberg said, he has upgraded his house with the money earned from poaching, adding extra rooms and a watertight metal roof, and it stands apart from the lopsided shanties of his neighbors. But now resource depletion is changing the risk calculus, with divers forced to try to find abalone in turbulent waters and areas known to be frequented by sharks, making death a bigger part of the poaching equation. “Abalone have been harvested heavily in kelp beds, so now poachers try rougher areas or deeper and more exposed places,” said Serge Raemaekers, a researcher from the University of Cape Town, who has studied the abalone trade. One community, about 100 miles east of Cape Town, has been hit especially hard as divers venture into some of the most dangerous waters in the world. In a desolate informal settlement near the town of Gansbaai, divers with no historical connection to the fishing industry have taken to swimming nearly two miles out to Dyer Island, a global hot spot for shark cage diving, to hunt in comparatively untouched abalone beds. Last September, one diver, Sivuyile Xelela, was dragged to his death by a great white shark in front of other poachers. Despite the risk of such violent death, poaching has become an important source of revenue here. “Before, when we were working on the farms here, we were hungry,” said Thami, a diver from the community, who insisted on using only his first name because he feared prosecution for poaching. Formal employment is hard to find in the township, a clutch of small government homes and metal shacks at the end of a dirt track, and many men have begun diving for abalone, residents said. “The work is very dangerous, but the men do it for the money,” said a local priest, Jonathan Xama. “In church we pray for their safety. This is not a good job for anybody, and we also pray that they find something better.” Within a month of the September shark attack, two more local divers, Bradley Fick and Waylon Love, had drowned, one at Dyer Island and one in the nearby fishing community of Hawston. Both had recently begun using scuba equipment without proper training, friends and family said, in order to access abalone on deeper reefs. In February, Raeburn Jansson died trying to poach abalone in the waters off Cape Town. His widow told local news media that he was trying to earn money to fend off the threat of the couple’s four children being taken by social services. Divers at the start of the poaching supply chain say they earn around $15 a pound of shucked meat. A decent harvest of 35 pounds can bring $525, almost double South Africa’s monthly minimum wage, $295. When abalone was more abundant, it was common for divers to harvest 150 pounds or more on a single diving trip. For commercial divers working for legal abalone fisheries, the work is done under safer conditions, for less pay. Once harvested, the shellfish enters a network of buyers and middlemen, and is predominantly shipped to Hong Kong, where dried South African abalone is worth over $200 a pound, meaning large profits for those further up the supply chain. According to Markus Burgener, a senior program officer with Traffic, a nonprofit organization that monitors wildlife smuggling, poachers have stripped more than 40,000 tons of abalone from South African waters since 2000. Some 3,500 tons were poached in 2016, Mr. Burgener said, more than 30 times the entire legal catch. “Poaching has been steadily increasing,” he said. Quotas for the legal abalone fishery have been slashed by nearly 85 percent since the mid-1990s, with three formerly productive zones closed entirely to fishing. “Illegal harvesting will eventually lead to commercial extinction, where the fishery ceases to be viable at all,” said Peter J. Britz, a marine biologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa. Yet, the syndicates controlling the poaching have shown little interest in sustainability: They are Chinese criminal groups who source abalone from local street gangs, often in exchange for drugs like methamphetamine, according to police officials and a report from the Institute for Security Studies. In Cape Town, on a recent hot afternoon in South Africa’s summer, four poachers from Hangberg scrambled down some granite boulders near Clifton, a beach crowded with vacationers. The men, who were carrying a cooler to disguise their catch as a picnic, were gambling on finding undisturbed abalone beds in a highly visible area. Three of them pulled on tattered wet suits as the fourth kept watch; a few minutes later, they splashed into the frigid water with snorkels and began hunting for “perlemoen,” the Afrikaans term for abalone, derived from “mother-of-pearl,” for the shell’s inner sheen. In the kelp beds they descended to peer into rocky cracks, jabbing flat metal levers to dislodge the small creatures they found. Yet the abalone was scarce, and they got only enough to earn around $120 each — barely worth the risk, they said. Too many divers, they said, had been there already. Next time, they would have to go farther out.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Diversity in Children’s Books,"Letter To the Editor: Re “She Wants More Than M.L.K. at Bedtime” (Sunday Review, March 11): As a psychologist, I know that the books Denene Millner calls for — portraying black children in ordinary childhood situations instead of only as victims or heroes — are desperately needed for white children, too! Children living in white neighborhoods need to learn early that children with different skin colors, just like those with different hair colors, are not essentially different. Research shows that consistent early exposure helps children to experience minorities as us, not them. As a white grandmother, I have been searching for such books, and I have been saddened to see that there are far too few. MARGARET L. WHITEUPPER MONTCLAIR, N.J.",The New York Times
2018,Do Antidepressants Work? ,"The New Health Care The most comprehensive study on them has recently been published, showing mostly modest effects. More people in the United States are on antidepressants, as a percentage of the population, than any other country in the world. And yet the drugs’ efficacy has been hotly debated. Some believe that the short-term benefits are much more modest than widely thought, and that harms may outweigh benefits in the long run. Others believe that they work, and that they can be life-changing. Settling this debate has been much harder than you might think. It’s not that we lack research. Many, many studies of antidepressants can be found in the peer-reviewed literature. The problem is that this has been a prime example of publication bias: Positive studies are likely to be released, with negative ones more likely to be buried in a drawer. In 2008, a group of researchers made this point by doing a meta-analysis of antidepressant trials that were registered with the Food and Drug Administration as evidence in support of approvals for marketing or changes in labeling. Companies had to submit the results of registered trials to the F.D.A. regardless of the result. These trials also tend to have less data massaging — such as the cherry-picking of outcomes — than might be possible in journals. The researchers found 74 studies, with more than 12,500 patients, for drugs approved between 1987 and 2004. About half of these trials had “positive” results, in that the antidepressant performed better than a placebo; the other half were “negative.” But if you looked only in the published literature, you’d get a much different picture. Nearly all of the positive studies are there. Only three of the negative studies appear in the literature as negative. Twenty-two were never published, and 11 were published but repackaged so that they appeared positive. A second meta-analysis published that year also used F.D.A. data instead of the peer-reviewed literature, but asked a different question. Researchers wondered if the effectiveness of a study was related to the baseline levels of depression of its participants. The results suggested yes. The effectiveness of antidepressants was limited for those with moderate depression, and small for those with severe depression. The take-home message from these two studies was that the effectiveness of antidepressants had been overstated, and that the benefit might be limited to far fewer patients than were actually using the drugs. These points, and more, were made in a paper written by John Ioannidis in the journal Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine in 2008. He argued that the study designs and populations selected, especially the short length of many studies, biased them to positive results. He argued that while many studies achieved statistical significance, they failed to achieve clinical significance. He argued that we knew too little about long-term harms, and that we were being presented with biased information by looking only at published data. This paper — “Effectiveness of Antidepressants: An Evidence Myth Constructed From a Thousand Randomized Trials?” — sowed lingering doubts about the use of antidepressants and the conduct of medical research. But recently, the most comprehensive antidepressants study to date was published, and it appears to be a thorough effort to overcome the hurdles of the past. Researchers, including Dr. Ioannidis this time, searched the medical literature, regulatory agency websites and international registers for both published and unpublished double-blind randomized controlled trials, all the way till the beginning of 2016. They looked for both placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used to treat adults for major depressive disorder. They used a “network meta-analysis technique,” which allows multiple treatments to be compared both within individual trials directly and across trials indirectly to a common comparator. They examined not only how well the drugs worked, but also how tolerated the treatment was — what they called acceptability. They found 522 trials that included more than 116,000 participants. Of those, 86 were unpublished studies found on trial registries and company websites. An additional 15 were discovered through personal communication or by hand-searching review articles. The authors went an extra step and asked for unpublished data on the studies they found, getting it for more than half of the included trials. The reassuring news is that all of the antidepressants were more effective than placebos. They varied modestly in terms of efficacy and acceptability, so each patient and doctor should discuss potential benefits and harms of individual drugs. Further good news is that smaller trials did not have substantially different results from larger trials. It also did not appear that industry sponsoring of trials correlated with significant differences in response or dropout rates. But — and this is a big “but” — the vast majority of trials are funded by industry. As a result, this meta-analysis may not have had enough data on non-industry trials to accurately determine if a difference exists. There were also signs of “novelty” bias: Antidepressants seemed to perform better when they were newly released in the market but seemed to lose efficacy and acceptability in later years. The bad news is that even though there were statistically significant differences, the effect sizes were still mostly modest. The benefits also applied only to people who were suffering from major depression, specifically in the short term. In other words, this study provides evidence that when people are found to have acute major depression, treatment with antidepressants works to improve outcomes in the first two months of therapy. Because we lack good data, we still do not know how well antidepressants work for those with milder symptoms that fall short of major depression, especially if patients have been on the drugs for months or even years. Many people probably fall into that category, yet are still regularly prescribed antidepressants for extended periods. We don’t know how much of the benefit received from such use is a placebo effect versus a biological one. I asked Dr. Ioannidis if the results of this new study were as radical as many news articles had suggested. He confirmed that this was a much-larger meta-analysis — with about 10 times more information — than the ones from a decade ago, with more unpublished data and more antidepressants covered. He’s also hopeful that future studies will be even better at informing individual-level responses, which might help to see if some patients benefit substantially even when others don’t seem to benefit at all. But he thought that some of the exuberance in the news media might be a little overblown. “I am afraid that some news stories gave very crude interpretations that may be misleading, especially when their titles were too absolute, like ‘the drugs work’, ‘the debate is over’ and so forth,” he said. “The clinical (as opposed to statistical) significance of the treatment effects that we detected will continue to be contested, and it is still important to find ways that one can identify the specific patients who get the maximum benefit.” Even with so much research on antidepressants, there are still many unanswered questions. It’s unclear if drug companies would be interested in the results, or indeed why they would be. The drugs are already being widely used, and no regulatory agency is requiring more data. If patients want answers, they will need to demand the research themselves.",The New York Times
2018,Do Face Masks Really Keep You Healthy?,"Ask Well Q. How effective are antimicrobial “courtesy masks” at preventing the spread of contagious airborne illnesses? A. The best evidence suggests that, when sick, wearing a mask can help to protect others from getting sick. And when well, wearing a mask around those who are sick will probably decrease your own chances of becoming infected. But the masks are far from foolproof. Courtesy masks, or what we doctors refer to as surgical masks, were introduced into the operating room in the late 1800s. They quickly became popular among a public eager to protect itself against the influenza pandemic of 1918. A century later, the advent of modern molecular techniques confirmed that surgical masks can indeed provide good protection against flu. In a 2013 study, researchers counted the number of virus particles in the air around patients with flu. They found that surgical masks decreased the exhalation of large viral droplets 25-fold. The masks were, however, less effective against the fine viral droplets that can remain suspended in the air longer and are therefore more infectious, cutting them by 2.8 times. Surgical masks also afford fairly good protection for the worried well. In an oft-cited study of 446 nurses, researchers found surgical masks were as good, or nearly as good, at protecting the wearer against flu as respirators, a somewhat more high-tech, masklike device used in hospitals. The work of Australian investigators provides further support for the value of the simple surgical mask. They estimate that in a home setting, wearing a surgical mask decreases a well person’s risk of getting sick by 60 percent to 80 percent. Unfortunately, most people fail to wear a mask faithfully enough to achieve this degree of protection, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remains equivocal about the use of masks outside of health care settings. “No recommendation can be made at this time for mask use in the community by asymptomatic persons, including those at high risk for complications, to prevent exposure to influenza viruses,” the agency concludes on its website. If you don’t have a mask, or don’t want to wear one, standing at least six feet from an infected person will increase your chances for staying healthy. The air surrounding sick people, even if they aren’t coughing or sneezing, is loaded with small infectious aerosolized particles, and the farther you are from them, the better. Washing your hands frequently, of course, is also critical for staying healthy, since touching infected fingers to the eyes, nose or mouth can transmit infection. Do you have a health question?

2018,Do Financial Advisers Have to Act in Your Interest? Maybe,"Scottrade. Ameriprise. Wells Fargo. Within the last month, two of these financial-service providers were accused of deceiving retirement account customers, while Wells Fargo revealed that it was the subject of an investigation exploring whether it made questionable recommendations to 401(k) customers, among other things. It isn’t easy for consumers to figure out what kind of professional they can trust with their money, especially when any annuity salesperson with a business card can masquerade as a bona fide financial adviser. For a while, it seemed like a new consumer protection that took partial effect last June would provide some clarity: It requires financial professionals, including brokers and insurance agents, to act in their customers’ best interests when handling their retirement money. The goal of the rule, which was implemented by the Obama administration despite strong opposition from the financial services industry, was to make it easier for retirement savers to trust that their financial advisers were looking out for them — and not profiting at their expense. Before the rule, brokers only had to ensure that their recommendations were suitable, which is a lower standard. But the future of the rule remains uncertain and is likely to become even more contested in the months ahead. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that the Labor Department, which oversees retirement accounts and created the so-called fiduciary rule, overstepped its authority and struck it down. [READ MORE: To Find the Right Financial Adviser, ‘Do a Beauty Contest’] The rule still has a chance to live on, legal experts say, but its fate depends on the Trump administration’s next steps and what may unfold in the courts. The future of the rule was already called into question last year when the new leadership at the Labor Department said it would review the regulation and delayed its full implementation by 18 months to July 2019. After this month’s court ruling, the agency said that pending further review, it would not enforce the rule. But there is another complication. The Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly working on its own proposal for financial professionals, which would likely apply to all investment accounts and not just tax-advantaged retirement money. In October, Jay Clayton, the S.E.C. chairman, said that he was “focused on the standards of conduct that investment professionals must follow in providing advice to Main Street investors.” Last June, he invited the public to submit comments on the issue. (The S.E.C. declined to comment on the details of any future proposal.) Regardless of whether any form of the fiduciary rule survives, however, consumers need to proceed with caution. “Given the uncertainty, there is more reason now than ever for an investor to simply ask a financial adviser whether he or she is acting as a fiduciary, at all times,” said Arthur Laby, a professor at Rutgers Law School. Fiduciary is the legal term that means an adviser must put its customers’ financial well-being before their own. One ally for consumers in lieu of the federal government could be the states. Champions of the Labor Department’s fiduciary rule, include William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth, who recently called on the federal government to appeal the court decision striking down the rule. In the meantime, he said his office would continue to aggressively pursue investigations to ensure retirees were protected. Just last month, he brought charges against Scottrade, now part of TD Ameritrade. “If the Department of Labor will not enforce its own laws and rules, then the states must do what they can to protect retirees,” he said at the time. In anticipation of the fiduciary rule, Scottrade banned a list of activities that could tempt its representatives to put their own financial interests ahead of customers, including sales quotas and contests, bonuses and special awards. But Scottrade held two sales contests anyway, according to the Massachusetts regulator’s complaint. Both contests “perversely incentivized Scottrade agents to bring in new assets from customers, including through the rollover of retirement assets,” the complaint said. It also noted that “Scottrade’s own internal-use materials instructed agents to target a client’s ‘pain point’ and emotional vulnerability.” Ultimately, Secretary Galvin’s office charged the firm with engaging in unethical and dishonest conduct. TD Ameritrade declined to comment on the matter. Ameriprise Financial recently settled allegations that the firm’s representatives recommended and sold higher-priced mutual fund shares to retirement account holders, which made the brokers more money, when cheaper shares were available. About 1,791 customers’ accounts paid nearly $1.8 million in unnecessary upfront sales charges, as well as higher ongoing fees and expenses, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ameriprise did not admit or deny the findings, but as part of a settlement with regulators it paid back customers (with interest) as well as a $230,000 penalty. Regardless of how the fiduciary saga ends, there are several things consumers can do to minimize that they will be on the receiving end of any of these shenanigans. • Work with a fiduciary, or someone who pledges to put your financial interests ahead of their own — all of the time, with all of your money. Get them to pledge to their fiduciary duty in writing. Working with a fiduciary is not fail-safe, but it is a consumer’s best defense. So-called investment advisers, who generally must register with the S.E.C. or a state securities regulator, must put their customers’ interests first, regardless of what accounts they are working with. • Choose a financial planner with strong credentials. Anyone can call themselves a financial adviser, at least for now, so don’t accept titles at face value. Certified financial planners hold a professional designation with rigorous curriculum and experience requirements. They can manage your entire financial life, but can also provide guidance locating reputable specialists, like an estate planner, or, say, a life insurer who will sell you only what you need. • Consider paying the adviser outright. No financial adviser is entirely free of conflicts. But it’s often easier to eliminate those conflicts when they are paid for their time or advice and their paychecks are not dependent on selling you a financial product. • You can find a list of fee-only financial planners through the Garrett Planning Network, the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and the XY Planning Network. Apply the same sort of rigor in your search for a financial adviser as you would when seeking a doctor or a lawyer, advised Tamar Frankel, a fiduciary expert and professor at Boston University School of Law. “The rules do not do it now,” she said. “So you have to do it now.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Do Not Read This Editorial While Walking,"Editorial Notebook Should you be reading this on some electronic device while crossing the street, please stop. Right now. Traffic may be swirling around you. Your inattentiveness puts you in harm’s way. And if by chance you’re in Montclair, Calif., while reading this and crossing the street, you’d best keep an eye out not only for cars but also for the police. You’re breaking the law. Officials in Montclair, in Southern California, decided that their 39,000 residents needed a heads-up — literally. There were accidents that resulted in part from pedestrians burying their noses in smartphones with their minds miles away. Something had to be done about these “cellphone zombies,” Edward Starr, the city manager, said. So Montclair made it illegal to cross streets while on a phone, texting or listening to music with buds in both ears. Fines of $100, and as much as $500 for repeat offenses, will go into effect in August. Other places have had the same idea. Honolulu enacted a comparable law months ago. Rexburg, Idaho, a town about the same size as Montclair, adopted a similar ban in 2011 after the shock of having five pedestrians die. It hasn’t had a single pedestrian fatality since. Legislation along the same lines has been contemplated in several states and major cities. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday that he, too, was open to the idea. Maybe it’s time for every municipality to get serious about distracted walking, as it’s called, even though distracted driving is plainly a bigger concern. This is the belief theologically held by many motorists that they can read email, text friends, call the office and all the while stay fully focused on the road. They’re delusional. They’re also dangerous. It is perhaps not a shock that in this age of cellphone zombies, traffic deaths in the United States have risen, after years of steady declines thanks to safer cars and improved road design. The 2016 toll was 37,461, or 14 percent higher than that in 2014. The final tally for 2017 is expected to be no more heartening. The increase in pedestrian deaths, which account for 16 percent of all traffic fatalities, is even more discouraging. There were 5,987 of them in 2016, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Expectations are that 2017 will end up with a toll at least that high. That’s a rise of 22 percent from the 4,910 registered in 2014. No doubt, inattentive driving is to blame in large measure. But distracted walking is a likely factor, too. And maybe so is pot-smoking. Analyzing data for the first half of 2017, the Governors Highway Safety Association found a notable increase in pedestrian deaths in states that had legalized marijuana. Elsewhere, the death toll declined. It is too early for firm conclusions, but you can’t rule out that judgments are flawed when drivers and pedestrians go around stoned. Enforcing an ordinance like Montclair’s won’t be easy. You can’t put police on every corner. And as sure as a sunrise, some people will wail about personal freedoms being violated. But there’s a social contract to be observed. When you venture forth in public, you assume certain responsibilities, be it preserving your own life or having regard for others. Even in nonlethal situations, who isn’t driven crazy when blocked on the sidewalk by people ambling so s-l-o-w-l-y, with eyes glued to their screens? Mr. Starr says that people in Montclair seem to get it, including youngsters who deem smartphones a birthright. “Students are actually pretty understanding, and even tell us this was really needed,” he said of the new rules. That’s because they know their lives matter.",The New York Times

2018,Do We Worry Too Much About Germs?,"Student Opinion Germs can cause disease and infections; they can make us sick and even kill us. Even so, do we worry too much about them in our everyday lives? With our ubiquitous hand sanitizers and antibacterial soaps, have we become obsessive when it comes to microbes? In “Your Cute Rubber Duck May Be a Haven for Bacteria,” Ceylan Yeginsu writes about possible bacterial dangers lurking in the bathtub: There’s an ugly truth about the rubber duck, the popular bathroom toy that children put in their mouths and use to squeeze bath water into their siblings’ faces. Something yucky is likely to be inside, scientists say: “potentially pathogenic bacteria” that can cause eye, ear and stomach infections. A study by American and Swiss researchers found that toy ducks appeared to be a breeding ground for microbes. The murky water released from four out of every five ducks tested included Legionella along with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, often associated with infections acquired in hospitals, the authors of the study said. The study, conducted by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, ETH Zurich and the University of Illinois, was published on Tuesday in the journal N.P.J. Biofilms and Microbiomes. The researchers tested a range of bath toys, 19 different ones, and found 75 million cells of bacteria per square centimeter in the ducks — a strikingly high level that scientists say was a result of their polymer material releasing carbon, which acts as a nutrient for bacteria. “In addition to the nutrient supply, dirty bath water also serves as a further source of microbial seeding for the bath toys,” the researchers noted. They suggested that using a higher-quality polymer to make the rubber ducks might prevent bacterial and fungal growth. The study, which received funding from the Swiss government, is part of broader research into bacteria on household objects. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — How much do you worry about germs? Are you careful about what you touch or put in your mouth? Are you mindful of washing your hands frequently, especially before you eat? Do you use hand sanitizer regularly?

And a recent study reported that a dirty kitchen sponge has about 82 billion bacteria living in just a cubic inch of space.

2018,Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?,"Student Opinion Did you take part in the national school walkouts to protest gun violence on March 14? If so, why did you decide to join, and what was the experience like? If not, why did you decide to opt out? Have you ever taken part in any other kind of political activism? Do you think that in general it is good for teenagers to participate this way? Why or why not? In “National School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S.,” Alan Blinder and Julie Turkewitz write: Thousands of students, emboldened by a growing protest movement over gun violence, stood up in their classrooms on Wednesday and walked out of their schools in a nationwide demonstration, one month after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Florida. The 17-minute protests unfolding at hundreds of schools are intended to pressure Congress to approve gun control legislation after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and come 10 days before major protests in Washington and elsewhere. … The demonstrations unfolded in different ways from city to city and school to school. In some places, demonstrators chanted and held signs. At other schools, students stood in silence. In Atlanta, some students took a knee. Thousands of students around New York, many backed by permission slips from their parents, walked out of their schools and converged on central locations — Columbus Circle, Battery Park, Brooklyn Borough Hall, Lincoln Center. … In Washington, thousands left their classrooms in the city and its suburbs and marched to the Capitol steps, their high-pitched voices battling against the stiff wind: “Hey-hey, ho-ho, the N.R.A. has got to go!” One sign said: “Fix This, Before I Text My Mom from Under A Desk.” Another article published on the same day, this one from the Well section, explains “Why Demonstrating Is Good for Kids.” In it, Lisa Damour writes: Participating in political activism may be good for our teenagers, according to a new research report. The study, published in January in the journal Child Development, found that late adolescents and young adults who voted, volunteered or engaged in activism ultimately went further in school and had higher incomes than those who did not mobilize for political or social change. By tracking nearly 10,000 young people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial and economic backgrounds, researchers from Wake Forest School of Medicine, Fordham University and the University of Massachusetts measured the long-term implications of youth political and social engagement. Remarkably, they found that civic activity linked to better academic and financial outcomes regardless of early school performance and parental education levels, two factors that usually drive later success. Of course, correlation does not prove causation, but the study makes a case for the benefits of civic engagement. In light of the findings, Parissa Ballard, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor in the department of family and community medicine at Wake Forest School of Medicine, said that “having meaningful opportunities to volunteer or be involved in activism may change how young people think about themselves or their possibilities for the future.” Students: Read both articles, then tell us … — What is your reaction to the national school walkouts to protest gun violence? What comes to mind as you read about and see photos and videos from students protesting around the country? — What is your opinion of the message that students were trying to send with these walkouts? Do you think this protest will be effective in addressing the issue of gun violence in the United States? — How do you think teachers and administrators should respond to student protests, whether over this issue or any other? Do you think times like this, when large numbers of young people are reacting to an issue in the news, should be treated in school as “teachable moments”? If so, how? — In general, how do you feel about teenagers participating in political activism? Do you agree with the article above that says it may be good for you?

2018,Do You Think You Might Like Communal Living When You’re an Adult?,"Student Opinion “In search of reasonable rent, the middle-class backbone of San Francisco — maitre d’s, teachers, bookstore managers, lounge musicians, copywriters and merchandise planners — are engaging in an unusual experiment in communal living: They are moving into dorms,” The New York Times reports. Before you read the article, what is your initial reaction? Do you think you might like living this way when you’re adult — whether to save money, to meet other people, or for any other reason? In “Dorm Living for Professionals Comes to San Francisco,” Nellie Bowles writes: ImageStarcity is renovating two large buildings in San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood to turn into dorm rooms for the middle class. CreditJason Henry for The New York Times Shared bathrooms at the end of the hall and having no individual kitchen or living room is becoming less weird for some of the city’s workers thanks to Starcity, a new development company that is expressly creating dorms for many of the non-tech population. Starcity has already opened three properties with 36 units. It has nine more in development and a wait list of 8,000 people. The company is buying a dozen more buildings (including one-star hotels, parking garages, office buildings and old retail stores), has raised $18.9 million in venture capital and hired a team of 26 people. Starcity said it was on track to have hundreds of units open around the San Francisco Bay Area this year, and thousands by 2019. These are not micro-units, nor are they like WeWork’s WeLive housing developments, where residents have their own small kitchens, living rooms and bathrooms but share common event space and industrial appliances for parties. These are not single-family homes that are being used as group houses. Instead, Starcity residents get a bedroom of 130 square feet to 220 square feet. Many of the buildings will feature some units with a private bath for a higher rent. But Jon Dishotsky, Starcity’s co-founder and chief executive, said a ratio of one bathroom for every two to three bedrooms makes the most sense for large-scale affordability. The average one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco rents for $3,300 a month, but Starcity rooms go for $1,400 to $2,400 a month fully furnished, with utilities and Wi-Fi included. “If you think about the most private things that you do, a lot of them are related to the bathroom,” said Mr. Dishotsky, 34. “So that’s probably the hardest part.” Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — What do you think of the Starcity living arrangements, and why?

2018,Doctored Photo Prompts a Keeper of the Pope’s Image to Step Down,"ROME — Even by the Vatican’s minimal standards of transparency, doctoring the letter of a retired pope to make him seem more supportive of his successor turns out to be a bit much. Pope Francis on Wednesday accepted the resignation of Msgr. Dario Vigano, the head of the Vatican’s communications department, after an episode of airbrushing and selective editing had prompted cries of “Lettergate” and accusations that the Vatican had spread the type of fake news the pope had recently denounced. The resignation of Monsignor Vigano, a close aide to the pope, represented another setback in what has been a difficult stretch for the 81-year-old pontiff, who just completed his fifth year in office. Remarks Francis made in Chile that were offensive to victims of sexual abuse focused attention on an explosive issue that has threatened to derail his papacy. The success of anti-immigrant forces in Italian elections in March seemed a sharp rebuke in Francis’ own backyard to his message of tolerance for migrants. His financial reforms have stalled, and conservatives appalled by what they consider his break with church doctrine and orthodoxy have ramped up their critiques. “It is a rather critical moment of Francis’ papacy,” said Sandro Magister, a Vatican expert at the Italian weekly L’Espresso. He said that based on the changes made by Francis “it’s hard to call him a reformist now” and that his greatest achievement had been “in terms of church image.” But it was Monsignor Vigano, who as communications director was the keeper of the pope’s image, who created the headache this time. In an apparent effort to buttress Francis against criticism from conservatives for breaking with his predecessor’s doctrinal orthodoxy, Monsignor Vigano held a news conference last week to publicize a new series of books about the pope’s theology. At the news conference, Monsignor Vigano said he had asked Francis’ predecessor, Benedict, to “write a page or a page and a half of dense theology in his clear and punctual style” and that the 90-year-old retired pope responded instead with a “beautiful, personal letter.” In the letter, Benedict condemned the “foolish prejudice” of critics who depicted Francis as a pragmatic pastor without theology and Benedict as an academic with his head in the clouds. Benedict added that the books helped clarify “the interior continuity between the two pontificates, with all the differences in style and temperament.” Monsignor Vigano and the Vatican disseminated a photo of the letter and spun it as Benedict’s seal of good papal housekeeping for Francis. The suggestion was that Benedict had read and approved of the books. But there were some key omissions. It turned out that the Vatican had purposely blurred the final two lines on the letter’s first page in which Benedict acknowledged that he had not actually read the books and that he was physically unable and too busy to contribute his own theological assessment of Pope Francis. Distorted though it was, at least the first page saw the light of day. In the photo, the letter’s second page sits buried under the books about Francis. Only Benedict’s signature was visible. Monsignor Vigano, in a sort of Keystone Clergy moment, himself drew attention to the omissions in the photo when he read the missing text at Monday’s news conference. Mr. Magister, who was at the news conference, transcribed and published the remarks. The Associated Press first drew attention to what appeared to be blurred lines in the photo of the letter. Its discovery prompted an outcry, especially among Catholic conservatives who complained that their hero, Pope Benedict, was being exploited to paper over Francis’ doctrinal deficiencies. The Twitter hashtag #releasetheletter went viral. The Catholic Herald, a Catholic publication, ran the headline “Blurred Lines: Vatican Manipulation of Photo Becomes the Story.” Under pressure to address what it called “presumed manipulation,” the Vatican on Saturday released Benedict’s full letter, of which almost the entire second page consisted of Benedict expressing his “surprise” that the 11-volume “Theology of Pope Francis” included a German author who, Benedict said, had targeted his teachings with “virulent” and “anti-papist” attacks. He said he was too busy to read the books and offer his assessment. “I’m certain you can understand why I’m declining,” Benedict signed off. The Vatican claimed it originally released only the portion of the letter it considered “opportune and relevant.” But it did not look good. Especially because Pope Francis, who frequently laments journalists who fail to report the full story, released a major document in January condemning “fake news.” In the document, he said deception in the media went back to the snake in the Garden of Eden. That was not a good ancestry for the Vatican’s communications director. “In recent days many controversies have arisen regarding my work, which beyond my intentions, has destabilized the complex and great work of reform that you entrusted to me,” Monsignor Vigano, 55, wrote in his resignation letter. Perhaps in an effort to compensate for the previous redaction, the Vatican on Wednesday released what appeared to be the full text of the letters between Monsignor Vigano and the pope, who had hired him as communications director in 2015. On Wednesday, Francis wrote back to Monsignor Vigano and said, “I respect your decision and I welcome, not without some struggle, your resignation.” The Vatican press office added that until Francis names a replacement, the communications office will be run by its second-in-command, Msgr. Lucio Ruiz. The pope asked Monsignor Vigano to stay on to advise the future director, it said. A scandal in a communications department that had been a source of the pope’s strength, Mr. Magister said, was not a good sign for Francis’ reform agenda. “This is only the umpteenth proof of the failure,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Documenting the Dynamic Black Community of 1940s Seattle,"RACE STORIES The radiant photograph shows Duke Ellington at the piano, his hands dancing across the keyboard. Behind him, a drummer lifts his arms joyously in the air. It is the type of club photo we have seen many times, often taken in famous venues like the Savoy Ballroom, Café Society or the Cotton Club. Except this one was taken in Seattle, a city known more for grunge than great jazz. The image appears in “Seattle on the Spot: The Photographs of Al Smith,” an exhibition at the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle, a city that played only a modest role in American jazz history. Mr. Smith’s photos tell a compelling story, not just about the city’s jazz scene but also about the complexity of life in an African-American community cloistered within a largely white, and for many decades, de facto segregated city. Organized by Howard Giske, the museum’s curator of photography and a friend of Mr. Smith’s, the exhibition is accompanied by a catalog with essays by Mr. Giske and the historians Jacqueline E. A. Lawson and Quin’Nita Cobbins; the jazz critic Paul de Barros; and the photographer’s son, Al Smith Jr., known as Butch. Photographing clubs in the 1940s, Mr. Smith documented a heroic period for Seattle jazz, a scene that jump-started the careers of luminaries like Quincy Jones, Ray Charles and Ernestine Anderson. Unlike other nightclubs, where patrons of color were barred except on designated nights, the integrated establishments of Jackson Street, in the city’s predominantly black Central District, embraced African-American performers and customers. Mr. Smith, who died in 2008 at the age of 92, was born to Jamaican immigrant parents and grew up in the Central District in a close-knit West Indian community. “When my father ... was given a Kodak camera as a preteen, he fell in love with photography,” noted the younger Mr. Smith. “From then on, he always had a camera. It was like a universal key that opened doors and gave him license to go anywhere.” After traveling the Pacific as a steward on steamships, Mr. Smith returned to Seattle in the 1940s, raising a family in the District. Documenting Seattle’s after-hours jazz scene, the enterprising and self-taught photographer started On the Spot, a business that sold photographs to club patrons. Through Mr. Smith’s lens, we witness an impressive range of jazz musicians performing, including Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and Lionel Hampton. After the jazz nightclub scene largely shut down in the mid-1950s, Mr. Smith, who remained a letter carrier by day, became the go-to photographer for events, celebrations, and gatherings in the African-American community. These intimate images also chronicled the broader cultural and demographic shifts of the Central District. While segregation was not legally sanctioned in Seattle, the Central District emerged in the shadow of discrimination. As black Americans migrated to the Pacific Northwest during World War II — with Seattle’s black population more than tripling to over 15,000 from 4,000 — banks, real estate agencies and neighborhood associations engaged in redlining and other discriminatory practices. “The isolation of African-Americans in the Central District,” wrote Ms. Cobbins, resulted in a “geographically concentrated black community within Seattle, where African-Americans fashioned their own cultural, social, political and economic spaces with meager resources.” Mr. Smith’s photographs bear witness to this social and cultural transformation: the beauty parlors and barber shops that were vital to the district’s business sector; the local chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, the nation’s first intercollegiate African-American fraternity; the “International Fighting Irish” youth football team, sponsored by the Japanese-American Veterans Association and open to children of all races; Mardi Gras, a weeklong summer festival evocative of its New Orleans counterpart; and the singer and pianist Hazel Scott, who refused to perform in segregated venues, playing the Civic Auditorium in 1947. The photo of Ms. Scott is a reminder that Seattle’s African-American jazz scene was not immune to racism. While the Jackson Street clubs drew renowned musicians, the mainstream press did not cover them, focusing instead on the classical music venues favored by white people. As prejudice banished a rich and flourishing music scene from the cultural mainstream, Mr. Smith faithfully documented it for posterity. His photographs tell us as much about the present as they do about the past. The once bustling and self-sufficient neighborhood he documented for more than half a century has changed dramatically. Gentrification, the decline of affordable housing, the influx of young, mostly white tech workers, and the continued legacy of racism and segregation have transformed a predominantly black neighborhood into a mostly white one: In 1970, the black population of the Central District was 73 percent. By 2014, it had dwindled to less than 20 percent. “To be black in Seattle requires an ability to hold your own in mostly white spaces,” Tyrone Beason wrote in The Seattle Times in 2016. “You have to get used to representing not just your own idiosyncrasies as a person but an entire race. It can be draining work, and it can detract from the obvious benefits of living in a region with good-paying jobs, a mix of lifestyles and otherwise easygoing people.” In this context, Mr. Smith’s documentation of Seattle’s African-American community testifies to the possibilities of the past as well as the diminished opportunities of the present. “It surprises me why there weren’t more people taking these pictures back then,” he once remarked. In light of the vanishing of a dynamic community, it is fortunate that at least one talented and devoted photographer saw fit to embrace this responsibility.

2018,Does Blended Scotch Still Have a Place in the Modern Bar?,"Spirits of The Times My parents did not drink much, but they maintained a full liquor cabinet, either out of a sense of hospitality or because they received a lot of nice gifts. Not surprisingly, the array of spirits fascinated me. I remember the red-velvet-covered bottle of cherry heering, the coffee-scented Kahlua and the herbal Dubonnet that my father liked. But what most impressed me was the Scotch, and the famous, evocative names like Cutty Sark, Dewar’s and Chivas Regal. Later on, as I started to work and came to understand that bars were an essential companion to the newspaper business, I saw how people adopted specific brands of Scotch as their own, drinking solely J & B or Ballantine’s, just as one smoked Marlboros or Salems. Personally, I preferred beer. Those names do not mean as much today, at least to those who are drawn to whisky by the flavors rather than the brand connotations. Any discussion of Scotch whisky nowadays is dominated by the single malts, which hardly existed as a category back when I was stealthily sniffing from the bottles in my parents’ cabinet. When we think of Scotch whisky today, it’s to compare, say, the smoky, complex malts of Islay with the fruity, spicy malts of the Highlands. The blended Scotches of yore seem like such an afterthought that it’s a bit of a surprise to learn that they still vastly outsell single malts, though their proportion of the Scotch market has dwindled since 1990, the first year for which statistics differentiating between single malts and blends are available. Back then, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group, blends accounted for 98 percent of the Scotch market in the United States, about 13.1 million cases against just 240,000 cases of single malts. By 2017, that proportion had dropped to 77 percent of the Scotch market, which had dwindled in total to about 9.3 million cases. During that time, sales of blends dropped to about 7.2 million cases in 2017 while sales of single malts rose to about 2.1 million, an increase of almost ninefold. Nonetheless, a lot of blended Scotch is sold in the United States, nearly twice as much as Irish whiskey, which over the last few years has been the fastest-growing spirit in the country. Largely out of curiosity, the spirits panel recently tasted through 20 bottles of blended Scotch in an effort to see what they offered. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by two drinks writers, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson. First, some definitions. All Scotch whisky must be made in Scotland. Single malts come from a single distillery and are distilled entirely from malted barley. Malting simply means soaking the barley until it germinates, which releases enzymes that convert starches to fermentable sugars. The germination is stopped by heating the barley, sometimes over peat fires, which impart a smoky aroma. Blended Scotch combines malt whisky, either a single malt or many, with grain whisky. The whiskies must be aged at least three years in oak barrels, and if a bottle carries an age statement, like “8 Years Old,” it means that the youngest whisky in the blend is that old. While the malt components are the crucial elements, the grain whisky is not just neutral spirit, like vodka. It, too, takes on character as it ages. One other important Scotch category exists, blended malt whisky, a combination of two or more single malts. These whiskies, which used to be called vatted malts, can be wonderful and complex. But they differ from blended Scotch as they do not contain any grain whisky. It’s tempting to think of blended Scotch as diluted malt whisky. There may be some truth to that, but it’s not the whole story. In his excellent guide, “The World Atlas of Whisky,” Dave Broom asserts that in good blended Scotches, grain whisky coaxes out the complexities of a malt by emphasizing secondary characteristics that might otherwise be hidden. “Malts are about intensity of character,” he writes. “Single-malt bottlings are about maximizing this singularity. Blends are about creating a totality.” Nonetheless, Mr. Broom’s book devotes just three pages to blended Scotch and more than 150 to single malts. “They don’t get a lot of celebration,” Robert said. David noted that efforts are made periodically to talk up blended Scotch, but they never really take hold, particularly among younger consumers. “Blended Scotch doesn’t have the craft imprimatur,” he said, “even though some are really good, like Pinch, if you can even find it.” Sadly, we did not have Pinch among our 20 bottles. We all found a lot to like among these blended Scotches. I was drawn to their mildness and restraint. It was easy to see how they would satisfy people who prefer whisky that is not as aggressive as many single malts. Nonetheless, we preferred the whiskies that had assertive malt characters, with creamy textures and lingering flavors. The differences among many of them were small and incremental. David said he was expecting more variation among them, and recalled that years ago blended Scotches were maltier and peatier. Robert felt that, as producers are able to blend any whiskies they want, they might have missed an opportunity to stand out from the crowd. “But they are making these whiskies for an audience,” he said, “so they are obliged to satisfy.” Our No. 1 bottle was Buchanan’s Master, which seemed to epitomize the category: smoky but not too smoky, rich and creamy but not too much so, more complete package than singular distinctiveness. No. 2 was Teacher’s Highland Cream, which had a pleasant smokiness and an attractive oily texture. At $24 for a liter, it was also our best value. Teacher’s was on the cusp of what the trade refers to as value and premium brands, the lower end of the price spectrum and the categories of Scotch that are declining the fastest. Any growth in blended Scotch, the Distilled Spirits Council said, is coming among high-end premium and especially super premium, the most expensive categories. Super premium includes brands like Johnnie Walker Blue Label, which, at $150 or so a bottle, exceeded our $100 cap. The ever-popular Johnnie Walker Black Label, however, a high-end premium brand at $55 a liter, was our No. 3 bottle. It was creamy, complex and among the smoothest of the whiskies, which may be because it was one of only three bottles in our tasting to carry an age statement, 12 years. The other 12-year-old in our top 10 was Chivas Regal at No. 6, rounded and mild with subtle aromas of malt and flowers. No. 4 was the spicy, easygoing Compass Box Asyla, which had a natural sort of sweetness that differed markedly from the sweetness that comes from the legal use of caramel as a coloring agent. We found several bottles that tasted overly of caramel. They did not make the cut. Other notable bottles included the fresh, chewy Ballantine’s Finest, the smooth and spicy White Horse, the creamy J & B Rare, the gently peaty Dewar’s White Label and the concentrated John Begg Blue Cap. I’m not sure any of us were convinced enough by the tasting to trade in distinctive single malts for mild blends. “It’s not an exciting group,” David said. “They’re for drinkers who do not want to be challenged.” Yet they have a clear place as a component for mixed drinks, whether Scotch and sodas or the few classic Scotch cocktails like Rob Roys and Rusty Nails. Aside from those, I’ll always have my fragrant memories. ★★★½ Buchanan’s Master Blended Scotch Whisky 40 percent $48, 750 milliliters Smoky, rich and creamy, with discernible malt flavors that linger.

The same goes for a Scotch-based cocktail like a Rob Roy, for which these whiskies are particularly suited. Actually almost any tidbit — notably pigs in blankets — that the bar sends my way will satisfy. But that bottle of workmanlike Scotch can also contribute its alcohol and flavor to the cooking process. I have soaked dried currants in whisky to add to a simple chocolate cake. Here, taking my cue from the Blood and Sand cocktail, made with orange juice and Scotch, I used the spirit to bolster a warm bread pudding laced with orange, both grated zest and candied peel, and finished with a marmalade and whiskey glaze. Supermarkets and fancy food shops, as well as online sources, sell candied orange peel. But absent that ingredient you can substitute slivered dried Turkish apricots.

2018,Opinion | Does Gay Hollywood Have Room for Queer Kids?,"Op-Ed Contributor As an undergraduate at Duke University, I was something of a campus unicorn. I was anything but quiet about my sexuality and my gender identity. I’d hold my head high sporting bright red lipstick and a full beard; dance on the bar, unshaven legs exposed by a miniskirt; strut unashamed across cobblestones in four-inch heels. I wasn’t just gay — I was a total queen. And for half of the gay men on campus, I was something of a goddess, an inspiration, a friend. But for the other half, I was embarrassing. I was that flamboyant gay kid who made everyone else look bad by association. Many gay men on campus were so unsettled by me, so vicariously ashamed of my gender expression, that they’d avoid eye contact, wouldn’t even talk to me. The irony is that these very gay men were allowed to be “normal” because I was the campus freak. My unabashed femininity was what paved the way for gay men in, say, fraternities to come out without jeopardizing their masculinity. I was the shameful femme foil to their butch pride. At the same time as they disavowed me, they profited from my existence. I had flashbacks to my campus years this weekend when I went to see the movie “Love, Simon.” From what I’d heard, it was a revelation: a film that effortlessly normalized the queer experience in a touching, quirky and beautiful way, a film so important that celebrities were buying out theaters in their hometowns so that gay teenagers could see it free. I walked out at the end in a shambles, a veritable genderqueer mess. For over a decade, the unspoken rule of gay cinema and television has been that gay men can be sexy protagonists — as long as they are masculine gay men. Feminine or gender-nonconforming gay men, on the other hand, are desexualized comedic relief. Masculine gay men are central characters, understood as attractive, powerful, interesting and dynamic. Feminine gay men, gender-nonconforming folks and trans people are, at best, guest stars, denied real plots, romantic story lines or central positions in the story. Worse, across mainstream movies and television, gay protagonists often gain their status as protagonists and palatability by distancing themselves from femininity. Take “Will & Grace”: Will Truman is acceptable in part because he is not Jack McFarland. Or “Queer as Folk”: Brian Kinney is acceptable in part because he is not Emmett Honeycutt. Or even the reboot of “Queer Eye”: Antoni Porowski and Karamo Brown are the heartthrobs in part because they’re more masculine than Jonathan Van Ness. If “Love, Simon” didn’t follow this trope outright, it certainly flirted with it. Early on, the film is careful to establish all of the ways that Simon is not that kind of gay. He’s not very good at musical theater. He participates in gender policing, deriding a straight classmate who chooses to wear a dress to the Halloween party as looking like a “drag queen who rolled around in refrigerator magnets.” He fantasizes about what being gay in college will be like, imagining choreography and dance, only to retreat: “Well, maybe not that gay.” But the most frustrating story line comes via the character Ethan. A black, femme gay guy who wears ascots and keeps his hair long and straightened, Ethan has been out at Simon’s school since sophomore year. He is the gender-nonconforming queer kid who blazed the trail and bears the brunt of the bullying and harassment because of it. He is openly bullied in front of Simon; he retorts in powerful, queenly fashion to his tormentors as Simon remains silent, watching and cringing. As a genderqueer kid who has always been too femme for my own good, I found Ethan to be the only character in the film I could relate to. And he is relegated to narrative obscurity for most of the movie. He is a sideshow, a subtle foil to show how palatable and masculine Simon is. He is the narratively irrelevant queen to Simon’s well-adjusted gay boy. Simon’s palatability hinges in large part on Ethan’s presence, and the film never really does anything to acknowledge that. A message that gay young people receive throughout our adolescence is that you need to be the “right type of gay” — masculine, not flamboyant, a man’s man — to be respected, to be affirmed by your family or to be romantically desirable. These messages hurt. They sting. They linger. And they don’t end with adolescence, evidenced by the many online dating profiles proclaiming “no fats, no femmes.” I spent the entire movie waiting for Simon and Ethan to reconcile, to have a moment where Simon owned up to being embarrassed to be around someone as feminine as Ethan. I kept waiting for the scene when Simon said something like: “I’m sorry. I was embarrassed by you because I was working on myself. I struggled to affirm your femininity because I was acting from a place of personal shame. Your courage has paved the way for my life to be easier, and I wish I would’ve stood up for you.” But it never happened. It’s important to acknowledge that — in 2018, with a $17 million budget — “Love, Simon” is trailblazing, that for L.G.B.T. teenagers, it is the only thing like it out there. But it’s equally important to acknowledge that the “Love, Simon” team reiterated the trope of the queenly, femme supporting character with no real plot. As femme gay men, gender-nonconforming people, and trans folks, we too deserve better than to be caricatured by Hollywood.",The New York Times
2018,Does Having a Day Job Mean Making Better Art?,"The Artist’s Life ONCE UPON A time, artists had jobs. And not “advising the Library of Congress on its newest Verdi acquisition” jobs, but job jobs, the kind you hear about in stump speeches. Think of T.S. Eliot, conjuring “The Waste Land” (1922) by night and overseeing foreign accounts at Lloyds Bank during the day, or Wallace Stevens, scribbling lines of poetry on his two-mile walk to work, then handing them over to his secretary to transcribe at the insurance agency where he supervised real estate claims. The avant-garde composer Philip Glass shocked at least one music lover when he materialized, smock-clad and brandishing plumber’s tools, in a home with a malfunctioning appliance. “While working,” Glass recounted to The Guardian in 2001, “I suddenly heard a noise and looked up to find Robert Hughes, the art critic of Time magazine, staring at me in disbelief. ‘But you’re Philip Glass! What are you doing here?’ It was obvious that I was installing his dishwasher and I told him that I would soon be finished. ‘But you are an artist,’ he protested. I explained that I was an artist but that I was sometimes a plumber as well and that he should go away and let me finish.” What is an artist supposed to be? The figure this anecdote suggests — holed up in an airy turret with her materials, descending only to glissade through parties and openings — may be the one of popular imagination, but she is also a recent phenomenon, a product of our fetishization of genius. She doesn’t work, likely because she makes so much money she doesn’t need to. As a consequence, her talent can start to feel corruptible, like easily torn silk, or larger than life. (Either way, all the more reason to avoid the office.) But even the celebrity painters of the past half-century had to hustle at one point. As David Salle — who was financially insolvent at the time of his first show, held at the loft of a young dealer named Larry Gagosian in 1979 — admitted in a 2005 lecture, “It was common not to expect to be able to live from your art” in 1970s New York. Inclusion in the city’s top exhibitions during the ’80s brought Salle the fame that allowed him to spend “most days in my studio, alone,” no supplementary income required. Artistic success, it can often seem, means earning enough money from your art not to have to take a job. And when contemporary creators do seek additional employment (which they frequently must), they mostly hew to work that falls within the range of their skills or talents. The novelist goes into screenwriting, like Dave Eggers or Ray Bradbury. The poet becomes an ad man, like James Dickey, who crafted slogans for Coca-Cola. (“I was selling my soul to the devil all day … and trying to buy it back at night,” he said, after getting fired for not meeting deadlines.) Stephen Dunn viewed corporate copywriting as a wan reflection of his real calling, the moon to poetry’s sun, albeit in a zero-sum universe in which the moon gobbles up the sun’s radiance. Meanwhile, the painter paints walls or signs (as did Willem de Kooning, who also worked as a carpenter) or — like Barbara Kruger, subbing in as a graphic designer for Mademoiselle magazine — illustrates text. The sculptor builds sets, à la Alexander Calder, who lent an eerie sensibility to Erik Satie’s 1936 voice and orchestra piece “Socrate” with his simple backdrop: a red disc, interlocking steel hoops, a black-and-white rectangle and a turquoise screen. But then there is another category of artists-with-jobs: people whose two professions play off each other in unexpected ways. For these creators, a trade isn’t just about paying the bills; it’s something that grounds them in reality. In 2017, a day job might perform the same replenishing ministries as sleep or a long run: relieving creative angst, restoring the artist to her body and to the texture of immediate experience. But this break is also fieldwork. For those who want to mine daily life for their art, a second job becomes an umbilical cord fastened to something vast and breathing. The alternate gig that lifts you out of your process also supplies fodder for when that process resumes. Lost time is regained as range and perspective, the artist acquiring yet one more mode of inhabiting the world. THE ACT OF producing art can be anything but romantic. To escape the blank page, the only thing on earth as passive as yourself, you cast about for distractions, half-convinced that avoiding your project will shower some sort of mystical growth hormone on your ideas. Yet for some artists, such as William Carlos Williams, life and art were more than each other’s palate cleansers. The poet doctor saw his dual vocations as mysteriously fused. “They are two parts of a whole,” he contended in his 1967 autobiography. “It is not two jobs at all … one rests the man when the other fatigues him.” As a physician, Williams developed an antenna for the “inarticulate poems” emanating from his patients, even as he resolved to “use the material I knew” from practicing medicine in his writing. What, then, is the real relationship between art and trade? Agonistic? Complementary? The question, suggesting something like a creative sanctum shimmering a few meters above the room in which you punch a clock or schedule a meeting, supposes that aesthetic experience is categorically different from everyday experience, and that muse-fueled invention floats apart from earthier forms of productivity. But those borders have a tricky way of dispersing. Frank O’Hara’s 1964 “Lunch Poems,” a set of imagistic, peripatetic musings on a city in motion, are beloved in part because they manage to articulate the balance of work and life. Written on his breaks, their title an invitation to us to read them on ours, the seemingly dashed-off lines celebrate the pleasure a mind can take in wandering through its own busyness: Creative practice can be meditative flow, but it can also be worthy of a Ricky Gervais punch line. The author Sujatha Gidla, whose recent memoir, “Ants Among Elephants,” examined India’s caste system, has been a conductor for the New York City subway since 2009. “I’m very disorganized,” she told me immediately, before I could frame my first question. “You must factor that in to how difficult it is to manage work and writing.” But for all the stress of brainstorming ideas during her commute and transcribing interviews in the M.T.A. break room, Gidla would never quit her day job. “It’s masculine; I fancy it,” she said. What’s more, Gidla fervently believes that the individual “should be participating in social production, something useful for society.” She has met people from all over the world (“even Liberia”) at the M.T.A., drinking in their “cosmopolitanism and openness.” She enjoys their company. “Writing is kind of lonely,” she said. “It doesn’t make me feel like, this is my environment. At work I have no choice but to talk to people.” Some cultivate their art because it sustains their work, or because it fulfills a sense of civic responsibility. Writing children’s literature “has helped me grow in confidence as a person, which in turn has helped me develop … as an officer, too,” said Gavin Puckett, a U.K.-based policeman (it remains his primary income source) and author of the prizewinning 2013 “Fables From the Stables” series. Puckett, who joined the service in 1998, sketched the rhyming adventure “Murray the Horse” after passing a horse in a field while listening to a radio announcer report on “sports and activities you can only complete backwards” — he imagined a story about a horse that runs in reverse. He admits that telling stories still makes him feel as though he’s “stepping out of character.” “My role as a police officer came first,” he told me. Others are pulled, almost involuntarily, the other way. Edi Rama, the Prime Minister of Albania, sometimes feels his hand doodling as he contemplates a political decision. The art pours out to center and steady him. In 1998, Rama left a promising career as an artist in Paris to become Albania’s minister of culture. Now the country’s leader, he shows his loose, improvisatory drawings and sculptures in galleries around the world. “I found myself drawing almost all my working time whilst interacting with people in my office or on the phone,” he said in a 2016 interview. “I began to understand that my subconscious was being helped … by my hand to stay calm while my conscious had to focus on demanding topics.” Art, so often the wild or ephemeral factor in this equation, stabilizes the politician. Do politics abet the artist? Unlike Williams, Rama does not borrow directly from his waking life for subject matter; he aims to explore automated and preconscious processes. But perhaps the day’s noise makes the quiet of drawing more numinous and clarifying. A year ago, Rama papered the walls of the Kryeministria, Albania’s main government building, with his own compositions. He wanted to remind himself of spaces in which “politics, with its characters and struggles, has evaporated” — to appreciate a freedom he might otherwise forget he had. BACK TO THE artist in her turret. Though ethereal, she possesses monomaniacal focus. She can barely cook for herself, let alone pursue other hobbies. Her cultural ascent coincides with the waning of another figure: the renaissance person, who is allowed to excel at multiple things. At the risk of overliteralizing, one of the West’s foundational creatives, Leonardo da Vinci, held down at least a dozen occupations, from cartographer to engineer to painter to architect. But today, we ridicule Tom Hanks for composing short stories, Steve Martin for trying his hand at a novella, James Franco for making a run at poetry. Why do we rain down suspicion on those who seem ruled by competing creative impulses? In this moment when our pieties about identity are unraveling to admit more nuance, what’s wrong with letting people do two things at once? Some artists may try to simultaneously grow both of their undertakings — and yet the balance shifts from year to year. Tanwi Nandini Islam launched Hi Wildflower, a line of perfumes, candles and beauty products in 2014, 12 months before her debut novel, “Bright Lines,” arrived in bookstores. She needed a space for her “olfactory experiments,” she told me, referring to the fragrant projects she’d started as a species of “method writing” while crafting a story about an apothecary. At first, Islam imagined the two endeavors — the company and the writing — as “sisters,” more similar than different. She inscribed lines of poetry on the candles’ packaging and enmeshed herself in every aspect of design and production. Hi Wildflower also became a form of introspection, “a space to rethink my values,” Islam said. The business was separate from the work of book-composing, but not conceptually distant from it: Islam envisioned her aromatherapy and skin-care artifacts moving through the public sphere in the same tender way her sentences did. Yet as Hi Wildflower developed into the author’s main source of income, morphing from an alternate expression of the energies that drove her fiction into “a way of keeping afloat in a society that doesn’t pay artists to do their work,” its meaning mutated. The company now has three employees, 70 products and distribution ties to boutique retailers. Business is where Islam works; writing is where she dreams and roams. She no longer notates individual candle wrappers with poems, and she’s delegated some of the more menial production tasks. When I spoke to her, Islam was at work on a collection of poems and a second novel. Meanwhile, Hi Wildflower, an erstwhile extension of her aesthetic self, has clumped off into its own entity, an enterprise that props her up materially and gives her space to write. Financial security (for now, at least) is not the only thing the business has bequeathed Islam. “When I create, I want this sense of quietness and wisdom to seep in,” she told me, echoing Rama. “But leading a company has made me tough on myself as an artist. You experience so much discomfort [in writing]: pitching articles, revising, building your brand. Having a business primes you for that kind of grind, that hustle.” In “A Room of One’s Own” (1929), her famous, passionate argument about the material conditions necessary for writing, Virginia Woolf compared fiction to a “spider’s web, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.” It is a lovely vision of art hanging from the beams of reality, only people are not spiders — they don’t generate just one thing. The trope of the secluded creator has echoes of imprisonment and stasis. (After all, who wants to spend all their time in one room, even if it belongs to them?) Sometimes the artist needs to turn off, to get out in the fray, to stop worrying over when her imagination’s pot will boil — because, of course, it won’t if she’s watching. And regardless of whether the reboot results in brilliance down the line, that lunchtime stroll isn’t going to take itself, those stray thoughts won’t think themselves, the characters on the corner certainly won’t gawk at themselves. Artists: They’re just like us, unless they can afford not to be, in which case they still are, but doing a better job of concealing it.",The New York Times
2018,Does Hell Exist? And Did the Pope Give an Answer?,"ROME — The Vatican felt obliged this week to reaffirm that Pope Francis believes in a central tenet of Catholicism, that there is a hell. That odd declaration came after the newspaper La Repubblica published a front-page article on Thursday by an atheist, left-wing and anticlerical giant of Italian journalism, who reported that during a recent meeting the pope had said that hell did not exist. Bad souls are “not punished,” the journalist, Eugenio Scalfari, 93, reported the pope as saying. “A hell doesn’t exist.” Nor, for Mr. Scalfari, does a tape recorder or notebook or the orthodoxy of quotation marks. The Vatican characterized the remarks as misquotations. In the past, Mr. Scalfari, the founder of La Repubblica, a bible of the Italian left that he edited for decades, has admitted to sometimes putting words in the papal mouth. But the infernal remarks, especially as the pope prepared for Easter Sunday celebrations, proved too tempting for international tabloids, conservative websites antagonistic to the pope and many others to let go. “Pope Declares No Hell,” read a screaming headline across the Drudge Report website. “Does the Pope Believe in Hell?” asked Patrick J. Buchanan in an online column. “Vatican literally falls apart after Pope Francis says ‘Hell doesn’t exist,’” read a headline in Metro UK, a British newspaper. The pope, in fact, has often talked about hell as a very real final destination for the wicked, and the Vatican made clear that the “literal words pronounced by the pope are not quoted” and that “no quotation of the article should be considered as a faithful transcription of the words of the Holy Father.” Mr. Scalfari agreed. “They are perfectly right,” said Mr. Scalfari in an interview on Friday night, as the pope prepared for a ceremonial leading of the stations of the cross on Good Friday. “These are not interviews, these are meetings, I don’t take notes. It’s a chat.” While Mr. Scalfari said he remembered the pope saying hell did not exist, he allowed that “I can also make mistakes.” He said he had committed an error of omission by failing to fully explain the pope’s answer on the need for a stronger Europe. “At my age,” Mr. Scalfari said, he was more used to being interviewed than interviewing. The editor of La Repubblica, Mario Calabresi, said the paper had not labeled Mr. Scalfari’s piece as an interview. It was, Mr. Calabresi said, the fruit of a “cultural exchange and dialogue out of the 19th century between a Jesuit believer and a man of the enlightenment fascinated by religion.” Sophisticated readers of Italian journalism understand how to read Mr. Scalfari, which is to say, with a grain of salt when it comes to papal quotations. To many here, Mr. Scalfari personifies an impressionistic style of Italian journalism, prevalent in its coverage of the Vatican, politics and much else, in which the gist is more important than the verbatim, and the spirit greater than the letter. And yet, despite the public relations headaches Mr. Scalfari has caused, Francis, 81, seems to like talking to him. The pope, Mr. Scalfari said, has a “need to talk with a nonbeliever who stimulates him.” This month’s meeting was their fifth. In September 2013, Francis sent a letter to Mr. Scalfari, later published in La Repubblica, in which the pontiff wrote that atheists should “abide by their own conscience” and said that Christians should engage in “a sincere and rigorous dialogue” with nonbelievers. Weeks later, the pope had a long discussion with Mr. Scalfari, the reconstructed transcript of which the journalist published in La Repubblica. “Each one has his idea of good and evil and must choose to follow the good and fight the evil as he understands them,” the pope said, according to Mr. Scalfari. He added that efforts to convert people to Christianity amounted to “solemn nonsense.” At first, the Vatican’s spokesman at the time, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, confirmed the interview as “faithful to the thought.” He subsequently published the article in its entirety on L’Osservatore Romano, the Vatican’s official outlet, and in a space on the website of the Holy See usually reserved for papal speeches. Then the Vatican, which recently digitally blurred out embarrassing lines of a letter sent by Pope Benedict XVI, removed the text from its website. “There were some misunderstandings and disagreements about its value,” Father Lombardi said back then. The two men spoke again in July 2014, and Mr. Scalfari published an article in which he said the pope had estimated that 8,000 members of the clergy, including bishops and cardinals, were pedophiles and that perhaps priestly celibacy should be reconsidered. The Vatican responded by asking whether a lack of quotation marks suggested “an attempt to manipulate some naïve readers.” In 2015, Mr. Scalfari quoted Francis as having said that “all the divorced and remarried who ask will be admitted” to Communion. Father Lombardi responded that observers “know the way Scalfari writes.” But throughout, the Vatican has seemed reluctant to bring down the hammer on an erudite man toward whom the pope apparently had grown affectionate. Francis stayed in touch with Mr. Scalfari, calling him on the phone and inviting him in for another long chat in November 2016. Mr. Scalfari described their warm greetings and reported that the pope said, “It is the communists who think like Christians.” This week’s controversy is not the first time Mr. Scalfari and the pope have visited the subject of hell. In October 2017, Mr. Scalfari wrote, “Pope Francis has abolished the places where souls were supposed to go after death: hell, purgatory, heaven.” But the pope, who is surrounded by a court full of politically attuned cardinals, yes men and conservatives trying to undercut his mission, keeps coming back to Mr. Scalfari. “We’ve become friends,” Mr. Scalfari said, recalling that the pope helped him into his car during the last visit, and that this time he walked him to the door. “He blessed me, but knowing that I’m not faithful, he blew me a kiss. And I responded in the same mode.” An earlier version of this article misidentified Pope Francis’ predecessor. He was Benedict XVI, not Benedict XI.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Does Nancy Pelosi Deserve to Keep her Job?,"David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First. Facebook’s privacy violations have led to a #DeleteFacebook campaign. “It is time,” Brian Acton, co-founder of WhatsApp, which was sold to Facebook for $19 billion, writes. But Slate’s April Glaser argues that deletion is a privilege that many people, like small-business owners, can’t afford. The solution, she says, isn’t to abandon Facebook — which probably isn’t realistic on a mass scale anyway. The solution is to fix Facebook. “If you think Facebook is worth deleting over its issues, then call your elected official to regulate the company, as well as other companies, like Google, that profit from harvesting our personal details to sell ads tailored to us across the internet,” Glaser writes. “Because it’s becoming clearer that we can’t trust these companies to regulate themselves.” The Pelosi question. A few years ago, Steve Cohen — a Democratic congressman from Memphis — had some buttons made. Each button said, “PelosiCare,” underneath a photo of Nancy Pelosi. At the bottom of the button, in smaller type, were the words “I was there.” The point was clear enough. Everyone else may refer to the huge expansion of health insurance as Obamacare. But the Democratic members of Congress who voted for it know that it would not have happened without Pelosi. When Obama administration officials wavered over whether to keep pushing for such an ambitious bill, Pelosi bucked them up. Then she delivered the votes to pass the bill. That’s been the pattern since Pelosi became the Democrats’ House leader in 2003. She pushes hard for liberal policies, but also has a keen understanding of what legislation can’t get through Congress, no matter how much she may personally favor it. She has probably done a better job of keeping her caucus unified, in the majority and minority, than any other recent congressional leader. “She has been an extraordinarily effective caucus leader,” as Jonathan Chait writes in New York magazine. Pelosi’s leadership does come with downsides, though. She is unpopular in much of the country, and she hasn’t figured out how to win enough elections to retake control of the House since Democrats lost it in 2010. As a result, there is growing talk about whether she should step aside. Why is Pelosi unpopular? For starters, it’s normal for House leaders to become unpopular over time, as Matthew Green noted on the Monkey Cage blog (with a nice comparative chart). Pelosi has also made some mistakes, mishandling the recent John Conyers sexual-harassment case and, as Gail Collins notes, failing to provide leadership paths for younger House members. But Pelosi’s unpopularity also feels different. She has remained the Republicans’ favorite bogeywoman — appearing in ad after ad — long after the Democrats were last in the majority and she was speaker. Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate leader, never became the target that Pelosi did, nor has Chuck Schumer, Reid’s successor. In an Atlantic piece, Peter Beinart lays out some strong evidence that sexism is a major reason. Beinart walks through the data on Republican ads that feature Pelosi as well as the social-science research on the prejudices that voters hold against female politicians. “For women politicians to succeed, they must defeat and outmaneuver men,” Beinart writes. “Yet the better at it they are, the more detested they become.” Whatever the cause of her unpopularity, Democrats still have a dilemma: Is she the best House leader for the party? My own view is that Pelosi should remain in her job at least through this year’s campaign. She probably doesn’t actually influence many voters, Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg points out. And her effectiveness in holding together her caucus should not be taken for granted, as Chait notes. If the Democrats fail to win back the House this year, Pelosi will probably step aside, and she should. If they win, she’ll deserve to be the speaker again. Pelosi will also turn 78 next week, and she would do her party a favor by starting to think about a succession plan. If she were to step aside by the end of 2020, she would have had an 18-year run as her party’s House leader — one of the most successful tenures in modern politics. Elsewhere, Elena Schneider and Heather Caygle of Politico explain why more Democratic candidates are disavowing Pelosi, and Bernstein, in that Bloomberg piece, argues Pelosi should stay but her 78-year-old deputy, Steny Hoyer, should go.

2018,Does Recovery Kill Great Writing?,"Feature As I emerged from alcoholism, I had to face down a terrifying question. CreditCreditPhoto illustration by Cristiana Couceiro. Source photograph: Igor Ustynskyy/Getty Images The first time I felt it — the buzz — I was almost 13. I didn’t vomit or black out or even embarrass myself. I just loved it. I loved the crackle of Champagne, its hot pine needles down my throat. We were celebrating my brother’s college graduation, and I wore a long muslin dress that made me feel like a child, until I felt something else: initiated, aglow. The whole world stood accused: You never told me it felt this good. The first time I drank in secret, I was 15. My mom was out of town. My friends and I spread a blanket across the living-room hardwood and drank whatever we could find in the fridge, the chardonnay wedged between the orange juice and the mayonnaise. We were giddy from the sense of trespass. The first time I got high, I was smoking pot on a stranger’s couch, dampening the joint between fingers dripping with pool water. A friend of a friend had invited me to a swimming party. My hair smelled like chlorine, and my body quivered against my damp bikini. Strange little animals blossomed through my elbows and shoulders, where the parts of me bent and connected. I thought: What is this? And how can it keep being this? With a good feeling, it was always: More. Again. Forever. The first time I drank with a boy, I let him put his hands under my shirt on the wooden balcony of a lifeguard station. Dark waves shushed the sand below our dangling feet. My first boyfriend: He liked to get high. He liked to get his cat high. We used to make out in his mother’s minivan. He came to a family meal at my house fully wired on speed. “So talkative!” said my grandma, deeply smitten. At Disneyland, he broke open a baggie of withered mushroom caps and started breathing fast and shallow in line for Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, sweating through his shirt, pawing at the orange rocks of the fake frontier. If I had to say where my drinking began — which first time began it — I might say it started with my first blackout, or maybe the first time I sought blackout: the first time I wanted nothing more than to be absent from my own life. Maybe it started the first time I threw up from drinking; the first time I dreamed about drinking; the first time I lied about drinking; the first time I dreamed about lying about drinking, when the craving had become so deep that there wasn’t much of me that wasn’t committed to either serving or fighting it. I started drinking every day when I was in graduate school in Iowa City, where getting drunk daily didn’t seem dramatic and pronounced so much as encompassing and inevitable. There were so many ways and places to get drunk: the fiction-writers’ bar in a smoky double-wide trailer, with a stuffed fox head and a bunch of broken clocks; the poets’ bar down the street, with its anemic cheeseburgers and glowing Schlitz ad, a scrolling electric landscape with a gurgling stream and neon grassy banks, a flickering waterfall. I mashed the lime in my vodka tonic and glimpsed — in the sweet spot between two drinks and three, then three and four, then four and five — my life as something illuminated from the inside. There were parties at a place called the Farm House, out in the cornfields, where poets wrestled in a kiddie pool full of Jell-O, and everyone’s profile looked beautiful in the crackling light of a mattress bonfire. Winter took us below zero. There were endless potlucks where older writers brought braised meats and younger writers brought plastic tubs of hummus, and everyone brought whiskey, and everyone brought wine. Winter kept going; we kept drinking. Then it was spring. We kept drinking then too. The first time I told the story of my drinking, I sat among other drinkers who no longer drank. Ours was a familiar scene: circled folding chairs, foam cups of coffee gone lukewarm, phone numbers exchanged. Before the meeting, I imagined what might happen after it was done: People would compliment my story or the way I’d told it, and I’d demur, Well, I’m a writer, shrugging, trying not to make too big a deal out of it. I practiced with notecards beforehand. It was after I’d gone through the part about my abortion, and how much I’d been drinking pregnant; after the part about the night I don’t call date rape, and the etiquette of reconstructing blackouts — it was somewhere in the muddled territory of sobriety, getting to the repetitions of apology or the physical mechanics of prayer, that an old man in a wheelchair, sitting in the front row, started shouting: “This is boring!” We all knew him, this old man. He was instrumental in setting up a gay recovery community in our town, back in the ’70s, and now he was in the care of his much-younger, soft-spoken partner, who changed the man’s diapers and wheeled him faithfully to meetings where he shouted obscenities. He was ill, losing the parts of his mind that filtered and restrained his speech; “Kiss me, wench!” he once said, as he held my hand for our closing prayer. But he often sounded like our collective id, saying all the things that were never said aloud in meetings: I don’t care. This is tedious. I’ve heard this before. He was nasty and sour, and he had also saved a lot of people’s lives. Now he was bored. Other people at the meeting shifted uncomfortably in their seats. The woman sitting beside me touched my arm, a way of saying, Don’t stop. So I didn’t. I kept going — stuttering, eyes hot, throat swollen — but this man had managed to tap veins of primal insecurity: that my story wasn’t good enough, or that I’d failed to tell it right, that I’d somehow failed at my dysfunction, failed to make it bad or bold or interesting enough; that recovery had flatlined my story past narrative repair. During the early days of my drinking, I was drawn to the legendary writer-drunks. I understood their drinking as proof of extreme interior weather. If you needed to drink that much, you had to hurt, and drinking and writing were two different responses to that same molten pain: You could numb it, or you could grant it a voice. While I was studying at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I spent my nights at the writers’ bars on Market Street, and I spent my days reading the other writers who had gotten drunk in that town before I’d gotten drunk there: John Berryman, Raymond Carver, Denis Johnson. The myths of their drinking ran like subterranean rivers underneath all the drinking I was doing. Their drinking seemed like proof of their proximity to the terror and profundity of psychic darkness. As Patricia Highsmith argued, drinking allowed the artist to “see the truth, the simplicity and the primitive emotions once more.” Jack London wrote about the “imaginative” drunk for whom the “white light of alcohol” granted access to bleak truths about the human conditions — what he called “the pitiless, spectral syllogisms of the white logic.” Booze was illumination and consolation. It helped you see, and then it helped you survive the sight. Denis Johnson’s short-story collection “Jesus’ Son” was our bible of beauty and damage, a hallucinated vision of how and where we lived. Half the book took place in Iowa City bars; its stories were full of farmhouse parties and hungover mornings. There was a dilapidated old house where people smoked pharmaceutical opium and said things like: “McInnes isn’t feeling too good today. I just shot him.” Johnson’s protagonist looked at the giant screen of a drive-in theater in the cornfields and saw a sacred vision: “The sky was torn away and the angels were descending out of a brilliant blue summer, their huge faces streaked with light and full of pity.” He had mistaken the ordinary Iowa around us for something sacred, and drugs and booze had helped him do it. One of Johnson’s poems described being “just a poor mortal human having stumbled onto/the glen where the failed gods are drinking.” That’s what it felt like to drink in Iowa. This sense of affinity had been passed down like a half-glorious, half-absurd inheritance. But if mythic intoxication was an inheritance, who had the right to claim it? It seemed like a family tree composed almost entirely of men. Women rarely got to strike the same roguish silhouettes. “When a woman drinks it’s as if an animal were drinking, or a child,” Marguerite Duras wrote. A woman’s drinking is often understood less as the necessary antidote to her own staggering wisdom and more as self-indulgence or melodrama, hysteria, an unpardonable affliction. This is only one of many double standards, of course. Some addicts are pitied, others are blamed. Race and class have everything to do with this abiding cognitive dissonance. But in Iowa, I didn’t see this context. I just wanted entry to the boys’ club. I wanted to understand my drinking as part of a story about the kind of creativity that had to happen past the boundaries of comfort. As Berryman himself put it in his poem “Dream Song 57”: “Something can (has) been said for sobriety/but very little.” Sitting on a folding chair in a church basement, you always face the question of how to begin — how to assemble your private ledger of traumas into what people in meetings call a drunkalog. The early days of my drinking are the easiest ones to dress in costumes of nostalgia: drinking in smoky bars with other 22-year-olds who dreamed of becoming writers; running drunk through the peeling paint of the French Quarter, riding piggyback on my boyfriend, both of us fueled by shots of well bourbon; drinking lukewarm rum by candlelight during power outages in Nicaragua. But the truer story of my drinking is really a story about tedium, about claustrophobia and repetition. At a certain point, it started to expose itself as something that wasn’t revelry, that wasn’t about connection but isolation, that wasn’t about dark wisdom or metaphysical angst — that wasn’t about anything, really, besides the urge to get drunk, by myself, with no one watching. The night of my first meeting, when I was 26 and desperate, I drove across the river to an address near the hospital, crying all the way across the Burlington Street Bridge, my tears streaking the streetlamps into bright white rain. It was almost Halloween: cobwebs on porches, hanging ghosts made from stuffed sheets, jack-o’-lanterns with their crooked grins. Being drunk was like having a candle lit inside you. I already missed it. The first two times I had stopped drinking, I didn’t go to meetings. It seemed like crossing an irrevocable threshold. Those times, some part of me suspected I would probably end up drinking again, and I didn’t want voices from meetings chiding me when I did. But this time I wanted to cross a line — to make it harder to go back. It was like taking out an insurance policy against the version of myself who — days from now, weeks from now, months from now — would miss the drinking so much she’d say: I want to try again. I wasn’t quitting because I wanted to quit. I had woken up that morning, just like every other morning, wanting to drink more than I wanted to do anything else. Quitting seemed like the only way I would ever arrive at a life where drinking wasn’t the thing I wanted to do most when I woke up. When I imagined a meeting, I pictured grizzled men in a church basement talking about their D.T.s and their time in detox wards, gripping their foam cups with trembling hands. I pictured what I’d seen on television: slow claps and nodding heads, earnest mmm-hmms. But I didn’t know what else to try. When I reached the gravel parking lot of the address I’d copied down, it was just a clapboard house, not a church. But the lights were on. For 10 minutes I sat in my car without killing the engine, heat blasting, wiping my snotty nose with the back of my wrist, jamming my fists into my eyes to make them stop crying. I was searching for a story I could tell myself that would take me back home: Maybe I’ll come back tomorrow, maybe I don’t have to be here, maybe I can do this on my own, maybe I don’t have to do it at all. The meeting itself — once I willed myself out of the car, into the cold and through the lit doorway — was just a bunch of strangers gathered around a huge wooden table, past a kitchen tracked with footprints, old linoleum curling upward at the edges of the room. People smiled as if they were glad to see me, almost as if they’d been expecting me. A sheet cake on the table was frosted in muted sunset tones. A man called Bug was celebrating an unthinkable amount of time without booze. He described staying in his apartment for 40 days straight — without leaving, without going anywhere, like Christ in the desert of a low-rent Iowa condo — and getting handles of vodka delivered to his door. I thought: I never got that bad. And then: Vodka delivery actually sounds pretty great. When Bug described how he’d gotten there — starting with the ritual of a vodka tonic with the 6 o’clock news, his whole day built around it — I thought, Yep. Imagining the rest of my life without that relief made me sick to my stomach. But in that room, I felt a different relief, just an inkling: the eerie immediacy of hearing myself spoken out loud. These people didn’t know anything about me, but they knew one part of me — the part that thought about drinking all day, every day — better than anyone else. I tucked myself quietly in a corner. I wasn’t sure what to say aside from my name — which, as it turned out, was enough. Once I got sober, I became more interested in the question of what little, as Berryman put it, could be said for sobriety. If addiction stories ran on the fuel of darkness — the hypnotic spiral of an ongoing, deepening crisis — then recovery often seemed like the narrative slack, the dull terrain of wellness, a tedious addendum to the riveting blaze. I wasn’t immune; I’d always been enthralled by stories of wreckage. But when I got sober, I wanted to know if stories about getting better could ever be as compelling as stories about falling apart. I needed to believe they could. Over the years, I’d come to realize that many of my drunk icons had actually gotten sober eventually, or tried to, and I went looking for proof that recovery had not blunted or destroyed their creativity. It was like the desire the poet Eavan Boland confessed when she asked for poems with women who weren’t beautiful or young: “I want a poem/I can grow old in. I want a poem I can die in.” I wanted a story I could get sober in. Many of the writers I’d come to idolize were famous for work that evoked the pulsing dysfunction of their addictions: the slurred voices and wild visions of Berryman’s “Dream Songs,” or the weary distances of Carver’s short stories, their tense conversations strewn with silences. The work that evoked sobriety — much less recovery — had often faded into obscurity, out of print or unpublished, lodged deep in file boxes in hushed university libraries. At Berryman’s archives in Minneapolis, I found A.A. step-work covered with coffee stains and cigarette burns. The inventory he completed when he arrived at rehab in 1970, in a Minneapolis hospital called St. Mary’s, spelled out the wasteland his drinking had made of his life: Wife left me after 11 yrs of marriage bec. of drinking. Despair, heavy drinking alone, jobless, penniless in N.Y. ... Seduced students drunk. ... My chairman told me I had called up a student drunk at midnight & threatened to kill her. ... Drunk in Calcutta, wandered streets lost all night, unable to remember my address. ... Wet bed drunk in London hotel, manager furious, had to pay for new mattress, $100. ... Defecated uncontrollably in a University corridor, got home unnoticed. ... My wife said St. Mary’s or else. Came here. After his first few stints at rehab, Berryman began to think about writing a novel called “Recovery”: “make a book of these notes — useful 12th step work — probably hardly worked up at all, only expanded and glossed, with some background ... on Hazelden and St Mary’s last spring. ...” When Berryman described the novel as “useful 12th step work,” he was imagining the potential impact it might have on other alcoholics — that it might help them understand their addictions more fully, or come to believe in the possibilities of recovery. But I suspect he was also hoping the novel could do something for him, that it might prove that his sober energies could be translated into a new kind of creative project — less stylistically adorned, perhaps (“hardly worked up at all”) but just as deeply felt, and more explicitly geared toward emotional generosity — the project of reaching others in their desperation. Berryman had long cherished his reputation as a drunken sage — had loved, for instance, the seven-page profile Life magazine published in 1967, with a photograph of him in a Dublin bar surrounded by foam-lipped pints. “Whisky and ink, whisky and ink, these are the fluids John Berryman needs,” the article began. “He needs them to survive and describe the thing that sets him apart from other men and even from other poets: his uncommonly, almost maddeningly penetrating awareness of the fact of human mortality.” But by the time Berryman started working on “Recovery,” he had come to see the notion that he needed to drink in order to write as a delusion. “So long as I considered myself as merely the medium of (arena for) my powers, sobriety was out of the question,” he wrote in his journals in 1971. “The even deeper delusion that my art depended on my drinking, or at least was connected with it, could not be attakt directly. Too far down. The cover had to be exploded off.” The protagonist of “Recovery” is a renowned professor of immunology named Alan Severance — almost amusingly revered, as if celebrity immunologists are nothing out of the ordinary — who struggles, as Berryman did, to reconcile his acclaimed professional life with his identity as a debilitated alcoholic. From his room at rehab, Alan sees the spires of the college campus where he teaches: “Towers above the trees across the river reminded him he was University Professor Severance not the craven drunk Alan S who had been told by an orderly that his room smelled like a farmyard.” At rehab, Severance is constantly reaching for the part of himself capable of something besides self-concern: “His own hope was to forget about himself and think about the others.” The novel is all about the world of rehab — its linoleum floors, cafeteria food and daily mundanity — but it’s ultimately about these others, and what it might mean to think about them. A woman named Arabella tells the group that she hasn’t wanted to do anything but scream for years. “You don’t remember a time when you didn’t have it?” her counselor asks, and she replies, “Drinking sends it away.” The core question of “Recovery” is whether something else might send it away instead. Perhaps other people might. This had been Berryman’s hope in life as well. “In hospitals he found his society,” his friend Saul Bellow wrote about Berryman’s stints in rehab. “About these passioning countrymen he did not need to be ironical.” In the spring of 1971, during his last sustained bout of sobriety, Berryman taught a course at the University of Minnesota called “The Post-Novel: Fiction as Wisdom-work.” This was what he was trying in “Recovery,” as well: something like wisdom-work. But by that fall, Berryman had given up on “Recovery” entirely. He left the novel unfinished, and it wasn’t published until after his death. He left only yellow notecards suggesting the possible endings he’d imagined. “END OF NOVEL,” he wrote on one. “TURN THIS CARD OVER.” On the back, he wrote: “He might, certainly, at any time drink again. But it didn’t seem likely. He felt — calm.” On an alternate card labeled “LAST PAGE OF BOOK,” he wrote: “On Pikes Peak, coming down. He was perfectly ready. No regrets. He was happier than he had ever been in his life before. Lucky, and he didn’t deserve it. He was very, very lucky. Bless everybody. He felt — fine.” But I suspected that part of why he couldn’t finish the book is that he didn’t feel fine. Those phrases — He felt — fine, He felt — calm — are haunted by similar phrases that appear earlier in the book, statements of feeling punctuated by the long, uncertain pause of a dash: He felt — depressed. He felt — nowhere. Berryman kept writing in the composition notebook dedicated to “Recovery” even after he gave up on the novel itself. But his final entries, from December 1971, are full of despair: “terrible continual thoughts of suicide — cowardly, cruel, wicked — beating them off. Don’t believe gun or knife; won’t.” On Jan. 7, 1972, Berryman jumped off the Washington Avenue Bridge near the University of Minnesota, where he taught for almost 20 years, and landed on the riverbank below, dead on impact. He relapsed just days before jumping, after 11 months of sobriety, his longest stretch. When I started visiting the archives of drunk authors who had gotten sober, I thought I was looking for proof of the possibilities of sober creativity. But in truth I was also looking for something much simpler: company in the struggle — not just the struggle to live without alcohol but the struggle to find a voice that didn’t depend on its thrall. In those early days of sobriety, when I first read Charles Jackson’s 1944 best seller “The Lost Weekend,” a tragicomic account of a single extended bender, I found myself torn between rooting for its antihero, an aspiring writer named Don Birnam, to get sober and wanting him to find a way to keep drinking. Reading the novel illuminated my own deep ambivalence about booze: how much relief I felt at stopping, how thirsty I still felt. Jackson’s reputation was largely based on that novel, which the director Billy Wilder turned into an Oscar-winning film the following year. The book was revolutionary for its time, in its willingness to portray alcoholism as a state of merciless dependence rather than a metaphysical state illuminated by the sepia-tones of tragic myth, as Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Faulkner, the holy trinity of modernist drunks, had done half a generation earlier. “The Lost Weekend” was a critical and commercial hit, selling almost a million copies over the course of Jackson’s lifetime. But it frustrated Jackson that its success meant his reputation became so inextricably entwined with alcoholism. For decades, Jackson wanted to write the story of his drunk hero once he’d left his lost weekends behind him. But he was perpetually stymied by that hypothetical book, tentatively titled “What Happened”; his biographer, Blake Bailey, has observed that Jackson was a master of “working on every conceivable thing but his novel.” In the months after Jackson began attending A.A. in 1953, however, he was finally able to generate about 150 pages, presenting a more stable vision of his drunk antihero. He wrote to a friend: “It’s far & away the best thing I’ve done, simpler, more honest, and, for the first time, out of myself — that is, not self-tortured or -absorbed or -eviscerated.” The novel was anchored in the ordinary texture of a sober alcoholic’s daily experience. “I can put it best,” Jackson told his editor, Roger Straus, “by saying that the story happens, is happening — taking place, like daily living — on every page.” Jackson wanted to believe his novel could be wondrous in its attention to ordinary human life. But he was also worried. In letters to friends, he openly confessed his anxiety that this approach could seem marked by a “total lack of originality” — the very lack of originality that A.A. was teaching him to embrace. How could he write a novel that would succeed according to the very different standards set by the spheres of literature and recovery? Jackson never finished “What Happened.” When I finally read the unpublished manuscript at his archives in New Hampshire, I brought so much desire with me — to see the fruits of his sober creativity, to see proof that sober creativity was possible — but found only pages of turgid, convoluted narrative. “I can only write the human, meanderingly,” Jackson had written to a friend, confessing his fears about his long-awaited epic, and reading his pages I started to understand what he meant. I’d been glued to “The Lost Weekend,” unable to put it down, and I wanted “What Happened” to be like that, but it wasn’t. Mostly, it was hopelessly abstract: What life means, it came to him (or he seemed to overhear it), it means all the time, not just at isolated dramatic moments that never happened. If life means anything at all, it means whatever it means every hour, every minute, through any episode big or small, if only one has the awareness to sense it ... each step, the dramatic and the humdrum alike — every fleeting second of the way. The thing was, I actually agreed with what Jackson was saying. I’d come to believe that life happened every hour, every minute; that it wasn’t made of dramatic climaxes so much as quiet effort and continuous presence. But I could also see how Jackson’s desperate desire to deploy his recovery wisdom had crippled his story. His own words about the book now played back to me like an omen: “with scarcely any ‘plot’ but much character. ... I’m proud to be so objective & detached, finally.” The manuscript bore out some of my worst fears about sobriety: that it was destined to force you into a state of plotless tedium, a string of empty evenings, a life lit by the sallow fluorescence of church-basement bromides rather than the glow of dive-bar-neon escapades. I was afraid that loving the drunk story best meant some part of me still wanted to keep living it. And of course, some part of me did. Nine months into my second sobriety — the sobriety I’m still inside of, seven years and counting — I stopped going to meetings and found myself wanting deeply to drink. I’d just moved back to the New England college town where I’d spent several years drinking heavily, and all the old bars made me nostalgic. I remembered their crushed peanut shells and vodka specials, the sweet blur of that nightly surrender. The shimmering alternate world in which I decided to drink again grew close once more. It lay just beyond the drudgework of recanting: I know I said I was an alcoholic and then took it back and said I wasn’t really and then took that back and said I actually was but the thing is I’m really not, I promise. Then I’d be back in the sweet autumnal swirl of red wine and hard cider, the chilled salt slide of dirty martinis. It would be like finally crawling back under the covers on a cold morning. That’s when I found “Infinite Jest.” David Foster Wallace’s novel didn’t exactly lead me back to meetings, though I did return to them, but it helped me understand why I needed them. More specific, it helped me understand that certain things about meetings could drive me crazy and that I could still need them. The novel had metabolized recovery with so much rigor that it had already asked all my questions and weathered all my intellectual discomforts. It documented what Wallace called the “grudging move toward maybe acknowledging that this unromantic, unhip, clichéd A.A. thing — so unlikely and unpromising ... this goofy slapdash anarchic system of low-rent gatherings and corny slogans and saccharine grins and hideous coffee” might actually offer hope, in its simplicity and its slogans, in its church-basement coffee and its effusion of anonymous and unqualified love. While Berryman and Jackson understood the project of writing sobriety in terms of deprivation — denying themselves the luxuries of plot and stylistic adornment, eschewing the momentous for the plain-spoken — Wallace wrote recovery with an exuberant excess. “Infinite Jest” is full of humor and wild imagination — giant feral hamsters roaming the land, Québécois-separatist assassins in wheelchairs — and its vision of recovery is similarly full of earnest absurdity: grown men crawling across cheap carpeting with teddy bears tucked into the crooks of their arms, sober folk struggling with “pastry dependence” or a man in rehab killing alley cats to get a sense of “resolution.” “Serious AAs look like these weird combinations of Gandhi and Mr. Rogers,” the novel observes, “with tattoos and enlarged livers and no teeth.” If I’d read “The Lost Weekend” rooting for Don Birnam to get drunk again, I read “Infinite Jest” rooting for Don Gately — one of Wallace’s protagonists, a beleaguered halfway-house counselor — to stay sober. Gately describes the newly sober as “so desperate to escape their own interior” that they want “to lay responsibility for themselves at the feet of something as seductive and consuming as their former friend the Substance.” I wanted to lay myself at the feet of the book that told me that. Wallace himself went to a Boston rehab called Granada House in late 1989, seven years before “Infinite Jest” was published and nearly 20 years before his suicide in 2008. In his 2012 biography of Wallace, “Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story,” D.T. Max argues that Wallace quickly understood the ways that recovery was also a “literary opportunity.” He credits recovery as part of Wallace’s growing commitment to “single-entendre writing, writing that meant what it said.” Recovery shifted Wallace’s whole notion of what writing could do, what purpose it might serve — made him want to dramatize the saving alchemy of community, the transformative force of outward-facing attention, the possibilities of simplicity as an alternative to the clever alibis of complexity. (The rehab staff, he wrote in an anonymous online testimonial often attributed to him, recognized his “meaningless intellectualization as a way of evading terrible truths.”) I’d been so afraid of sobriety as a flatline, as Jackson had been afraid of sobriety as a flatline, as Berryman and Johnson and maybe the older waitress sitting at the Tuesday-morning meeting had been afraid of sobriety as a flatline. I’d been afraid that meetings were basically lobotomies served alongside coffee-flavored water and Chips Ahoy!; afraid that even if sobriety could offer stability and sincerity and maybe even salvation, it could never be a story. But “Infinite Jest” knew better. It wasn’t that the novel’s brilliance survived the deadening force of sobriety. Its brilliance depended on what sobriety had wrought. Three years after I got sober, I found myself teaching Denis Johnson’s stories to a classroom of college students in Connecticut: another circle of chairs full of people listening to tales of drugged-out misadventure. My students seemed unspeakably cool — they spent their weekends finding their spirit animals and doing drugs I’d never heard of — and I was desperate to earn their affection. On the first day of class, I brought two dozen doughnuts and a cardboard box of coffee, and then I kept bringing them each week, afraid that if I stopped, the students would be disappointed. When we read Johnson’s stories about barflies and hallucinated visions, I could see myself a decade earlier, convinced that these fever dreams had a monopoly on creative brilliance, these farmhouses full of pharmaceutical opium and outdoor movie screens lit by the gigantic faces of angels. I asked the class if they had a favorite story from the collection. “Don’t worry,” I said. “There’s no right answer.” But I was lying. There was a right answer. Their favorite story was supposed to be my favorite story, which was now “Beverly Home” — the only one about recovery. Johnson’s protagonist is finally sober and working at a rehabilitation center for the elderly and disabled, where he spends his days walking the O-shaped circuit of its lobby with the patients: “All these weirdos, and me getting a little better every day right in the midst of them,” he says. “I had never known, never even imagined for a heartbeat, that there might be a place for people like us.” I read that line, the closing line of the story, aloud to my students. I read it — once, twice, three times — while they quietly swept up their doughnut crumbs. There might be a place for people like us. Every voice I’d ever heard in meetings echoed in that closing line. Maybe some of my students found it sappy or maudlin, that sense of belonging, but my heart swelled righteously against their imagined accusations. The story believed in something besides the self-immolating antics of dysfunction — their flickering, intoxicating glow. It was gazing somewhere beyond the horizon, past the blaze. Johnson, who died last year, first tried to dry out in 1978, in his parents’ home in Tucson, where he was living with his eccentric grandmother Mimi, but he didn’t get sober for good until the early 1980s. “I was addicted to everything,” he said decades later. “Now I just drink a lot of coffee.” At first Johnson was “concerned about getting sober,” and knew this was “typical of people who feel artistic.” But he wrote only two stories and a few dozen poems in 10 years while he was actively using, so he figured he didn’t have much to lose. In the first decade after he got sober, he produced four novels, two collections of poetry, a collection of stories and a screenplay. His was the arc I’d been looking for: the possibility of sobriety as jet fuel. In his archives, I found a letter a younger writer sent him in 1996: “I want to thank you for your unfailing support and friendship in helping me get acquainted with my alcoholism. It seems there are two kinds of American writers. Those who drink, and those who used to. You introduced me to the latter. Thanks, brother.” In an early draft of “Beverly Home,” Johnson wrote: “Approval was something I craved more than drugs or alcohol, and I hadn’t been able to get it in the bars, but it seemed attainable in the rooms.” He meant the rooms of recovery. That early draft shows his ragged, stuttering attempt to articulate that transformation: I had sobered up just in time to have a nervous breakdown. I had no ide I had I was a wi a whimpering dog inside. nothing more than that. In a 1965 book review for The New York Times, Charles Jackson wondered about the myth of the tormented artist: “Are we really all that tormented? Or is it something we hang onto, foster, even cherish?” During days spent in the archives and during the midnight hours of my own attempts to write, it was liberating to start questioning the ways I’d understood torment as a prerequisite to beauty. It was liberating to start imagining that there could be meaningful stories told about wreckage, sure, but also meaningful stories told about what it might mean to pull yourself out from under it: stories about showing up for work, for intimacy, for other people; stories about getting through ordinary days without drinking enough vodka to forget yourself entirely. The lie wasn’t that addiction could yield truth. The lie was that addiction had a monopoly on it. An earlier version of this article incorrectly states that D.T. Max attributed an anonymous testimonial to David Foster Wallace. Though other writers have made this attribution, Max has not.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Does a Stronger Xi Mean a Weaker Chinese Communist Party?,"Op-Ed Contributor ANN ARBOR, Mich. — This week’s announcement that term limits for China’s president and vice president would be lifted may have been arresting, but it hardly was surprising: Since Xi Jinping acceded to the presidency in 2013, he has concentrated more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Analysts soon warned that allowing Mr. Xi to keep his position beyond 2023, when his second five-year term ends, could make him more authoritarian. But this would certainly make him more authoritative, and so arguably better able to steer China’s vast bureaucracy through the major challenges ahead. The change will strengthen Mr. Xi’s influence in China and the country’s influence in the world. On the other hand, for nearly three decades, term limits have served as a formal mechanism for transferring power within the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) — an effective way of regulating the jockeying among political elites and a safety valve in the case of popular discontent. Lifting those limits introduces new unpredictability in a system that abhors uncertainty. What makes Mr. Xi stronger today could make the C.C.P. weaker tomorrow. For now, extending Mr. Xi’s tenure will ensure some measure of predictability in one way, at least: by allowing for more resolute policymaking. Mr. Xi’s crushing anticorruption campaign has already purged many potential dissenters among his political competitors, members of the military brass and wealthy entrepreneurs. And Wang Qishan, Mr. Xi’s so-called anticorruption czar, is expected to be named vice president soon. Much of China’s intellectual elite has also been cowed by an unrelenting campaign of ideological purification in academia and of censorship in mainstream news and on social media. China faces major economic, demographic and environmental challenges, which will require shifting the country’s development model away from low-cost, labor-intensive production toward a more innovative and environmentally sustainable model — this, even as the work force ages and shrinks. The country needs a strong leader to guide it through this transition. The consolidation of Mr. Xi’s power may also bolster China’s growing confidence on the international stage, perhaps even its assertiveness. This prospect raises some concerns, including — to take just one example — that the Chinese government may push back against any hardball moves by the Trump administration over trade issues, or that it will manipulate divisions between the globalists and the economic nationalists in Washington. Yet Mr. Xi’s indefinite tenure at home presents one advantage for governments abroad: a steady direction and clear messaging. When Mr. Xi speaks, one knows to listen. What is less clear, however, is the longer term impact on the C.C.P., which has ruled China since 1949, partly by deftly institutionalizing the peaceful transfer of power at the top. Term limits were introduced in the 1982 Constitution, partly in response to the destabilizing effects of what the C.C.P. had come to see as the excesses of Mao’s rule, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. Since then, two presidents have stepped down after their second five-year stints. This shift from the rule of a man to the rule of the party has been credited with bringing political stability and economic development to China. Few authoritarian regimes have established means of tidily transferring power from one leader to the next (except for monarchies, which often rely on heredity). This is one reason that when autocrats, especially long-serving ones, exit the stage, they often do so under duress or by force: Think of Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya in 2011 or, more recently, Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. Until that moment comes, as much political science research has shown, authoritarian leaders often have to fend off two major threats to their longevity: competition from would-be successors and popular discontent. Removing formal limits on office terms tends to exacerbate both of these problems. China, of course, is no garden-variety dictatorship. It is a single-party regime, with the C.C.P. entrenched at every level of government, in most social organizations and increasingly even in private firms, including foreign ones. At its apex sits a group of leaders who rule collectively and consensually under a president long regarded as the first among equals. But since becoming head of the C.C.P. in 2012, Mr. Xi has dismantled practices that spread out power and has amassed power for himself. He has adeptly leveraged the party’s record of achievements in recent decades, exploiting it to build a cult around his personality. He has justified this as a necessary step in realizing the Chinese Dream, a nationalistic project to build a Strong China, a Civilized China, a Harmonious China and a Beautiful China. The country is no longer biding its time on the world stage; it is asking for its due. And as the architect of this vision, it is Mr. Xi, not the C.C.P., who exemplifies the country’s rejuvenation. But now, Mr. Xi’s move to entrench himself as president, perhaps for life, risks undermining the norms and mechanisms developed by the C.C.P. that have brought China — and Mr. Xi himself — this far. Lifting term limits removes incentives for would-be leaders to bide their time and wait out Mr. Xi’s tenure, particularly if they are associated with a political faction other than his. The rules of the game have also become more unpredictable. Will Mr. Xi retire after three terms? Four? Or never? With no clear successor in line, any sudden need to transfer power also becomes more fraught. Who will replace him if he falls ill or dies? Especially in undemocratic systems, scheduled leadership changes can also placate the people, by allowing a new leader to adjust policies in order to correct a predecessor’s mistakes or overreach. The Jiang Zemin administration in the 1990s and early 2000s was known for its decisive economic policymaking, the restructuring of state firms and large-scale layoffs — as well as unhappiness among vast swathes of the population, especially urban workers who for decades had toiled in state firms. But then came President Hu Jintao, with an agenda promising to reduce inequality and expand social protection. (How much it actually did that is another matter.) Term limits in China are a formal mechanism of self-correction that differs from the “throw the bums out” promise inherent in democratic elections. Yet they are a device that over the years has allowed the Chinese government to control elite jockeying and popular expectations, two challenges that tend to be very tricky for authoritarian regimes to manage. Mr. Xi’s indefinite term threatens the return to one-man rule, at the cost of one-party rule. The C.C.P. has largely gone along with his power grab, hoping he can steer China through its next big challenges, but in doing so the party is risking its own survival.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | Donald Calls Vladimir: The Transcript,"Bret Stephens President Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and, against the advice of national security advisers, congratulated the Russian president on his re-election to a fourth term. The New York Times has obtained a transcript of the call, published below: The President: Pozdravlyayu! President Putin: Spasibo, Donald. The President: What’s your secret? President Putin: No secret, Donald. My people love me. I win 77 percent of vote. The President: You know, I also won 77 percent of the vote, if you don’t count all the illegal Mexicans who voted for Hillary. Plus the gays and blacks. How’d you do it? President Putin: I arranged for my only serious political adversary, Aleksei Navalny, to be convicted on trumped-up charges of embezzlement so he would be banned from running against me. The President: Love that. It’s like, “Lock her up,” Russia-style. President Putin: Yes, though you should be careful to disguise your most outrageous acts in clothing of scrupulous legality and strict bureaucratic procedure. That way masses think everything is correct and nothing is political. Like you did with this man, McCabe. Very well played, if I may say. The President: What a loser! I went after him because he was Comey’s boy and his wife’s in Hillary’s pocket. Next thing I know, it turns out he isn’t such an angel and maybe he did lie to the investigators. I didn’t see it coming but like I always say, I’ve got great instincts. President Putin: You must continue this, Donald. After Comey and McCabe it is essential to gain total control of security services. The President: I’ve already got great security. President Putin: No, Donald, security services, not bodyguard. Anyway, you are making excellent progress. First, you generate climate of opinion that all previously legitimate and venerated institutions of state are actually illegitimate and oppressive — “deep state,” as your friends call it. Second, you pretend you are deep state’s victim even though you are master. Third, you create atmosphere of fear so that your lieutenants are afraid they might lose their jobs at any moment if they don’t fulfill your wishes. I see you have done this very shrewdly with Mr. Sessions. Finally, you drive away honorable and qualified people from government so that only ones left are mediocrities and lowlifes. They will do your bidding much more readily. Well done, Donald! The President: You have the best words, Vladimir. President Putin: Natürlich. But I think you must get better control over your news media. The President: I’m doing my best. Do you get Fox News in Moscow? I mean, those guys love me. President Putin: Use your power over access to create lackeys and mouthpieces. Like this man, Hannity. The President: Oh, Sean, he’s great. President Putin: He is what Russians call Vyperdysh. I cannot explain meaning of this word. But to lead fools you must not permit yourself to be taken in by their foolishness. The President: Say that again? President Putin: Donald, like with security services, same with news media. You have caused revolution in legitimacy. All that was previously trustworthy and reputable is now disreputable and untrustworthy, and vice versa. You promote crazy conspiracy theory and shift burden of proof to your adversaries. You replace honesty with authenticity and policy with drama and reality with manufactured reality. These are correct moves. But you can go further. To enthrone yourself you must completely dethrone truth, facts, proportion and objectivity. This is how I became president-for-life. The President: Well, I’ve been doing it. You know: “FAKE NEWS!” President Putin: We believe your most brilliant tactic is when you bait media into nonstop hysteria over your deliberately stupid Twitter comments so that journalists chase ghosts, people stop reacting and nobody sees your true intention. Bury signal in noise: Very clever! The President: I do that? Great! President Putin: If I may switch subject, Donald, I want to speak of sanctions. The President: You know we did the absolute minimum, Vladimir. Congress forced my hand on this one. President Putin: To be honest, we don’t mind these new sanctions. They are too weak to hurt us, but they feed Russian complex about Western persecution, very useful to me. But we are unfairly hurt by multilateral sanctions by you and the Europeans on our banks and energy companies imposed on account of Ukrainian misunderstanding. The President: Vladimir, you know I’m a dealmaker, but that’s a hard sell. President Putin: We are prepared to be extremely reasonable, Donald. For example, we will consider enforcing sanctions on North Korea if you ease sanctions on us. And perhaps we will not sell defensive arms to Tehran if you halt your sale of defensive arms to Kiev. What do you think? The President: We need a summit, Vladimir. In Mar-a-Lago! I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. President Putin: For my part, Donald, it is hardly the beginning.",The New York Times
2018,Donald Glover Publishes Spoof ‘Deadpool’ Script After Exiting Series,"Until last week, the comedian and television creator Donald Glover was working on an animated series for FX about the Marvel superhero Deadpool, a violent mercenary character known for his wisecracks and toilet humor. By this week, the project had been canceled and Mr. Glover was on Twitter publicly raising more questions about what led to his departure from the show. The project, planned as a 10-episode run for the FXX channel and announced in May, was to have been a collaboration with Mr. Glover’s brother Stephen, another pairing of the siblings behind the show “Atlanta,” which airs on FX. (FXX is FX’s sister channel, and both are owned by 21st Century Fox.) But on Saturday, FX, citing “creative differences,” announced that the project had been canceled. Its statement said the Glovers had agreed to part ways with the network and with Marvel television. In an article about the announcement, Variety said the show “may have been a casualty of Donald Glover’s packed schedule.” Mr. Glover, who also releases music under the name Childish Gambino, disputed that characterization in a tweet thread on Wednesday: “For the record: I wasn’t too busy to work on ‘Deadpool,’” he said. He then posted pages of a script that used the Deadpool character — who is known for speaking to readers or moviegoers directly — to think through the cancellation. In the script, which is filled with pop culture references, including several that allude to events from the last few days, Deadpool considers whether racism was a factor in the cancellation and remarks upon specific scripts that may have alienated the Glovers’ collaborators. Mr. Glover’s tweet thread was a remarkable way to shed a light upon industry drama that does not often reach social media, a public statement in the form of a puzzle in the form of a script that both confounded and intrigued his fans. The actor had recently given an interview to The New Yorker in which he commented extensively on his relationship with FX while working on “Atlanta,” a critically acclaimed show that has won two Golden Globes and two Emmys. In it, he suggested that the network did not understand the show’s characters and that he had to mislead the network to get his vision on the air. But John Solberg, a network spokesman for FX, said that no one at the network had taken issue with those comments and that the unraveling of the Deadpool project had nothing to do with the interview. He said that the network had supported the brothers’’s vision for the show but that Marvel owned the intellectual property rights to the Deadpool character and had decided to go a different way. He also emphasized that there was no acrimony between FX and Marvel, and said that creative differences often led to projects falling apart. The 14-page script Mr. Glover posted to Twitter was labeled if it were the series finale of the canceled show. Halfway through the story, Deadpool, who seems throughout as if he may be speaking for Mr. Glover, addresses the show’s cancellation directly. “You know, I’m not mad about this whole ‘canceled thing,’” the script reads. “I actually think it’s a good thing. I mean, is it even a good time to have a violent, gun loving white man ranting on TV?” There is a brief pause, and the script continues: “Other than the PRESIDENT!” Deadpool then considers the factors that may have led to the show’s cancellation. He wonders whether it could have been canceled because of racism. He then begins to mention what may have been specific episodes written by the Glovers, including one about goat yoga (a real thing), another that included the singer Taylor Swift, and a third in which a character makes a rude joke about people who buy Marvel toys. Marvel declined to comment. Mr. Glover did not respond to emails. The script, which says it was written by Mr. Glover, includes several references to recent news events: jokes about the rise of bitcoin and Facebook’s recent privacy scandal, as well as digs at Ben Carson and President Trump. It takes mild shots at the rappers Rich the Kid and 6ix9ine. (A recurring gag is that the characters to whom Deadpool is speaking do not understand his references to black culture.) Deadpool also refers to the police killing of Stephon Clark in Sacramento this month and to a GQ magazine article published Monday that related a story about an anonymous female celebrity said to have bitten Beyoncé. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Donald Glover’s brother and collaborator. He is Stephen Glover, not Steven.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Donald Trump Gets a Lesson From That ‘Very Bad Judge’,"Editorial As 280-character brain-squirts from America’s thumbiest commander in chief go, the one President Trump emitted late Tuesday night appeared harmless enough. Earlier in the day, a Federal District Court judge in San Diego handed Mr. Trump a victory in his efforts to build a wall along the nation’s southern border. In a detailed 101-page opinion, the judge rejected a challenge by the State of California and several environmental groups to the administration’s waiver of environmental laws that could have held up the wall’s construction. “Big legal win today,” Mr. Trump tweeted around 11:30. “U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!” So far so good. Mr. Trump is entitled, no less than other presidents, to celebrate his administration’s victories in court — even if he does so in a bathrobe. What he failed to mention, though, was the name of the judge who issued the ruling: Gonzalo Curiel, of the Southern District of California. Judge Curiel, you may recall, was on Mr. Trump’s radar in May 2016, soon after Mr. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for president. At the time, Judge Curiel was presiding over a long-running class-action lawsuit against Trump University, which had been accused of defrauding customers who spent $1,500 for three-day seminars that promised to reveal Mr. Trump’s real estate secrets. Mr. Trump, who refuses to be held to account for anything he has ever said or done, was irked that a federal judge would dare to entertain litigation against him. At a rally in San Diego, Mr. Trump called Judge Curiel “very hostile,” “a very bad judge” and a “hater of Donald Trump,” and said he “should be ashamed of himself. I think it’s a disgrace that he’s doing this.” He added that Judge Curiel “happens to be, we believe, Mexican.” Not true: Judge Curiel was born and raised in Indiana. But the implication, of course, was that Mr. Trump, who had begun his own candidacy with derogatory comments about Mexicans and had been pushing a border wall with Mexico throughout the campaign, could not get a fair trial from a “Mexican” judge. Less than two years later, in a case involving the border wall itself, that same judge ruled in Mr. Trump’s favor. He is no longer a “very bad judge,” apparently. It’s possible that Mr. Trump simply forgot who Judge Curiel is. More likely, he knows full well and doesn’t care. What he cares about is protecting his delicate ego, and repairing any damage to it inflicted by people who don’t show a sufficient degree of respect or self-abasement. This all-consuming self-interest leads him to change his opinion of people and institutions, depending on how he thinks they are treating him at that moment. Laws and norms, ethics and principles? Meaningless concepts. In Mr. Trump’s world, nothing is sacred and everything is transactional. This is a man who is so much more interested in winning than in governing that he filed for re-election the same day he was inaugurated. It’s the core of who he is, as almost anyone who has had even a glancing dealing with him over the years — especially in real estate, where nothing matters but the sale — will attest. If you help him or say nice things about him, you’re the best. If you get in his way or criticize him, you’re unfair, dishonest, terrible. Failing, even. Ask “Liddle” Bob Corker, the Tennessee senator who earned Mr. Trump’s outrage by criticizing the Republican tax bill, then seemed to get back on the president’s good side with a few empathetic words. Or Senator John McCain, who is dealing with terminal brain cancer even as Mr. Trump keeps mocking him for his vote last year against repealing Obamacare. Or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was Mr. Trump’s first and most ardent supporter in the Senate, but who has secured a spot in the president’s doghouse after recusing himself from the Russia investigation. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump fired yet another broadside at Mr. Sessions, complaining that his failure to investigate alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is “disgraceful” — in all caps, naturally. None of this is remotely surprising anymore, but even so, Mr. Trump’s tweet about Judge Curiel’s border-wall decision revealed once again the depths of the president’s own self-interest and his utter lack of principles. When this is the driving force of the commander in chief, and it is aimed at our governmental and social institutions, it is profoundly destructive. Shortly after the 2016 rally where he disparaged the competence, integrity and ethnicity of Judge Curiel, Mr. Trump was asked why he did not just settle the Trump University case and be done with it. After predicting that he would win outright, he said: “I could settle that case. … I don’t want to settle the case. Because you know what? Because I’m a man of principle.” (In November 2016, days after he won the election, Mr. Trump settled, eventually paying $25 million.) Fortunately, as this tale reveals, there are in fact still people of principle in public service, and they’re doing important work every day to preserve our institutions and counteract this president’s worst impulses. Judge Curiel, for one, has continued to do his job, carefully applying the law to the cases that come before him, no matter how obnoxious the litigants might be. In his ruling on Tuesday, the judge acknowledged the “heated political debate” surrounding the border wall, and quoted a passage on the role of courts by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. — who, he slyly noted, is a “fellow Indiana native”: “Courts are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our nation’s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.” That is what being a public servant in America sounds like, and it requires a level of selflessness and devotion to democratic ideals that is alien to Mr. Trump.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Donald Trump Sure Has a Problem With Democracy,"Editorial Though George Washington was elected unanimously, he was always a reluctant president. He pursued a second term in 1792 only at the urging of his cabinet, and in 1796, when he insisted it was time to step down, he famously warned that not to do so risked a return to the very tyranny Americans had fought to overthrow. “The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create whatever the form of government, a real despotism,” Washington wrote in what’s become known as his Farewell Address. “A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position.” In the years since, millions of Americans have put their lives on the line to protect against the despotism that Washington warned about. In World War II, Americans sacrificed their lives and lost their loved ones to defeat dictators in Germany, Italy and Japan. For nearly the rest of the 20th century, the United States led the free world to preserve democratic ideals against the Soviet Union’s push for Communism. That’s a proud history, and it hasn’t been much of a challenge until recently for American presidents to extol it — the wisest of them mindful of how far short of its ideals the United States has at times fallen, even as it has tried to guide other nations toward democracy as the surest safeguard of human rights, peace and opportunity. But President Trump just doesn’t get it. There’s something in the man that impels him reflexively to celebrate the authoritarian model. At a Republican fund-raiser, in remarks reported by CNN, Mr. Trump lavished praise on President Xi Jinping of China, who recently consolidated his power and moved to change the rules so he could effectively become “emperor for life.” “He’s now president for life. President for life. No, he’s great,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi to the Republican donors, at a luncheon at Mar-a-Lago. Then he went on seemingly to express interest in doing the same thing in the United States so that he, too, could rule forever. “And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll have to give that a shot some day.” Mr. Trump was surely joking about becoming president for life himself. But there can be little doubt now that he truly sees no danger in Mr. Xi’s “great” decision to extend his own rule until death. That craven reaction is in line with Mr. Trump’s consistent support and even admiration for men ruling with increasingly brutal and autocratic methods — Vladimir Putin of Russia, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, to name a few. The perspective is very different in Europe, where leaders, shaken by Mr. Trump’s election, initially hoped Mr. Xi would help defend a global system based on democracy and rule of law but now fear he, too, is becoming a threat. Mr. Trump certainly needs to find ways to work with Mr. Xi on major international challenges. But past presidents have combined efforts to deepen relations with China with advocacy for expanding human rights there. Mr. Trump clearly sees no national interest or responsibility in trying to promote democracy. On the way to amassing more power for himself, Mr. Xi has moved to crush all rivals, silence all dissent, undermine Chinese institutions, promote a cult of personality, weaken the free market economy, destroy any hint of an independent press and otherwise tighten control over a society that is already among the world’s most restricted. As for Mr. Trump’s line about becoming president for life: His audience was said to respond with laughter, and let’s hope it was nervous laughter. They and we have reason for anxiety. It’s not too much to say that as the authoritarian model gathers strength abroad, democracy is under assault at home. The Russian government meddled in the 2016 election to help elect Mr. Trump, and American intelligence agencies have said they anticipate further Russian interference in the midterms this year. Mr. Trump has remained strangely indifferent to this meddling. He has also proved ignorant of and impatient with checks on presidential power, whether they be courts that thwart his unconstitutional actions or a Justice Department that won’t jump to his orders to investigate political rivals. When you consider that Mr. Trump lost the popular vote by almost three million ballots, claiming the presidency only through the antidemocratic mechanics of the Electoral College — not to mention with some help from Russia — it may be understandable that he would be uncomfortable with democracy. Ultimately it will be up to the American voter, in 2018 and then 2020, to fulfill Mr. Washington’s hopes for the resilience of the American system.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Donald Trump and North Korea: What a Fine Mess,"Editorial In a case of diplomatic whiplash, President Trump has gone, in short order, from ridiculing North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and threatening to destroy his country, to accepting Mr. Kim’s invitation for a face-to-face meeting within two months, the first between leaders of the two countries. We have long encouraged Mr. Trump to pursue negotiations to resolve the danger of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, rather than threatening war, and the United States should make the most of this opportunity. And this is the rare time in which he is upending Republican politics in a sensible, not disastrous, way. Talking to our global adversaries, rather than playing tough with them, has been anathema to the party for years. Mr. Trump, though, is following in the footsteps of the Republicans’ favorite demon, President Barack Obama, who was criticized for negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump has decided that such talks can be in the country’s best interests. But the precipitous way in which Mr. Trump agreed to the invitation, and the fact that this mercurial president, ill informed and ill prepared on complex national security issues, will be across the table from Mr. Kim is worrisome. As proposed under the invitation formally conveyed at the White House on Thursday by South Korean officials who had met Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump would have only several weeks to prepare. Mr. Kim and his government, with a foreign minister and several vice ministers expert on the United States, have been plotting their diplomatic initiatives, including a charm offensive at the Olympics in South Korea and a conciliatory New Year’s speech, for months. He has been sending signals his nuclear program is advanced enough that he can turn his attention to his economy. Mr. Trump’s administration, meanwhile, has done virtually nothing to prepare for talks, having been focused on tightening sanctions against the North and planning for war. There’s been little coordination between the White House and the State Department, which has been gutted and marginalized under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. What’s more, the chief envoy to North Korea just retired, and there is no ambassador to South Korea, leaving the administration with few experts capable of steering the complex portfolio. Maybe such an unorthodox summit meeting between two leaders with a flair for the dramatic will be hugely successful; it could also collapse in failure, making it a very high-stakes gamble for Mr. Trump. The North Koreans have been seeking a meeting with an American president for decades, yet Mr. Trump agreed to one without getting anything in return. And it didn’t take long for the chaos and mixed messaging that has long characterized Trump policy to resurface Friday when Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, seemed to back away from the summit meeting, insisting it wouldn’t take place unless North Korea first took concrete steps toward denuclearization. Of course, that didn’t last. Later, a White House official told The Wall Street Journal, “The invitation has been extended and accepted, and that stands.” The planned session builds on an agreement, announced this week, for the United States and North Korea to hold their first sustained direct talks in many years. After a period of aggressively testing nuclear devices and missiles, Mr. Kim opened the door to talks by promising to discuss ending his nuclear program if America guarantees the North’s security. He agreed to suspend nuclear and missile tests during the talks and not to object when the United States and South Korea hold military exercises this spring. Many assumed the next step would be preparatory talks in which experts from each side would test the other’s intentions and then enter into lengthy formal negotiations. What happens now is anybody’s guess. A White House official provided Trumpian bluster on Thursday, saying that “we’re not even talking about negotiations” but rather a meeting between Mr. Trump, who “made his reputation on making deals,” and an authoritarian North Korean leader who has the power to make decisions and therefore avoid the “long slog of the past” negotiations. But the long slog of negotiations has a purpose, allowing the two sides to stake out positions, sometimes in public, then horse-trade privately as they search for a mutually acceptable bottom line. There is reason summit meetings are usually saved for the end, when leaders can give the last push to make a deal happen. Let’s hope that responsible American officials are not approaching the talks with a serious belief in the skills of a businessman whose impetuousness helped lead to several bankruptcies and who revealed sensitive intelligence secrets to Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting. On Twitter, Mr. Trump seemed optimistic that North Korea’s promise to discuss denuclearization means the North actually would abandon the nuclear program, which includes more than 20 nuclear warheads, an arsenal of missiles and facilities for producing nuclear fuel with both enriched uranium and plutonium. Many experts doubt Mr. Kim will ever give up his nuclear weapons, and one question is whether Mr. Trump could ever accept a compromise, as Mr. Obama did with the Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Trump is threatening to renege on. Starting in 1994, during Bill Clinton’s presidency, North Korea froze its plutonium program for eight years in return for heavy fuel oil, but that was before it had nuclear weapons. Both Pyongyang and the George W. Bush administration contributed to the deal’s collapse. So far, Mr. Trump is insisting his “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctioning and isolating North Korea will continue, and there is no indication of what, if anything, he might be willing to give North Korea if it limits the nuclear program in a verifiable way. Pyongyang’s oft-stated demands include an end to sanctions, the removal of American troops from South Korea and the replacement of the Korean War armistice with a formal peace treaty. Some have argued that Mr. Trump shouldn’t meet Mr. Kim because doing so validates a ruthless ruler. The problem is not so much meeting with adversaries but what you do with that encounter. Mr. Trump has a lot of serious work to do before that day comes.",The New York Times
2018,"Donald Trump, Austin, Snowstorm: Your Wednesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Against aides’ advice, President Trump congratulated Vladimir Putin on Tuesday for his victory in the Russian presidential election. The White House said the call, made five days after the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russia, had focused on “shared interests.” They did not include election meddling or the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. Other leaders, foreign and American, have also congratulated Mr. Putin. But not the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell: “When I look at a Russian election, what I see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results. Calling him wouldn’t have been high on my list.” • Separately, Mr. Trump reinforced his commitment to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on Tuesday. • A suspect in the series of bombings that have terrorized the Texas capital died early today, blowing himself up in his vehicle as officers closed in on him, the authorities said. The suspect was a 24-year-old white man, the Austin police chief said at a predawn news conference. Officials did not rule out the possibility that the man, whom they did not identify, had accomplices. • He is believed to be involved in at least five bombs that have detonated this month in Austin and San Antonio, killing at least two people and wounding five. Here’s what we know about the bombings. • Regulators, prosecutors, politicians and investors are all asking whether the social network mishandled user data. The business model of Mark Zuckerberg’s company is under scrutiny after reports that a political consulting firm improperly obtained information on 50 million users. • The firm, Cambridge Analytica, suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, on Tuesday. • Starting today, however, 18 inches of snow could fall in New York City. Find the latest here. • Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, is the second woman this month to challenge efforts by allies of President Trump to bury stories about extramarital relationships. She is suing The National Enquirer’s parent company — whose chief executive is a friend of the president’s — which paid her $150,000 to keep quiet. • Separately on Tuesday, a ruling in a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump raised the possibility of a public airing of other accusations of sexual misconduct. • The Illinois governor’s race could become one of the most expensive in history. After winning their parties’ nominations on Tuesday, the Republican incumbent, Bruce Rauner, a private-equity executive, will face J. B. Pritzker, a Democrat and billionaire philanthropist, this fall. Here are full results from the primary. • In a congressional race that became a fight between moderate and progressive Democrats, the longtime representative Daniel Lipinski narrowly defeated a challenger from the left, Marie Newman. A Republican denounced by his party as a Nazi also won. • “If you don’t think this can happen at your school, you are sadly mistaken.” A school superintendent in Maryland had a familiar warning after a shooting left the suspect dead and two students wounded. The police said the gunman, a 17-year-old student, had been confronted by an armed deputy at Great Mills High. • The shooting occurred a little over a month after 17 people were killed at a school in Florida. A nationwide march in support of gun control is planned for this weekend. • In trade talks with Mexico and Canada, the U.S. is pushing to limit warning labels on junk food. • Lawyers for Bill O’Reilly and Fox News argued for the dismissal of the defamation lawsuit brought by three women who reached harassment settlements. Separately, a longtime analyst for Fox News, Ralph Peters, is leaving, telling colleagues that the network had become “a mere propaganda machine.” • U.S. stocks were up on Tuesday.

Each week, The Times’s crossword column, Wordplay, highlights the answer to one of the most difficult clues from the previous week’s puzzles. This week’s word: nene. If it looks like a goose and honks like a goose, it should just be a goose, right? However, the nene (pronounced nay-nay) is special. Not only is it Hawaii’s state bird, it’s also the world’s rarest goose. Its webbed feet have adapted to living on hardened lava, but it is a weak flier. Nenes were once hunted nearly to extinction, but conservation efforts have bolstered their population. Another reason to know your nenes is that, although rare in the wild, they often come up in crossword puzzles. Nene has been an entry in Times crosswords 295 times since 1944. It appeared in the puzzle on March 12 with the clue “Hawaiian goose.” The word might also appear in easy puzzles with the clue “Hawaiian state bird” or “Hawaiian honker.” Later in the week, as the crosswords become harder, it might be referred to as “Aloha State bird,” “Endangered state bird,” “Lava geese,” “Bird so-called from its call” or “Gray-brown goose.” You can find out about the nene and other birds that appear regularly in our Crossword Aviary.

2018,"Opinion | Donald Trump, Mustache Lover at Heart","Op-Ed Contributor John Bolton’s appointment as national security adviser is surprising in at least one respect. Mr. Bolton does not conform to President Trump’s well-attested preference for hiring people from “central casting” — that is, svelte women and square-jawed, clean-shaven men. Insiders report that when Mr. Trump first assembled his cabinet, he rejected Mr. Bolton for secretary of state because of his eccentric brush mustache. But central casting, in the guise of Fox News, has encouraged the president to reconsider this prejudice, and having done so, he’s unlikely to regret it. Trump may think he’s mustache-averse, but what he’s likely to realize over the course of the next few months is that this particular form of facial hair — in addition to Mr. Bolton’s established track record for bellicosity — can signal a tendency toward the sort of masculine impulsiveness and aggression that is dear to Mr. Trump’s own heart. This is not to disparage men with mustaches. They come in all varieties — and context is everything. In the realms of modern business and politics, however, facial hair has particular resonance. Beards and mustaches were effectively banished from these worlds more than a century ago. And so a man who persists in wearing a large mustache is deliberately standing out as a nonconformist. What does he reject? He rejects the longstanding shaving standard, and to some extent, its associated virtues: propriety, discipline and sociability. The reasons that mustaches were abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century are complicated, but have to do with hygiene and corporate business culture. Germs were discovered at the end of the nineteenth century, and facial hair was subsequently condemned as unsanitary and uncivilized. Just as importantly, employers rejected facial hair as a mark of indiscipline and unprofessionalism. This new shaving standard was a sharp departure from the previous century, when mustaches were ensigns of resolute and pugnacious manliness — so much so, that most European armies required their officers and recruits to muster with standard black mustaches. And so 20th-century men who cultivated their upper lips inevitably, if sometimes inadvertently, invoked this military past, with an additional element of nonconformity. This dynamic explains the edginess of the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa, the bravado of Reggie Jackson and Hulk Hogan, and the tough-guy charm of Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. The 1930s and 40s were the heyday of Hollywood mustaches. Errol Flynn, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Jr., Adolphe Menjou and Clark Gable all graced the silver screen with rapier mustaches. Even the mild-mannered Bing Crosby was briefly persuaded to try one. The responses from audiences were mixed: One the one hand, they made leading men appear more manly, free of conventional restraints. Their roguish, free-spirited independence offered a fantasy of liberated masculinity that appealed to men and women alike. But the allure of the “modern caveman,” as one critic described the newly mustachioed Clark Gable, was counteracted by an underlying sense of aggressiveness that audiences, particularly women, found unattractive. One studio studied the question, presenting test audiences with scenes featuring Tyrone Power with and without a mustache. The result was that Mr. Power appeared shaved in subsequent films. This contrast of manly types could be seen as akin to the Freudian battle between self-assertion and social control. A shaven man was perceived as a team player, disciplined and sociable. A man with facial hair, by contrast, was more impulsive and independent, playing by his own rules. It was for this reason that voters, from the 1920s onward, regarded mustachioed politicians with suspicion. If two-time presidential runner-up Thomas Dewey, whom one admirer dubbed the “Clark Gable of candidates,” had shaved his upper lip, history might have been kinder to him. In 1944, journalist Edith Efron wrote about Dewey’s mustache in The New York Times Magazine: “It fascinates. It amuses. And it repels.” His lip adornment helped Dewey achieve a reputation for toughness, but also for arrogance. After his 1948 defeat, Dewey only half-jokingly told some visiting boy scouts, “remember, fellows, any boy can become president unless he’s got a mustache.” In subsequent years, facial hair was a feature of the rebellious left. In our times, it is still nonconformist in business and politics, though today one is just as likely to find it on the political right, which has increasingly developed its own rebellious counterculture. For every Che Guevara, there is a Geraldo Rivera; for every hairy hipster, a hirsute hunter. This brings us back to Mr. Bolton, and to Mr. Trump himself. Mr. Bolton’s disregard for shaving norms is a faithful reflection of his fierce independence, and his general disdain for established political ground rules and diplomatic norms. His vitriolic language and passion for conflict prevented him from winning Senate confirmation in 2005 as ambassador to the United Nations. He is the ego in conflict with the super-ego of the political establishment: Negotiations and treaties are for wimps, and so are razors. Reporters have noted that early in his presidency, Mr. Trump felt tentative, and inclined to listen to the advice of people around him. Today he is increasingly going with his gut, and worries far less about convention or conventional looks. As he throws off the shackles on his own ego, he has turned to a similarly liberated national security adviser. Even if he still does not like Mr. Bolton’s mustache, Mr. Trump may be drawn to the pugnacious manliness it represents. In historical context, Mr. Bolton’s mustache fits perfectly for a man who follows no rules. No wonder he has vowed never to shave it off. And no wonder that, in spite of initial misgivings, the “Disruptor-in-Chief” has turned to him. Perhaps Mr. Trump will consider growing one himself some day.",The New York Times
2018,"Donald Trump, Sergei Skripal, Champions League: Your Thursday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. News consumption advice and the latest on Britain’s spy poisoning, President Trump’s metal tariffs and the Champions League. Here’s the news: • For two months, our tech columnist skipped digital news and social media, reading only newspapers, newsletters, books and magazine articles. He said he ended up better informed and less anxious, with more free time. “Most of all, I realized my personal role as a consumer of news in our broken digital news environment,” he writes. “I distilled those lessons into three short instructions, the way the writer Michael Pollan once boiled down nutrition advice: Get news. Not too quickly. Avoid social.” _____ • The British authorities confirmed that a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent in England this week. Suspicion is now rampant that the episode was an assassination attempt, and that Russia might be responsible. The former spy, Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, remain in critical condition. _____ • President Trump is expected to formally impose new tariffs on steel and aluminum today, despite a strong opposition from establishment Republicans. As aides quit in record numbers, the president increasingly relies on his own judgment. European Union officials unveiled an array of retaliatory tariffs they would place on American imports, including products made in Republican states, like Kentucky bourbon. Separately, we learned that Mr. Trump ignored his lawyers’ advice and asked key witnesses in the Russia inquiry about their conversations with investigators. _____ • Turkey asked Washington to stop Kurdish commanders from sending more troops to Afrin, the Kurdish stronghold in Syria’s west that Turkey invaded last month. Besides creating a diplomatic quandary, the Kurdish deployment to Afrin is depriving the U.S. of allied troops in the campaign to stamp out the last vestiges of the Islamic State. Meanwhile, negotiations between the Syrian government and Jaish al-Islam, the rebel group that controls diminishing parts of the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta, went nowhere. New government troops are adding momentum to the brutal siege that began in 2013. _____ • In honor of International Women’s Day, an official holiday in many countries, here are some stories on the state of gender equality: In France, the government may fine companies that do not erase gender pay gaps within three years. Some workers in Spain are striking over inequality. And in Britain, Parliament and social media debated “mansplaining.” In the U.S., a Muslim fashion blogger is making waves by challenging stereotypes about hijab-wearing women.

Enter the Hello Girls, a group of bilingual telephone operators selected for working the switchboards in France, connecting the front lines with supply depots and military command. They often handled over 150,000 calls per day. But because they were women, the U.S. government denied them veteran status for more than 60 years after the war. “The unfortunate reality is their service wasn’t officially recognized with veteran status until 1979, when a small fraction of those who served were still alive,” a senior curator at the National World War I Museum and Memorial said. “To achieve that point of hard-won recognition took a monumental effort.” Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2018,"Donald Trump, Stephen Bannon, Xi Jinping: Your Monday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Risks of a trade war, Stephen Bannon in Europe and China’s lawmakers scrap presidential term limits. Here’s the news: • U.S. trade partners are resorting to persuasion, threats, personal appeals and diplomatic leverage to jockey for exemptions from new American metal tariffs. A trade war would threaten to diminish living standards globally and risk reducing the World Trade Organization, the arbiter to such disputes, to insignificance. In the U.S., President Trump has the support of the steel industry, but others in his base are worried: Midwest farmers are concerned that retaliation could hurt their exports. Our Op-Ed columnist Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate for his research on trade, writes that “the tariffs could unwind the whole global trade system.” You can ask him your questions here. _____ • “Let them call you racists.” That was Stephen Bannon, the former chief strategist for President Trump, addressing the party congress of the National Front in Lille, France. The speech was part of a tour through Europe, in which he seeks to support the Continent’s strongmen (like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary) and populists (like Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front). Ms. Le Pen put forward “Rassemblement National” as a new name for her party, hoping to reverse its electoral setbacks. (The name can be translated as National Rally or National Gathering.) _____ • In China, the rubber-stamp legislature’s vote was almost unanimous: Presidential term limits are gone, as expected, allowing Xi Jinping, 64, to rule for life. China’s leaders appear to be discarding a lesson that their fathers drew from the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution: the danger of concentrating power in an unassailable leader. Meanwhile, President Trump’s series of erratic moves — from threats of new tariffs to an impromptu overture to North Korea — has helped cast Mr. Xi as the more stable leader in Asia. _____ • In Syria, government forces intensified their assault on the rebel-held Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta. Meanwhile, Turkish forces are said to have advanced to the outskirts of the Kurdish-controlled town of Afrin. As the Kurdish-dominated coalition shifted its fighters to battle the Turkish assault, our correspondent visited the somewhat quiet headquarters of the Syrian Democratic Forces in the town of Ainissa. There, the uneasy alliance of Kurds and Arabs, helped by U.S. forces and held together by the fight against the Islamic State, risks being tested as the Kurds consolidate their control. _____ • Educators in Britain, after decades spent in a collective effort to minimize risk for children, are now, cautiously, trying to provide it. The shift, they say, signals the end of a decades-long drift toward overprotecting children. For experts, a limited exposure to risks provides experiences that are essential to childhood development and useful in building resilience and grit. • Google is being sued by former employees who say the company is going too far with diversity.

More than 3,000 of the trees were presented as a gift by the city of Tokyo in 1912. The gesture of international good will has a rich history, but one of its more contentious episodes occurred 80 years ago: the Cherry Tree Rebellion. The trees had already become a favorite of Washingtonians by 1938, when construction was set to begin on the Jefferson Memorial. The site for the monument was along the Tidal Basin, where many of the trees had been planted. The planned removal of the trees was opposed by parts of Washington society, in particular by the city’s newspapers. A group of women even briefly chained themselves to a tree on the site in an effort to stop construction. An exasperated President Franklin D. Roosevelt dismissed the controversy — which died down soon after the memorial’s groundbreaking — as a “flimflam game” designed to sell newspapers. “If anybody wants to chain herself to the tree and the tree is in the way, we will move the tree and the lady and the chains, and transplant them to some other place,” he said.

2018,Opinion | Donald Trump: Man at War,"Charles M. Blow As Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, tweeted Friday: “@realDonaldTrump is now set for war on 3 fronts: political vs Bob Mueller, economic vs China/others on trade, and actual vs. Iran and/or North Korea. This is the most perilous moment in modern American history — and it has been largely brought about by ourselves, not by events.” I agree fully with this assessment. Some have viewed President Trump’s recent moves as a sign of rising self-assuredness in the man. I see quite the opposite. I see a man growing increasingly irascible as his sense of desperation surges. The world is closing in on Trump and he is in an existential fight for his own survival. This is precisely what makes him so dangerous: As the personal threat to him grows, his threat to the country grows. The power of the American presidency is an awesome power, and Trump will harness and deploy it all as guard and guarantee against his own demise. Add to his sense of panic his compounding emotional and psychological liabilities: He has an inflated view of his own skills, talents and expertise. He knows only a fraction of what he has convinced himself that he knows. He prefers casual conversation to literary examination, opting to listen rather than to read, which is both a sign of a severely compromised and restrained intellect and an astounding arrogance about one’s information absorption. While pundits mull whether the cloud of chaos Trump keeps swirling around him is simple incompetence or strategic plotting, The New York Times reported Friday: “Aides said there was no grand strategy to the president’s actions, and that he got up each morning this week not knowing what he would do. Much as he did as a New York businessman at Trump Tower, Mr. Trump watched television, reacted to what he saw on television and then reacted to the reaction.” This is all gut and instinct. This is all reactionary emoting by a man of poor character, one addicted to affirmation. He desperately needs to be the king-of-every-hill he sees in the mirror: He was the ladies’ man, businessman, smartest man, toughest man. There was nothing beyond him, and he didn’t have to follow the rules, he only had to follow his instincts. But Washington politics is a long way from New York City real estate. Wrangling Senate votes is a long way from prowling for playmates. This is the big leagues and this little man is feeling the stress and strain of it. Even if he can’t be good, he at least wants to look good, to fake it to try to make it. This may be one of the reasons he is inviting so many television personalities into his cabinet. This is all just window dressing. Trump is truly in the cross hairs, and he knows it. Just as he is going to war on three fronts, he is being attacked on three fronts. The Robert Mueller investigation is bearing down on him as an inevitable in-person interview with Trump — and all of its potential pitfalls — draws nearer. I have resisted predictions about what could come of the investigation because it would be little more than conjecture. Only Mueller knows what Mueller knows. But, it appears to me that the president is surely acting like a guilty man, or at least someone trying to shield another who is guilty. Then there is the porn star, the playmate and the reality star: Three women currently in litigation over sexual contact with Trump — two admittedly consensual and one allegedly not. The most tantalizing and threatening of the three is the case with porn star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Daniels and her attorney, as well as language in the nondisclosure agreement that she signed, suggests that she has some compromising written and photographic evidence about her encounters with Trump. Furthermore, in Daniels, Trump seems to have met his match as an internet troll. When someone on Twitter asked Clifford, “What snack foods do you recommend for watching you on “60 Minutes” tomorrow night? Nachos and wings feel so January, you know?” Clifford responded: “Tacos and mini corndogs just seems so right … and yet, so wrong. I believe the more traditional choice is popcorn, however.” Yes, the subtext of that tweet is exactly what you think it is. Note to self: Never pick a fight with a porn star. And now with the massive March For Our Lives, we see that going into the midterms not only are black voters and suburban white women energized against this president and his congressional protectors, so are young people who feel betrayed, particularly on the issue of gun control, by politicians beholden to the N.R.A. Trump talked big about standing up to the N.R.A., and then summarily caved to the N.R.A. If this surge of enthusiasm leads to Democrats flipping the House — and the long shot, the Senate — and something comes of the Mueller investigation or the women’s lawsuits, you can rest assured that impeachment proceedings will be in the offing. This is why Trump is going to war.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Donald Trump’s Empty Words on Trade,"Editorial Since announcing new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week, the Trump administration has argued that it is protecting American industry from China, which in recent years flooded the global market with cheap metals. It is impossible to take this argument seriously. For starters, the tariffs will have little impact on China. That country supplies less than 5 percent of the steel and about 10 percent of the aluminum that the United States imports. Further, a vast majority of metal imports from China are already subject to tariffs put into place by previous administrations, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Oddly, the primary victims of these tariffs, which are being imposed under a law that lets the president restrict trade to protect national security, will be American allies like the European Union and South Korea. Canada and Mexico will be temporarily exempted, but could still be hit with tariffs later if they and the United States fail to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Before President Trump signed orders authorizing the tariffs on Thursday, he suggested other countries could be exempted, too, but only if they treated the United States “fairly,” including by spending more money on their own defense. “Many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies as they like to call them,” he said at the White House, flanked by steel and aluminum workers and administration officers. More important, the Trump administration has repeatedly dropped the ball on efforts that might have succeeded in prompting China to curb production, something that would have benefited not just the United States but also allies that are now threatening to retaliate by imposing tariffs on American goods and services. Most experts agree that China is not moving fast enough to close steel mills and aluminum smelters that it no longer needs because its economy is growing more slowly as it has gotten much bigger. The country’s leaders fear that moving faster could hurt its economy, harm state-owned banks that have lent to the metal industries and create unrest among workers who lose their jobs. But experts like Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, say that the United States, the European Union and other countries could pressure China to move faster to address this problem, especially if they worked together. Characteristically, the Trump administration has displayed none of the diplomatic and economic savvy required to get China to change its policies. On Jan. 12, 2017, the Obama administration filed a case with the World Trade Organization that accused China of unfairly subsidizing aluminum producers and thus driving down global prices for the metal. But Mr. Trump’s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has failed to ask the W.T.O. to convene a panel of judges to hear the case, effectively suspending it. Mr. Lighthizer’s office declined to answer questions about the case. Perhaps Mr. Lighthizer, a trade lawyer who has represented the steel industry, did not believe the case would have been successful because he shares Mr. Trump’s contempt for the W.T.O., an organization the United States was instrumental in creating to help prevent trade wars. Last month, Mr. Trump said the organization “makes it almost impossible for us to do good business,” arguing that American officials get to pick too few judges on its dispute resolution panels. But these assertions are belied by the fact that the United States has won nearly 86 percent of the cases it has brought before the W.T.O. since 1995. Another opportunity for addressing excess steel production came in talks last summer between Chinese officials and Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. The Chinese told the Americans they would be willing to reduce China’s steel production capacity by 150 million tons by 2022. But Mr. Trump rejected the offer. An unnamed administration official told The Financial Times that Mr. Trump wasn’t interested in striking a deal because he had already decided that he wanted to impose tariffs. By now it should surprise no one that Mr. Trump prefers empty statements to doing the work needed to achieve lasting change. The former is easy to deliver in tweets and public pronouncements, while the latter takes patience and persistence. The president would rather impose tariffs and claim he is protecting the country and bringing back lost jobs than take the time to properly address the problem of excess Chinese steel and aluminum capacity. And he does not seem to care that, in doing so, he might penalize and anger an ally like South Korea, with which the United States needs to work closely on potential negotiations with North Korea, an unpredictable adversary. The president’s approach should worry everyone concerned about a trade war or the health of the steel and aluminum industries.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Donald Trump’s Tunnel Vision,"Editorial Some actions by political leaders are capricious. Some can be shortsighted. And some are sheer lunkheaded. President Trump hit the trifecta last week when he encouraged the House speaker, Paul Ryan, to scrap start-up money for an additional rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, a project essential to the economic health not only of those two states but of the entire country. Worse yet, the president’s action bore no relation to objective analysis of the region’s infrastructure needs. Accounts in The Times and The Washington Post said he did it to spite the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, whose sin is failure to fall in lock step with Mr. Trump on a variety of issues. This is foolishness. Republicans and Democrats alike broadly agree on the essentiality of the so-called Gateway tunnel, described by many officials as the most urgently needed infrastructure project anywhere in the United States. It will not come cheap, with $11 billion required for the first phase and an estimated $19 billion more needed to finish the job. “People get frightened by the cost,” said John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. “But the alternative is worse.” Existing tunnels under the Hudson River are more than a century old and stressed by damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Losing one of those tubes would greatly reduce train capacity, to devastating effect. With the metro region said to account for about 10 percent of the national economy, it doesn’t take a seer to appreciate that such a blow would be, to borrow from Mr. Trump when he’s in high dudgeon, a disaster. It was bad enough that in 2010 then Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey killed a predecessor to the Gateway, a project known as ARC, or Access to the Region’s Core. That decision hit the same trifecta. The Obama administration, graced with the good sense to make a top priority of a new tunnel across the Hudson, agreed informally to have Washington split the initial costs with New Jersey and New York. When officials from both states met with Mr. Trump in September, they were led to believe he was fully on board with a similar funding plan. That commitment grew shaky in December, when an administration official expressed grave doubts. Now Mr. Trump seems intent on plunging a dagger through the project’s heart by pressing Mr. Ryan to eliminate $900 million for Gateway in a House spending bill expected to be voted on this month. It is but one instance among many of the president showing zero concern for the region and the city that created his wealth and his reputation. More than most states, New York and New Jersey are adversely affected by his 2017 tax legislation, by his anti-immigrant rhetoric and by his lack of interest in lifting a finger to help rescue his hometown’s ailing mass transit system. Assuming Mr. Trump doesn’t change his mind — he can be as constant as a reed in a stiff wind — the best hope may be that Mr. Ryan shows backbone, for a change, and supports money for Gateway as benefiting the nation. It may be worth noting that Mr. Trump urged the speaker to eliminate the funding when they were together at the Capitol for a memorial ceremony for the Rev. Billy Graham. It would have been a fitting time for both men to recall words from Luke 6:48, about the importance of building well and laying a foundation on rock so that “when a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it.”",The New York Times
2018,Donte DiVincenzo and Trevon Duval Give Delaware Hoops a Moment,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware is known for its association with a recent vice president of the United States, the du Pont family and friendly bankruptcy laws. For its basketball pedigree? Not so much. Donte DiVincenzo always wanted to become a professional athlete. But as with many Delawareans, his favorite sport was soccer. When he started to concentrate on basketball, shortly before high school, the decision was unpopular. There have been only 16 athletes inducted into the state’s sports hall of fame for basketball. Three were referees. But Delaware’s basketball chops have never been stronger, now that two products of the First State are competing in the round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament: DiVincenzo, the sixth man for Villanova, and Trevon Duval, the starting point guard for Duke. A third, Peyton Heck, is a Villanova walk-on. “If you’re from Delaware, you’re part of a very big family,” said Elena Delle Donne, the W.N.B.A. star and perhaps the most accomplished basketball player the state has produced. “Rooting for these guys on the national stage is a moment that everyone in Delaware will be tuning in to.” In other words, it’s rare. When was the last time a pair of Delawareans were playing key roles this late in March? “It’s been a while,” Stan Waterman, the coach at Sanford School in Hockessin, said. “I can’t really remember.” In fact, there have been more N.B.A. players to hail from Montana (10) than from Delaware (seven). And while, yes, Montana outdoes Delaware in size and population, consider that the District of Columbia has 10 times the N.B.A. pedigree with only two-thirds the population. There are some reasons for this. Delaware was one of two states last year in which more high school boys played lacrosse than basketball (the other was Maryland). There were more athletes playing soccer and football in the state as well. Richard Lapchick, chairman of the sports business management program at Central Florida and director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, said a lack of opportunity and top-flight competition in the state was mostly to blame. Delaware has only 59 high schools competing in one division in high school basketball. Doug Gelbert, author of “The Great(er) Delaware Sports Book,” which at 250 pages is a light read, said the state’s best players, such as the former Temple and N.B.A. guard Terence Stansbury, frequently traveled to Philadelphia from Newark, Del., for pickup games. “It’s not just hoops,” Gelbert wrote in an email. “Delaware has not had a national reputation in any sport since the days of rifle shooting about 100 years ago. Maybe billiards in the ’30s.” This has left Delaware with a bit of a Napoleon complex when it comes to basketball. It isn’t new. Spencer Dunkley, a University of Delaware center, once guaranteed to “walk back to Delaware” if his 13th-seeded team lost to fourth-seeded Louisville in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Naturally, it lost. That was in 1993. Delaware remains winless in the tournament. And the state is eager to shed its reputation as the drive-through interlude on Interstate 95 between two basketball hotbeds: Philadelphia and Baltimore. “Those states kind of ate us up,” Mark Sills, a longtime organizer of youth basketball, said of Pennsylvania and Maryland. “We’ve had great players come out of here, but we don’t get the publicity.” Even the publicity that players do get can have a sarcastic undertone. Villanova Coach Jay Wright, for instance, has called DiVincenzo the Michael Jordan of Delaware. The nickname has stuck. “He’s certainly put Delaware on a map,” DiVincenzo’s high school coach, Brendan Haley, said. Duval has put Delaware on his leg. The area code, 302, is tattooed on his left calf, along with the name of his hometown (New Castle). Though he went outside the state for high school, he maintains a connection. Last year, he returned to Sanford School, which serves grades K through 12, and where he went to middle school, to attend prom. “A lot of people are excited,” Scott Klatzkin, the voice of University of Delaware athletics, said. “There’s a lot of in-state pride when somebody from little old Delaware makes it.” Folks in Delaware still talk wistfully about Walter Davis, an adopted son (he was born in North Carolina and played at Sanford for a year, in 1973), and A.J. English, who was born in Wilmington and played two years in the N.B.A. for the Washington Bullets. The closest comparison for a player like Duval, however, might be Delle Donne, the Wilmington native and transcendent superstar for the University of Delaware, who was drafted second over all by the W.N.B.A.’s Chicago Sky in 2013. Sills said he had detected a clear uptick in interest among girls’ players thanks to her influence. The hope, Waterman said, is that Duval will have a similar impact for boys’ basketball in the state. “Whether he wants to, he’s carrying the flag right now,” said Waterman, a five-time state champion. “Everybody’s watching him. All the youth league coaches are talking about him and putting his face out there for all the youngsters.” Unlike Duval, DiVincenzo stayed around for high school, winning two state titles for Salesianum School in Wilmington. Before he showed up, the program had won more than 150 state titles in sports like swimming, cross-country and lacrosse, but never in basketball. At Salesianum on Tuesday, some students were wearing Villanova hats, which is understandable considering the campus is 30 miles away. Faculty members were eager to reminisce about DiVincenzo’s dazzling days as a Sallie. “He had some natural athleticism that was just so rare,” the Rev. Chris Beretta, the school’s principal (and assistant basketball coach), said. “You just never knew. He could all of a sudden just turn it on.” But after DiVincenzo’s junior year, a rumor began to circulate that he was planning to leave to attend a prep school out of state. It grew pervasive enough that Villanova’s coaches called Haley at Salesianum to assure him that they were not the ones encouraging him to leave. “If you’re in Delaware, that’s almost the thing to do,” Haley said. “People start talking about where you’re going to go.” Clearly, it touched a nerve. This is a problem for Delaware. Its best players are too often emigrating out because the competition outside the state is superior. “Better opportunities, bigger stage,” Duval said about his own decision to leave, a phrase Delawareans have heard often. Eric Ayala, a top 2018 prospect who is committed to play at Maryland, left Sanford after his sophomore year to attend a prep school in Connecticut and then IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. “Sometimes you’re that big fish in a small pond,” Waterman said. “And they just want to try different things.” DiVincenzo stayed, won another state title, and has been considered basketball royalty in the state ever since. “Every time I go home now, everyone knows who I am,” he said. “They welcome me anywhere.” It would be easy for the adulation to go to his head. But even the Michael Jordan of Delaware still plays with a chip on his shoulder. “I don’t want to say he’s better than Walter Davis,” Haley said, “but he’s given Delaware a new look.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Don’t Delete Facebook. Do Something About It.,"Opinion On March 16, as the buzzer sounded in perhaps the worst upset in N.C.A.A. tournament history, and my beloved University of Virginia went down to the 16th-seeded University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I had one thought: I need to deactivate my Facebook account. I did not want to endure the taunts and trash talk of my friends who cheer for Duke. I do this often. When I need to focus on a project or relax a bit, I turn off the noise that comes from Facebook — the constant stream of disturbing faces, angry comments and shallow pulls on my precious attention. I also lose the lovely pictures of puppies and babies. But sometimes it’s worth it to retreat from the addictive torrent of stimuli framed in blue. If you feel the same way about how Facebook affects your daily life, by all means suspend or even delete your account (not that Facebook makes it easy to). But don’t pretend it will make a difference to Facebook or to the state of the world. A Twitter movement known as #DeleteFacebook is motivated by the stream of terrible things that Facebook has been involved in, including the proliferation of hate speech, harassment and propaganda meant to undermine trust in democratic institutions. The final spark was the news that the British political data firm Cambridge Analytica had acquired Facebook data on 50 million Americans. But even if tens of thousands of Americans quit Facebook tomorrow, the company would barely feel it. Facebook has more than 2.1 billion users worldwide. Its growth has plateaued in the United States, but the service is gaining millions of new users outside North America every week. Like most global companies, Facebook focuses its attention on markets like India, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil and Mexico. At current rates of growth, it could reach three billion users by 2020. [Read more on how to delete Facebook and Instagram.] People in those countries are getting value out of Facebook; in some places, it’s one of the few reliable ways to keep in touch. In much of the developing world, Facebook is also the only news source that matters. This should horrify us. But it’s not a problem that will be solved by indignant Americans leaving the service. Moreover, quitting Facebook lets Google and Twitter off the hook. It lets AT&T and Comcast and its peers off the hook. The dangers of extremist propaganda and hate speech are just as grave on YouTube, which is owned by Google. Russian agents undermining trust in institutions and democracy are even more visible on Twitter. And every major telecommunications firm, as well as Google and Twitter, relies on surveillance systems similar to the one Facebook uses to run targeted advertising. Facebook is bigger and better at all of this than the others, but its problems are not unique. Facebook’s problems are not peripheral, not just some rough edges that can be sanded down. Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users, and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads. This is what makes Facebook Facebook. This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world. As long as that’s true, don’t expect Facebook to fix itself. Hope lies, instead, with our power as citizens. We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher. They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds. Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States, with 68 percent of American adults using it, according to the Pew Research Center. That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors, as it already has with Instagram, and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality. The Department of Justice should consider severing WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger from Facebook, much as it broke up AT&T in 1982. That breakup unleashed creativity, improved phone service and lowered prices. It also limited the political power of AT&T. The European Union has already stepped up its legal efforts to protect data. Its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, is intended to ensure that users understand and consent to data collection and how that data is used. Users won’t have to agree to give access to their data to start using a product. As with some recent American consumer finance regulations, data collection policies under the new European Union rules must be clear, concise and in plain language. Companies will have to declare up front how they will use the data, and users can withdraw consent at any time. This should significantly deter many abuses that companies like Facebook and Google have committed. It won’t repair the sins of the past. But it’s something. Regulatory interventions have limitations. As long as Facebook is big and rich, its algorithms will determine and distort much of what we read and watch. Our long-term agenda should be to bolster institutions that foster democratic deliberation and the rational pursuit of knowledge. These include scientific organizations, universities, libraries, museums, newspapers and civic organizations. They have all been enfeebled over recent years as our resources and attention have shifted to the tiny addictive devices in our hands. If we act together as citizens to champion these changes, we have a chance to curb the problems that Facebook has amplified. If we act as disconnected, indignant moral agents, we surrender the only power we have: the power to think and act collectively. We could even use Facebook to mount campaigns to rein in Facebook. It is, after all, a powerful tool for motivation, even if it’s a terrible tool for deliberation. So go ahead and quit Facebook if it makes you feel calmer or more productive. Please realize, though, that you might be offloading problems onto those who may have less opportunity to protect privacy and dignity and are more vulnerable to threats to democracy. If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust, the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse. Deactivation is the opposite of activism. OpinionColin Koopman",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Don’t Forgive War Criminals, a Former Hostage Says","Letter To the Editor: Re “The Ex-Jihadi in Plain Sight,” by Rania Abouzeid (Sunday Review, March 11): I’m all for forgiving and forgetting when it comes to foot soldiers, but “Saleh,” the subject of this profile, was an aide to the highest Nusra Front commander, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, and a member of his internal security apparatus. The Nusra Front, a jihadist organization in Syria, imprisoned me in the basement of its headquarters in Aleppo in the fall of 2012. I listened as Nusra fighters tortured members of the Syrian Parliament. In the boiler room at the end of the corridor, they hanged their fellow citizens by their wrists and shocked them, as they screamed, with cattle prods. I have no idea how many people they killed in this facility. I know that 13 Syrian families, the relatives of my prison comrades, continue to search for news of their lost sons and husbands. If Syria is ever to come back from this nightmare of a civil war, Europe must not continue to function as a retirement destination for Syrian war criminals. Journalists must stop writing about the war criminals as if they are characters whose struggles with the past are to be pondered, then sighed over, then held up as examples of moral complexity. The disappeared people about whom I speak might still be alive. If I encountered a retired senior member of the Nusra Front, I wouldn’t waste time going over moral complexities. Instead, I would ask: “Did you execute your prisoners? If not, where are they now?” THEO PADNOS, SÓLLER, MAJORCA The writer is an American freelance journalist.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Don’t Let Parole Become a Meaningless Concept,"Editorial Some felt Herman Bell deserved execution or at least a prison sentence of life without parole, but in mid-1970s New York those weren’t options. No question, Mr. Bell’s crime was a despicable assault on society itself. In 1971, with fellow Black Liberation Army radicals, he ambushed two police officers in Harlem, repeatedly and fatally shooting them as part of a war they had declared on the United States. Rather than being condemned to prison forever, Mr. Bell got 25 years to life. Now, at 70, and after more than 44 years behind bars, he has been granted parole by a New York State board, which found he had expressed “regret and remorse.” Long in coming though the statement was, he is said to have told board members this month: “There was nothing political about the act, as much as I thought at the time. It was murder and horribly wrong.” In mid-April, he could be freed from his maximum-security prison in the Hudson Valley. Despite angry reactions from law enforcement groups and others, the process worked as it should if parole is to amount to more than an empty word. Our prisons call themselves “correctional facilities.” The New York board found that Mr. Bell had indeed been corrected, based on a solid disciplinary record, a “sturdy network of supporters” and a likelihood of his now leading a “law-abiding life.” To lock him up forever even though deemed a changed man is to make a mockery of his sentence: “25 years to life” is not supposed to be cynical code for “life.” Parole is understandably fraught in cases of slain police officers. Emotions run high, as does posturing by the politically powerful. In New York, a notable example involves two women who were part of a leftist band that killed two police officers and a guard during a bungled robbery of a Brink’s armored car in 1981. Though plainly guilty of involvement in the crime, neither of the women, Kathy Boudin and Judith Clark, fired a shot. They both went on to become model prisoners who expressed remorse for their actions. Ms. Boudin was paroled in 2003. But the road to freedom has been rockier for Ms. Clark, denied parole once again last year despite having had her sentence commuted by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Bell case is a reminder of how brutal New York could be in the early 1970s, an era of supercharged racial and political hostilities. Mr. Bell’s victims, Waverly Jones and Joseph Piagentini, were among 12 police officers in the city shot to death in 1971. In contrast, it has taken the past 13 years to record 12 officer deaths. (The New York City police, too, are now far more restrained, fatally shooting eight criminal suspects in a typical year, compared with the 1971 toll of 93.) Officer Piagentini’s widow, Diane, remains implacably opposed to freeing Mr. Bell. The parole board’s decision, she said, “devalues the life of my brave husband” and “betrayed the trust” of police families. But relatives of Officer Jones have been more forgiving. In a 2014 interview with The Daily News, Waverly Jones Jr. said, “This man has been in prison for over 30 years and hasn’t gotten into so much as an argument.” To continue to lock him up, Mr. Jones said, “would only be for revenge.” He’s right. And vengeance is not supposed to guide a system of justice.",The New York Times
2018,Don’t Mess With Dagger John,"Bookshelf In his St. Patrick’s Day sermon in 1852, John J. Hughes, the newly minted first Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, raised a discomfiting cautionary flag. “There is reason to fear,” Hughes admonished the congregants at Old St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Mulberry Street, “that when God permits men or nations to prosper to the extent of their desires, it is a mark of his disfavor.” His warning that the worldly lure of America’s Manifest Destiny was already threatening his parishioners’ spiritual bonds suggested just how far Irish-Americans had progressed in the more than three decades since Hughes himself had immigrated from County Tyrone. Last year, in their “Sons of Saint Patrick: A History of the Archbishops of New York From Dagger John to Timmytown” (Ignatius Press), George J. Marlin and Brad Miner traced the evolution of the archdiocese. Now, just in time for St. Patrick’s Day, in “Dagger John: Archbishop John Hughes and the Making of Irish America” (Three Hills, Cornell University Press), John Loughery prodigiously profiles the most transformative archbishop of them all. Don’t be cowed because Mr. Loughery’s book is published by an academic press. He has written a comprehensive, insightful and robust biography of a transcendent but neglected figure. The region Hughes inherited as the coadjutor (or assistant) bishop in 1837 “was a nightmare scarcely imaginable today — in religious and civic terms, in educational and hygienic terms,” Mr. Loughery, a Manhattan English teacher, writes. New York’s law barring Catholic priests from even entering the state had been repealed only in 1784. And the growing influx of immigrants — even before the late-1840s famine in Ireland — was mortifying the city’s Protestant, Anglophile and nativist majority. Hughes aggressively defended his flock. After two Philadelphia churches were torched in anti-Catholic rioting, Hughes famously invoked the specter of Russia’s scorched-earth strategy as Napoleon approached. “If a single Catholic Church were burned in New York,” he warned municipal officials in 1844, “the city would become a second Moscow.” He fought for state support for parochial schools (when so-called public schools required Protestant Bible readings). He ostentatiously broke ground for a new St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue as a bold affirmation of Catholic ascendancy. He founded what became Fordham University. And while he would always insist that the symbol he affixed next to his signature was a crucifix, not a dagger, he redeemed his nickname by his single-minded campaign to recast Irish Catholics as less un-American than they were perceived as being. His aggressive lobbying for parochial school aid provoked violence against the episcopal residence, to which Walt Whitman responded: “Had it been the reverend hypocrite’s head, instead of his windows, we would hardly find it in our soul to be sorrowful.” The prevailing anti-Irish bias might have dissipated sooner but for the 1863 draft riots. Hughes blamed abolitionists for the war. He figured slavery’s demise would have been inevitable. But he favored conscription to preserve the Union. When his poor New Yorkers boisterously rebelled against the double standard that enabled the wealthy to buy their way out of the draft, Hughes initially responded with insipid appeals to the rioters “to retire to their homes with as little delay as possible.” If his vigorous defense of Irish immigrants sometimes crossed accepted boundaries between church and state, the backlash also seems extreme. After the draft riots, the diarist George Templeton Strong concluded: “I am sorry to say that England is right about the Irish.” Even a century later, the Rev. Andrew Greeley would write in “The Catholic Experience” that Hughes, in protecting a flock unable to survive on its own against a hostile environment, was a “fierce and terrible man.” Mr. Loughery is unsparing in his warts-and-all biography, but also more empathic in placing “Dagger John” in perspective as an ambitious prelate whose disagreements with the Vatican over slavery and other issues denied him his coveted red hat. “He had an acid tongue, he never suffered fools gladly, he hated admitting when he was wrong, and at his worst his ego was more befitting a Tammany boss than a servant of Christ — there would be no point denying that,” Mr. Loughery writes. But he adds: “Hughes wanted to be a cardinal, not a saint.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Don’t Run From Trump,"Opinion HOUSTON — I’m here to tell my fellow Republicans, in particular Republican members of Congress and the Republican consulting class: You can run, but you can’t hide. President Trump may not be on the ballot in November, but the election will be a referendum on him, as 2010 was on President Barack Obama and 2006 was on President George W. Bush. We will lose seats. The only question is this: Will these losses be catastrophic or manageable? That will be determined by a very specific choice: Will the party retreat from its leader or fix bayonets and storm to the front with him? No one fought Mr. Trump harder and longer than I did, as the campaign manager for Ted Cruz’s 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination. I know the maddening brilliance of Mr. Trump. I also know history doesn’t favor the president’s party in midterm elections. With the election of a Democrat in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania — a district Mr. Trump carried by 20 percentage points, but which also has tens of thousands more registered Democrats than Republicans — it has become media gospel that the president is toxic and that Republican candidates will have to distance themselves from him. That narrative is wrong. For starters, I am not persuaded that the national Democrats will allow many more personally anti-abortion, pro-gun, anti-Pelosi Democrats in battleground seats to win nomination. Among Democratic candidates, Conor Lamb, the victor in Pennsylvania, is the exception, not the rule. While some Republican candidates, in swing seats, may benefit from creating distance from Mr. Trump, a strategic retreat will work only in rare instances. The myth that midterms are decided by swing voters ignores the prevailing reality that large midterm electoral shifts are driven by shifts in base motivation. If you are a Republican on the ballot, you are in the same boat as Mr. Trump, whether you like it or not. If enough people jump ship, generic party identification will suffer, and everyone will sink. In other words, if enough Republicans run from their leader, the Republican brand will be so diminished as to produce historic defeats up and down the ballot. This happened to the Democrats in 2010. To their credit, the Democratic consultants and members of Congress never formed a professional class of Never Obama Democrats. They stayed in the boat. But when it came to defending Obamacare, they stopped rowing. The lesson for Republicans: Stay in the boat and keep rowing. No, you don’t have to support the president’s tweet storms. But you do have to defend his policy accomplishments. If the election is only a personality contest — rather than about the president’s policies — a historic defeat awaits. It is undoubtedly difficult to differentiate Trump policies from the Trump persona, because the Trump persona dominates news coverage. But Republican candidates for Congress have to try. Tactically, that means being laser-focused on generating local news coverage of policy accomplishments, even when the national cable news fixates on the latest Trump outrage. And guess what? Despite breathless coverage of the daily outrage generator in the White House, the economy is improving. The tax cuts will, and in fact already are, spurring growth, freeing capital for investment, creating jobs and returning overseas profits to our shores. There is a message to sell. So sell it. I would go further and argue that it is the Trump persona so vilified in the media that has in fact made bolder, more sweeping reforms possible than would have been conceivable under almost any other Republican who might have been elected. Would a President Jeb Bush have signed a strong executive order on religious liberty, or would a President Marco Rubio have started construction of a wall? Would President John Kasich have had the intestinal fortitude to execute such a huge reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency, dismantling the liberal bureaucracy that with its deeply embedded biases harms our economy? Would President Mitt Romney have pushed through such a major tax overhaul? No way. What makes Mr. Trump different is that he just doesn’t care what the bed-wetting caucus says about his policies. Instead of wringing our hands about his tweets, let’s start playing up his triumphs. That is the best way to minimize midterm damage. Democrats lost over 1,000 seats nationwide under Mr. Obama. While effective in engineering his own political fate, he gutted the hopes of Democrats for a decade. Republicans have to learn to do what Democrats failed to do: run campaigns as the governing party. Half the consulting class on our side has spent half of their careers, if not more, running opposition campaigns. They have had the tailwind of resentment and grievance fueling popular anger. Now they have to flip the script. They have to learn to highlight accomplishments like tax reform, job creation and regulatory relief. The Republican Party will either rally around its Republican president — and defend our shared accomplishments — or it will enter the fall with a depressed base and a turnout disadvantage that will lead to major losses in Congress, governorships and state legislatures. Manageable losses or catastrophic defeat: What will it be, my fellow Republicans? My answer: Fix bayonets and charge the hill.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Don’t Turn a Radical Activist’s Death Into a TV Melodrama,"Vanessa Barbara SÃO PAULO, Brazil — It has been more than a month since Brazil’s Army took control of public security in the state of Rio de Janeiro, following a presidential decree to tackle crime. One of the most eloquent voices against that intervention had been Marielle Franco, a 38-year-old black bisexual woman who came from the Maré favela and was a member of Rio’s City Council. On March 14, she was assassinated with four shots in the head after attending an event with other black young women in downtown Rio de Janeiro. Ms. Franco was elected in 2016 and was the only black female representative on Rio’s 51-seat City Council. She was an outspoken defender of human rights, a feminist, a mother and a member of the Socialism and Liberty Party, and she had just been named rapporteur of a legislative commission that would monitor the military intervention. “Who watches the watchers, right?” she asked in an interview last month. “Who should be accountable?” This wasn’t a rhetorical question; it was an urgent issue. Last January in Rio de Janeiro, at least 154 people were killed by the police; six police officers were murdered while on duty. Most of those people — the civilians and the police officers — were black and came from Rio’s poorest neighborhoods. There’s a worry those numbers will rise with the military in charge. The top commander of Brazil’s Army, Gen. Eduardo Villas Bôas, recently said that his troops needed “guarantees to act without the risk of a new Truth Commission in the future,” a reference to the investigation into the abuses under the military dictatorship that lasted from 1964 to 1985. The commander has also expressed interest in getting “collective warrants” that would be issued for a broad area — for example, an entire favela — rather than a specific address. Marielle Franco advocated for all of the victims in this “war on drugs.” While working on the Rio City Council’s Human Rights Commission, she’d helped dozens of families of officers killed on duty. In seven years, she said, she’d never visited a family who lived “from Tijuca to downtown,” meaning that most police officers reside in the poorest outskirts of Rio. “And they are generally black,” she said. But she was also a fearless critic of state violence. She had worked as an aide for a parliamentary commission that investigated the involvement of the police and politicians in militias. A few days before she was murdered, she accused the 41st Military Police, the city’s deadliest unit, of terrorizing and harassing the residents of the Acari favela. On the eve of the murder, she mourned the death of Matheus Melo, a 23-year-old who was shot while leaving church. “Another homicide of a young man that might be attributed to the police,” she wrote on Twitter. “How many more people need to die before this war ends?” The identity and motive of Ms. Franco’s killers remain unknown, but it’s clear that the crime was premeditated: The assassins waited for her to leave the event and then followed her in two cars for a few miles. Then they engaged in a carefully targeted shooting and quickly left the scene without taking anything. According to investigators, the bullets came from police ammunition stocks. (The public security minister, Raul Jungmann, said he believed that they had been stolen from a post office.) Brazil is one of the deadliest countries for human rights defenders in the world, alongside Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines. According to a report issued by Front Line Defenders, 67 activists were killed in Brazil last year. Of all the cases tracked by Front Line Defenders, only 12 percent resulted in the arrest of suspects. This seems to prove the sinister efficacy of the killings. Even when the murders of Brazilian human rights defenders do receive coverage in the news media, people here frequently create other narratives to explain the murders: The person was killed by a lover, or by drug traffickers or by the mob, or committed suicide. And worse: the person might have deserved it. It’s happening now with Ms. Franco. Soon after her killing, fake news began to circulate on social media. Some items said she was married to a drug trafficker, others that she was a member of a criminal organization. Some articles said she had smoked pot. Some articles claimed that she had a baby at 16. What a crime! (The truth: She had a baby at 19, a girl named Luyara. I cannot image how this is relevant to her assassination.) A few weeks on, the narrative around Ms. Franco’s death is changing once again. Television newscasts play up the melodrama, focusing on the human tragedy; we can never get enough close-up shots of family members crying. Then they use this weeping momentum to put everything under the broader umbrella of Rio’s “violence” so that they can conclude by happily announcing that the federal government will liberate a couple of extra hundred million reals for the military intervention in Rio de Janeiro. Problem solved. This is exactly the opposite of what Marielle Franco stood for. She spent her days fighting inequality and injustice — not against an abstract notion of “violence.” So there’s no point in bringing more terror and repression to favelas, killing more of the same people (black, young and poor). Diverting resources from areas such as health and education to fund more bullets and tanks will only aggravate the violence. For that matter, Ms. Franco had advocated a new drug policy that didn’t involve armed incursions into communities. She also supported more diversity in political representation, encouraging the participation and candidacy of women and L.G.B.T. and indigenous people. Her way was the democratic way — not the authoritarian way of military rule. She saw herself and other women as a “real threat to the status quo,” as she wrote last year in a newspaper article. In her opinion, the government wanted to constrain democracy in Brazil. “But we, black women from the poor neighborhoods, are going to affront this authoritarian nonsense,” she said. Her last words caught on tape were addressed to a crowd of young black women: “Let’s go together and occupy everything.” An earlier version of this article misstated the date on which Marielle Franco was killed. It was March 14, not March 16.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Don’t Worry About Trump’s Tariffs,"Op-Ed Contributor Last week President Trump announced new tariffs on steel and aluminum products, and the response couldn’t have been more negative — critics warned of trade wars, recession, global instability. But the blowback is overblown, and seems to constitute reflexive anti-Trump sentiment rather than careful economic reasoning. To be clear, there’s plenty to hate about the policy course charted by the Trump administration. His anti-trade stance is of a piece with an agenda rooted in xenophobia and bigotry that has favored the rich over low- and moderate-wage workers. But despite this record, and despite the near-dogma status of free trade among economic writers, the proposed tariffs won’t end the world, and may even do some good. First, let’s take them for what they are: temporary relief for specific sectors (steel and aluminum) facing a specific problem (global excess production capacity, propped up by foreign governmental subsidies). America has taken steps like this before, and did not slide down any slippery slope to autarky. This means that big-picture principles — like, “Free trade is good,” or, “Globalization decimated the American working class” — aren’t very helpful in assessing them. For example, America’s trading partners have had to agree to increase their levels of intellectual property protection as a condition for more open access to American markets in agreements like Nafta and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. Yet proponents of these agreements have felt free to call them “free trade” treaties, even as these agreements instituted far higher levels of effective protection for specific sectors (mostly pharmaceuticals and software) than what was announced this past week for steel and aluminum. It seems clear that protection for the profits of pharma and software companies agitates business writers and some economic policy experts far less than protection for manufacturing sectors heavy with blue-collar jobs. Is it any real shock that many believe that the rules of the game governing globalization have been rigged against typical American workers? If we accept for a second that inconsistently applied first principles won’t get us very far in assessing the pros and cons of last week’s tariff announcements, it’s worth thinking about the specific challenges facing American steel and aluminum producers and how trade policy might help them. Start with something everybody agrees upon: Global steel and aluminum sectors have large amounts of excess productive capacity. The problem is large enough that last year the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued a report on global excess steel capacity. Generally, excess capacity pushes down prices, and less efficient firms that cannot make profits at these lower prices simply go out of business, pulling down capacity until it matches demand. But foreign producers of steel and aluminum, efficiently or not, have often been insulated from this competitive winnowing by government industrial policy that props them up — a fact bemoaned by both the G-20 and the Obama administration. The proposed tariffs can provide a countervailing force against these foreign subsidies and protect American metal producers until a comprehensive solution is found. Am I confident that the Trump administration will back a smart and efficient solution to the larger problem? Not really — but this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be happy to have some breathing room to find one. Some would argue that we should just see foreign steel subsidies as a boon for American consumers, who can now enjoy lower prices driven by cheaper steel. But here’s where the relative size of these “killer” tariffs becomes clear — we’re talking about fractions of a percent in prices, one way or the other. And again, no one is telling pharmaceutical companies and their workers that their protections need to be stripped away so that others can enjoy cheaper prices. The real problem with last week’s tariffs is that they’re an ad hoc and insufficient ameliorative fix for continuing policy failures that have decimated American manufacturing employment for almost two decades. The two main failures have been macroeconomic policy that has accepted long and slow post-recession recoveries, and exchange rate policies that have allowed the value of the dollar to stick at levels too high to balance (or even nearly balance) manufacturing trade flows. This means that each job displaced by manufacturing imports is not balanced by a job supported by manufacturing exports. It’s tempting to evaluate economic policy these days with a rule of “if Trump is for it, I’m against it.” After all, this rule would lead to the right stance far more often than not. But a better framework is to ask: “Is it good for the bottom 90 percent of American workers and the families they help support?” And on this latter question, criticism of last week’s tariffs largely misses the mark.

2018,Doors-Off Helicopter Flights Under Scrutiny After East River Crash,"The five passengers who were killed when a helicopter without doors splashed into the East River on Sunday night were cinched into heavy-duty harnesses and tied to the helicopter floor with only a knife to free themselves from frigid waters. Given little more than a brief safety video beforehand, they were left at the mercy of a stiff current as the helicopter dragged them 50 blocks south, upside down and underwater, before rescue divers could cut them free. The crash — the deadliest involving a helicopter in New York City since 2009 — exposed what aviation experts called startling safety gaps in the fast-growing industry of doors-off photo flights, once reserved for professional photographers but increasingly marketed to tourists looking to dangle their feet outside and share stomach-churning pictures of the skyline on Instagram. In major cities, including Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco, sightseers who are untrained, unaware of proper escape maneuvers and underdressed for wind-whipped conditions routinely climb into the doors-off helicopters, with regulatory agencies providing scant oversight. Before circling the Statue of Liberty and heading toward Manhattan on Sunday night, passengers watched a roughly 10-minute video that showed them a knife in their harnesses they could use if they got trapped. But the briefing did not include any discussion about how to saw through the nylon ties should the helicopter need to ditch in the water surrounding Manhattan. And one passenger who watched the presentation before boarding a different flight said the staff never pointed out the knives once they were strapped in, leaving him oblivious to where his was. The harnesses, tangles of thick straps and metal clasps that let tourists lean out over the skyline without worry, quickly became underwater death traps. “It’s not regulated and it should not be allowed,” said Gary Robb, an aviation lawyer who represented a cameraman who was killed when an open-sided helicopter hit a power line in Iowa in 2006. “It’s like allowing someone to walk on the wing of an airplane, and in my judgment poses too much of a risk.” Investigators were wrestling with a thicket of questions after the crash. Among them were what caused it, why the helicopter’s yellow inflatable pontoons did not keep it from flipping over and sinking and what more, if anything, the pilot could have done afterward to save his passengers. The victims were Trevor Cadigan and Brian McDaniel, both 26, high school friends from Dallas; Carla Vallejos Blanco, 29, of Corrientes, Argentina; and Daniel Thompson, 34, and Tristan Hill, 29, who a law enforcement official said were both employees of the helicopter company that operated the flight. The pilot, Richard Vance, 33, a former helicopter instructor from Connecticut, said on a mayday call that there was “engine failure.” He later told investigators that the fuel shut-off switch may have inadvertently been hit by passengers or somehow become wrapped up in onboard equipment or a strap, choking off supply to the engine. Aviation experts said it was not clear how that could have happened, given that the switch was on the floor in the front area of the cabin and that loose objects are barred from doors-off flights. Aviation experts said the helicopter appeared in cellphone video to have made a gradual descent that passengers could have survived, had the helicopter not tipped over and submerged. That raised questions about whether the pontoons — flotation devices activated by the pilot or by contact with water that run along the landing skids — were properly inflated. Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board said at a news conference on Monday that all the pontoons deployed, but they were examining how quickly and whether they had been properly maintained. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on the Federal Aviation Administration to suspend the license of Liberty Helicopters, the large sightseeing and charter company based in New Jersey that owns and operates the Airbus AS350 B2 that crashed. The company has a checkered safety record. It was also involved in a collision over the Hudson River in 2009, in which a helicopter hit a small private plane, killing six people on the helicopter and three on the plane. Two years earlier a Liberty tour helicopter crashed into the Hudson River; all the occupants survived. Bruce Hunt, an aviation safety consultant in Colorado, said tour companies have terrible safety records. “They kill people every year,” he said. Previous crashes have often prompted calls to restrict helicopter traffic in the crowded skies over Manhattan. But aviation experts on Monday homed in on the lightly regulated, little-known industry of doors-off photo flights. FlyNYON, the company that booked the flight, says on its website that it makes the thrill of taking pictures from an open-sided helicopter “accessible to everyone.” Customers are not required to have any training in photography or experience with helicopters, but they must be at least 12 years old. Mr. Hunt said Liberty would likely have needed a supplemental-type certificate from the aviation administration to use the harnesses. But it was unclear what rules, if any, dictated the kind of harnesses required on an open-sided helicopter. Citing the pending investigation, a spokesman for the aviation administration declined to say what special permissions Liberty had. The N.T.S.B. investigators said it was legal for the helicopter that crashed to have its doors open, but answered few questions about whether it had prior mechanical problems or whether it met any other regulatory requirements for doors-off flights. Investigators said they would look at whether the harnesses worked. The pilot spoke with local investigators after the crash and the N.T.S.B. said it would also seek an interview. FlyNYON Air and Liberty Helicopters said in separate statements that they were cooperating with the federal investigations. Passengers started gathering about an hour early for the 6:45 p.m. flight from New Jersey on Sunday. Eric Adams, an aviation journalist and photographer who was assigned to a different flight at the same time, said some of the passengers on the helicopter that crashed were dressed in light jackets, having apparently never been told by the tour company how cold it could get with the doors open and rotors spinning above. Mr. Adams said some of the preparations seemed careful and deliberate. But he said there were no pilots or safety experts at the video presentation, which he said omitted certain important warnings, like how to avoid the rotors while escaping a downed helicopter. Riders were strapped in from the rear, with a carabiner attaching the back of their harness to a tether that connected to the helicopter. They were also buckled in with seatbelts. Mr. Adams said even though he had flown in similar helicopters before, he did not know where his knife was or how to unlock the carabiner. “The training that we had before takeoff wasn’t good enough to prepare anybody for what could happen,” he said. “They just need a better harness system. They’re not adequate.” After Mr. Vance’s helicopter encountered trouble shortly after 7 p.m., Mr. Vance “pointed away from the city and toward the river,” a law enforcement official said. “He didn’t want to go down in Manhattan, so he went toward the river, because it seemed like the best option for a landing.” A tugboat, the Foxy 3, was returning to its base on Staten Island when the men aboard apparently heard the mayday call, the official said. They helped rescue the pilot and tied off the helicopter to keep it from sinking 50 feet to the bottom of the river. Rescue divers arrived on scene minutes after the first 911 call. But unable to dive in while the tug propellers were on, they had to tell the captain to cut the propellers. A three-knot current dragged them south as they tried to cut the passengers out. The police and firefighter divers appeared to free one passenger soon after submerging, but it may have taken until the helicopter drifted from 86th Street to a pier at 34th Street for the divers to free the rest of the passengers, the official said. After Mr. Adams’s helicopter returned to the base in New Jersey, he went to retrieve his belongings from a big locker where passengers on all the evening flights had stored items to avoid them falling out of the helicopter. He and his companions removed their belongings, but there were still things sitting at the bottom of the locker when he left that no one retrieved: a few wallets, car keys and a purse.",The New York Times
2018,Dorm Living for Professionals Comes to San Francisco,"SAN FRANCISCO — In search of reasonable rent, the middle-class backbone of San Francisco — maitre d’s, teachers, bookstore managers, lounge musicians, copywriters and merchandise planners — are engaging in an unusual experiment in communal living: They are moving into dorms. Shared bathrooms at the end of the hall and having no individual kitchen or living room is becoming less weird for some of the city’s workers thanks to Starcity, a new development company that is expressly creating dorms for many of the non-tech population. Starcity has already opened three properties with 36 units. It has nine more in development and a wait list of 8,000 people. The company is buying a dozen more buildings (including one-star hotels, parking garages, office buildings and old retail stores), has raised $18.9 million in venture capital and hired a team of 26 people. Starcity said it was on track to have hundreds of units open around the San Francisco Bay Area this year, and thousands by 2019. These are not micro-units, nor are they like WeWork’s WeLive housing developments, where residents have their own small kitchens, living rooms and bathrooms but share common event space and industrial appliances for parties. These are not single-family homes that are being used as group houses. Instead, Starcity residents get a bedroom of 130 square feet to 220 square feet. Many of the buildings will feature some units with a private bath for a higher rent. But Jon Dishotsky, Starcity’s co-founder and chief executive, said a ratio of one bathroom for every two to three bedrooms makes the most sense for large-scale affordability. The average one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco rents for $3,300 a month, but Starcity rooms go for $1,400 to $2,400 a month fully furnished, with utilities and Wi-Fi included. “If you think about the most private things that you do, a lot of them are related to the bathroom,” said Mr. Dishotsky, 34. “So that’s probably the hardest part.” Starcity’s target demographic makes $40,000 to $90,000 a year. Most of the residents, who range in age from their early 20s to early 50s, have no political philosophy around communes nor any previous experience in them. Moving in was a practical decision they each made. But after they arrive, what they are most surprised by is how much the building changes them. One recent night, the Mission Street house gathered to celebrate a set of birthdays, and there in a party hat was Carla Shiver, 38. Last year, Verizon eliminated Ms. Shiver’s job in Albany, Ga., but offered to transfer her to San Francisco to work at a store. Ms. Shiver, who makes about $85,000 a year, knew she could never afford a house here but moved anyway. “People talk all the time about what they dream of, and I decided to stop talking about it and just do it,” Ms. Shiver said. “I was looking for more meaning.” She divorced her husband, packed her Yorkie Pomeranian, Stanford, in the car and drove west. The idea of sharing a bathroom was initially alarming, but the pictures of the house looked nice and Ms. Shiver wanted to meet new friends. For $2,200 a month, she now rents a Starcity room with a queen-size bed, a bedside table and a chair. She said she could not imagine any other life. “I’ve run a household; I’ve done the bills; I’ve mowed the yard, and I don’t want to be responsible again,” Ms. Shiver said. “I want to paint and learn how to make ramen noodles. And when we run out of tinfoil, there’s just more tinfoil.” The Starcity community manager (a.k.a. the building manager) is extremely involved in household affairs, dropping off care packages when someone is sick and organizing birthday parties. If tenants sign up for premium services, Starcity will do their laundry for $40 a month, clean rooms for $130 a week and even arrange for dog day care. For many residents, the arrangement does not feel temporary. “I never thought I could live like this,” Ms. Shiver said. “But the more I live here, the freer I feel.” She said she had not locked her bedroom door once since moving in, and most days when she gets home from work, a roommate has taken her dog into the shared living room. She said she hardly thought about the dorm-style bathroom setup, that there had never been a line for a shower, and that the building was like a family. “This afternoon we’re going to the Exploratorium,” she said, referring to the science museum located at Pier 15. Mr. Dishotsky looked very much the part one morning as he walked into a building site. Wearing muddy leather boots, black jeans and a hard hat, he examined Mason Street, formerly a residential hotel that served homeless and low-income people in the Tenderloin neighborhood. It will soon be 71 Starcity units. The Tenderloin, a traditionally working-class and diverse neighborhood with a large arts scene and a sizable homeless population, has been slowly gentrifying, leading to rising tensions. (Most of Starcity’s residents are white.) On the sidewalk outside Mr. Dishotsky's construction zone that morning, there were used needles and several tents. He paced through the first floor’s 2,500-square-foot living room. The basement will be a communal kitchen, with a lineup of industrial sized refrigerators. The only thing people really need to do alone is sleep, he said. “What are the things you can do with other people? Eat food, drink wine, watch TV,” he said. “You don’t need to do that in your own unit alone, so why pay for it?” Mr. Dishotsky grew up in Palo Alto, Calif., where housing prices have soared and the median home value is now more than $3 million. His parents were both teachers and left-wing political activists living in an intentional community in the late 1960s before they bought a house for $50,000. After Mr. Dishotsky graduated from college, he spent a decade at a commercial real estate firm making deals until one day in 2015, he had a crisis. His friends were leaving town. The arts scene was fading. He saw a political cause and an economic opportunity. “My mom got shot once protesting for what she believed in,” he said. “And here I am building offices.” So he quit. He wanted to build something that, at market rate, would be affordable. When Mr. Dishotsky first tried to get a bank loan for his new type of pared-down housing, he was turned away by 40 lenders. “They were like, ‘Who would live this way?’” he said. “We’re like, ‘It’s everybody, it’s normal people you know.’” A couple blocks away was the Ellis Street building, a former bathhouse turned into medical offices that became a vacant property. Another developer had tried to turn it into 11 luxury condos. Mr. Dishotsky’s pitch was 52 dorm rooms. The move was both idealistic and practical. Because of arcane permitting rules and neighborhood associations that push against new developments, building new housing in San Francisco is painfully slow. But workers keep flooding the city, so roommates jam tighter into existing housing, already sharing bathrooms and renting living rooms as bedrooms. Mr. Dishotsky said he decided to build for what was already the city’s reality. At the Ellis Street site, his team is digging down about a level and a half to make a basement lounge. Each floor has a communal kitchen for eight to 15 people. He’s working with his co-founder, Mohammad Sakrani, 30, on new beds that can be hoisted up and suspended from the ceiling during the day. They are also trying to design modular bathrooms and even entire bedrooms that can be “plugged in” to buildings. In Starcity’s South of Market building, known as Gilbert House, which has a reputation for being the party house, tenants call themselves the Gilbertines. Migerta Ndrepepaj, 25, the headwaiter at the Nob Hill Club at the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins Hotel, said her favorite tradition was Sunday family days when the housemates cook together and go on adventures like renting go-karts. “That makes us sound like college kids,” Ms. Ndrepepaj said. “But we’re not.” For the annual San Francisco race and parade Bay to Breakers, the housemates rented sets of four-seater tandem bikes and cruised the city. For Halloween, they dressed as characters from “Alice in Wonderland” (Ms. Ndrepepaj was the White Rabbit). Recently, they all went to Lake Tahoe to a house that Starcity supplied. “You don’t have to think up plans anymore because they kind of do it for you,” she said. “And now, I live with my best friends.” The units are fundamentally not fancy, but Starcity adds accents that gives the spaces a trendy millennial look. Furniture is a midcentury-modern aesthetic. Plants hang in concrete pots on the walls alongside art that residents make on painting nights. “I feel like I’m in a relationship with everyone I live with,” Ms. Ndrepepaj said. “If their day is bad, your day is bad.” One evening back at Starcity’s Mission House, Rachel Haltom, 22, an account executive at Yelp, baked a birthday cake with Steph Allen, 24, a fashion boutique merchandise planner, for a housemate. Ms. Haltom had never made meringue, but Chris Maddox, 27, a writer, had come home and took over the egg-white whipping. One tenant announced a secret crush on another, and there was debate about the merits. They joked about alcoholic seltzer water, a new trend they all agreed was absurd, as Ms. Allen drank one. Before Starcity, Mr. Maddox paid $4,100 a month for a one-bedroom apartment and worked near constantly as chief executive of Seneca Systems, a start-up that provides software for local governments. What he wanted was to be a writer. Now, he pays $1,900 a month and lives in a cluttered bedroom with a bed, a record player and an overflowing bookshelf. Katherine McKim, 37, came home with her dog, Zoey, who trotted around the kitchen. Ms. McKim had worked for Penguin Random House in New York but always admired the San Francisco-based publisher Chronicle Books, so when she and her husband divorced, she packed up and moved out. (There are quite a few divorcées in Starcity.) “Everybody told me housing in San Francisco was really expensive, but I was like, ‘I live in New York, how much more expensive can it be?’” she said. “I was a bit cocky.” Now, for $2,050 a month, she has space for a dog bed for Zoey, a full-sized bed for herself, a TV, a mini fridge and a sink. Every other Wednesday is “wine night.” An upcoming Tuesday is “kombucha and yoga night.” On Feb. 14, it was “pal-entines day,” planned and hosted by Starcity.",The New York Times
2018,"Double, Double: Two Troublesome Takes on ‘Macbeth’","London Theater Reviews STRATFORD-UPON-AVON, England — “Macbeth” is Shakespeare’s shortest and most concentrated tragedy, shot through with well-known phrases and images. Why, then, is it so rarely satisfying when performed? You almost feel as if its infamous witches were having their wicked way with this vexed play, four centuries on. That question is worth returning to in the wake of fresh sightings of “Macbeth” at two of England’s most established theatrical institutions, the Royal Shakespeare Company, or R.S.C., here and the National Theater in London. Both have opened hot on each other’s heels. (Enthusiasts of “the Scottish play” can also catch Verdi’s opera based on it at the Royal Opera House from March 25; the choreographer Mark Bruce’s dance-theater version, meanwhile, is touring England through May.) The R.S.C. and the National’s productions have their virtues. But after seeing them in quick succession, I found myself pondering the curse that apparently haunts this play: It fails more consistently than it succeeds. While many actors find lasting acclaim playing Hamlet or, in later life, King Lear, celebrated Macbeths are comparatively rare, and not a few productions of “Macbeth” have become legendary failures — Peter O’Toole at the Old Vic in London in 1980, to name but one. Neither the R.S.C. nor the National production is a car crash. But both illustrate the difficulty in finding an appropriate physical landscape for a play whose real terrain is Macbeth’s diseased mind. What the play needs is some way to make sense of its unyielding savagery and darkness. Who are these jabbering women at the beginning, for instance, and how literally are we meant to take them? At Stratford-upon-Avon, the director Polly Findlay has cast three doll-clutching girls to play the witches. From the opening scene, they locate “Macbeth” in a forbidding supernatural realm that is unique in Shakespeare. The conceit suits this veritable abattoir of a play in which children exist to be done away with: Why shouldn’t these “weird sisters” function as an eerie reminder of that fact? Except, alas, that — even amplified — the child actors aren’t easy to hear. Later they are pressed into service to move the set around. Have the stagehands gone on strike? Nor is there much luxuriance in the language as spoken by Christopher Eccleston in the title role. He is a comparative newbie to Shakespeare and charges through Macbeth’s various set pieces with a flat and unvarying vocal attack. The actor comes naturally by the “rugged looks” spoken of by his wife (a jittery Niamh Cusack, who overplays Lady Macbeth’s spousal agitation). But rather than any sense of a murderous king spiritually hollowed out by his own ascent, we get Macbeth as a blunt, bluff pugilist who looks as if he would be happier taking on Jake LaMotta in “Raging Bull” than ruminating over matters of conscience. Ms. Findlay, the director, worked wonders with a wacky “As You Like It” several years ago at the National. But her modernist approach this time includes a faceless, multilevel set, drained of color but containing a water cooler next to which sits the Porter (an ever-deadpan Michael Hodgson), who now and then pushes a carpet sweeper around. Both her stars wander into the audience, to little purpose, and Ms. Cusack shows her bloodied palms to unsuspecting spectators in the front row. A clock above the stage counts down to Macbeth’s death, at which point Edward Bennett’s portly Macduff informs us, “the time is free.” Anyone craving a fuller sense of the psychic legacy of a warrior at odds with himself is better off with the National’s production, with the ravishingly spoken Rory Kinnear in the title role. His climactic “I have lived long enough” finds more power in a single line than the entirety of the R.S.C.’s brisk reckoning. Mr. Kinnear has won awards for playing Hamlet and Iago on the stage now hosting his Macbeth, and he knows his way through the sinuous, ever-shifting mind-sets of Shakespeare’s tragic leading men. (By contrast, Rufus Norris, this production’s director, last turned his hand to Shakespeare more than a quarter-century ago.) The production that surrounds Mr. Kinnear is guaranteed to enrage purists wanting Scottish accents and some explanation for the enormous trash bags hanging from Rae Smith’s cavernously gloomy set. A note in the program locates the action happening “now, after a civil war,” amid a grubby, grimy community concerned less with kingship than the mere rudiments of survival. The “royal preparation” for battle referenced in the text here consists of Mr. Kinnear affixing knives to his torso; beheadings, appropriately enough, frame the action. The soundscape couples ominous rumblings with high-pitched bleats, to evoke a post-apocalyptic ruin of a world in which Mr. Norris’s witches — adults, this time — shimmy up poles to survey the desolation below. If all this sounds like sound and fury signifying you know what, the result is at the very least an improvement on the shouty Lincoln Center “Macbeth” in New York in 2013 in which Anne-Marie Duff first played Lady Macbeth. She returns to that role (and to a happier onstage partnership) this time round. It’s worth remembering, too, that the same play brought to grief at least two of Mr. Norris’s predecessors as artistic director of the National, Peter Hall and Richard Eyre, whose stagings were met with lukewarm reviews, albeit 15 years apart. “Macbeth” demands a claustrophobia and intensity — and a forensic fury — that seems frustratingly tricky to capture, though not for wont of trying. At this rate, I wouldn’t be surprised to find a third “Macbeth” opening somewhere nearby next week.",The New York Times
2018,Dow and S.&P. 500 Have Their Best Day in Nearly Three Years: DealBook Briefing,"Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Best day for stocks in nearly three years. • A reality check on the White House’s tariff tactics. • Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook. • Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears. • Washington and Beijing hold trade talks. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent. It was the largest one-day point gain for the Dow since October 2008, according to The WSJ, and the biggest one-day percentage gain for S.&P. 500 and Dow since August 2015. Worries that the Trump administration’s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world’s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent. Tensions seemed to relax over the weekend. The WSJ reported late Sunday that “China and the U.S. have quietly started negotiating to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets.” Also, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview that he’s “cautiously hopeful” that China will reach a deal to avoid tariffs. Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week’s hardest hit sectors led the way. • The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively. • The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday. • Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher. • Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent. Investors last week looked at President Trump’s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent. Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer. From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers: “From the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn’t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.” Mr. Hassett’s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations. Investors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there. Mr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda. “If you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it’s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.” (Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.) Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war. — Peter Eavis The stock is down 6.5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook’s privacy practice. Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey. Facebook’s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago. To put Facebook’s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value. Despite the fall, Wall Street has not soured on Facebook. Forty-four analysts have buy ratings on the stock, compare to just two who have sell ratings, according to Bloomberg. The Apple C.E.O. said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations, after last week’s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica: “I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view, it shouldn’t exist.” Apple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn’t the only critic. Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla’s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one “looks lame anyway.” Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to “step up to the mark” and be responsible for content on its platform. And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook, highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance. (Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages.) Meanwhile, Facebook took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers — including the NYT — for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg. Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization’s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew. Andrew’s take Mr. Cook’s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is “subject to each country’s laws” that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door — and I believe that — most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied. As for Facebook’s ad, take note of this: “We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.” Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends. Elsewhere in privacy: Growing calls for privacy could seriously dent the business model of ad-supported internet. Federal law enforcement officials are renewing a push for a legal mandate that would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations. The activist investor’s fund, Third Point, has built a position in United Technologies, according to an antitrust filing. He is the second activist investor to reveal a stake in the United Technologies during the past 30 days. On Feb. 28, Bill Ackman told CNBC that his Pershing Square had a position in the defense contractor. Context At a conference late last month, Greg Hayes, the chief executive of United Technologies, said the company was thinking of splitting up: “Is [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That’s the question for the board. That’s the question we continue to study.” Shares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday. Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday. In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker. Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake. Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire’s stake in USG, according to the filing. The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG’s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share. From Reuters: The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG’s debt. The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG. Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday. With Sears Holdings increasingly desperate in its efforts to stay afloat, the company’s C.E.O. gave his first in-depth interview in roughly 15 years to William D. Cohan of Vanity Fair. Mr. Lampert spoke about his past successes and his current travails as the head of the troubled retailer. (Mr. Cohan also spoke with Renaldo Rose, the man who spearheaded the kidnapping of Mr. Lampert in 2003.) The money quote, from Mr. Lampert: “Put it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they’re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn’t believe that this company could be transformed still — the window is definitely shrinking — but if I didn’t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don’t know what that path exactly would be. It’s not a question of giving up or not giving up.” A bonus quote on Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert’s college roommate and a director of Sears before becoming Treasury secretary, from Mark Cohen, the former C.E.O. of Sears Canada: “[With] all of Trump’s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.” After a Friday that saw the markets sink amid fears of a trade war, the U.S. and China are holding high-level talks to defuse tensions, the WSJ reports. Leading them: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Liu He, Beijing’s economic czar. Among Washington’s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China. Mr. Mnuchin told “Fox News Sunday” that he believed the recent rate increase by the Federal Reserve was to blame for recent market declines, not tariffs. He added, “We’re not afraid of a trade war, but that’s not our objective.” News of the talks have lifted markets in Asia and Europe, while S.&P. 500 futures jumped this morning. It will also undoubtedly ease the fears of C.E.O.s, economists and foreign leaders and allies who have openly fretted about the prospect of a trade war.

Saturday’s marches could make gun control a potent issue in the midterm elections. And the U.S.’s broad support for gun control has many nuances. The media mogul spoke to Maureen Dowd of the NYT about: President Trump (not a fan); the current state of the media business (bullish on Netflix, bearish on Hollywood); and cloning his late dog, Shannon (he did it). Here’s what he had to say about workplace misconduct: “We recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, ‘Here’s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let’s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say “Yes” or “No.” If it’s “Yes,” go in good health and if it’s “No,” then it’s full stop.’ “But the end result of that is a guy, let’s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, ‘Oh, this is a smart guy. I’m promoting him.’ A woman now cannot be in that position.

2018,Dozens Leave Besieged Syrian Enclave Under Evacuation Deal,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — More than a hundred people left a rebel-held enclave in Syria on Tuesday after rebel forces reached a medical evacuation agreement with the Syrian government’s ally, Russia. The deal, brokered by the United Nations, came weeks after government forces began a ferocious assault to retake the insurgent stronghold. One hundred and seventy people — 31 of them sick or wounded, along with their families — were evacuated from eastern Ghouta to Damascus, Syria’s capital, through a checkpoint near Douma. They were but a small fraction of the estimated 1,000 people in need of emergency medical treatment but unable to get it within the besieged enclave, according to the Syrian American Medical Society. “We honestly feel reborn now that we have left Ghouta safely,” one resident told Syrian state television. which showed footage of the evacuation, facilitated by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. The government onslaught has killed more than 1,400 civilians since mid-February. Hospitals have been bombarded and medical supplies depleted, leaving residents weary and desperate. Hundreds of civilians have spent weeks huddled in underground bunkers — which grow more overcrowded and unsanitary by the day — out of fear of being bombed or shelled. One resident, Ward Mardini, has been sharing an underground shelter with more than 200 people. On Tuesday, she posted a letter to rebel groups on social media on behalf of those in the shelter. Residents were weary, the letter said, of rebel calls for steadfastness amid countless civilians deaths and the destruction of their homes. “For God’s sake, we believe you that Ghouta is very precious for you,” she wrote. “But we are tired, and we want a realistic solution to stop this waterfall of blood.” Fleeing eastern Ghouta has been riddled with challenges — often life-threatening ones — for the estimated 393,000 residents of the enclave, despite a 30-day cease-fire endorsed by the United Nations Security Council nearly a month ago. Although Russia announced the opening of two humanitarian corridors to the north and the south and a daily five-hour window for humanitarian aid, the attacks have scarcely subsided, making safe passage for civilians rife with peril. As government warplanes drop bombs, rebel snipers on the ground have reportedly shot civilians trying to reach the government side. Last week a spate of protests erupted, with frustrated residents calling for rebel groups to leave in the hope that if they did, the government would cease its bombardment. “All of them want this to end today before tomorrow,” Ms. Mardini said in her letter to the rebels. “All of them are tired of bombing and siege.”",The New York Times
2018,Dr. King’s Complex Relationship With the Camera,"RACE STORIES The most compelling photographs of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were neither idealized nor simplistic, but endeavored to portray his complexity and humanity. The images of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivering his “I Have a Dream” speech before a spellbound crowd on the National Mall in August 1963 are etched into history — and the American consciousness — as the defining moment in the struggle for civil rights. But that reading distorts the movement’s complex history, reinforcing the perception of Dr. King as an almost divine leader who was solely responsible for healing the nation’s troubled race relations. Historical images frame our understanding of history, and photographs defined Dr. King in the public imagination, for better or worse. His enemies manipulated photos or gave false captions to discredit him, from accusing him of communist ties to purporting that he encouraged violence during peaceful demonstrations. African-American newspapers and magazines routinely reported on the details of his life and activism through pictures, years before mainstream publications. And those mass media outlets — though at first circumspect and, in Dr. King’s final years, increasingly critical as he turned his attention to poverty, war and racism outside the South — nevertheless produced a visual narrative that helped transform a regional movement into a national one. If the news media sometimes vilified Dr. King, it also contributed to the mythic view of him as the charismatic leader “who single-handedly directed the course of the civil rights movement through the force of his oratory,” as the historian Clayborne Carson wrote of his distorted legacy. In that, photos became as powerful as words as Dr. King was transformed from a human being into a visual symbol of courage, fortitude, or benevolence: The stoic cleric posing for a mug shot after being arrested during the Montgomery bus boycott, or the consummate family man to whom white Americans could better relate. The idealization of Dr. King in his lifetime was set against a backdrop of white distrust and anxiety. While support for him remained high among black Americans, he was largely unpopular with white Americans. In a 1963 survey by the Gallup Organization that gauged national sentiment of public figures, only the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, was more disliked. By 1966, nearly two-thirds of Americans held an unfavorable opinion of Dr. King. If he was for many white people the standard-bearer of a black America that was otherwise unknown to them, the news media’s mythic imagery rendered Dr. King enigmatic. He had become, in contexts both positive and negative, the pre-eminent but two-dimensional icon of a political struggle that involved thousands of organizers, activists and sympathizers. By contrast, the most compelling photographs of him were neither idealized nor simplistic, but endeavored to portray his complexity and humanity. James Karales’s candid picture of Dr. King at the kitchen table, talking with his young daughter Yolanda, for example, reminds us that the lives of black Americans, no matter how famous, were inevitably fraught. Disappointment registering on his face, he was explaining to the child, for the first time, the perils of segregation and why she could not visit a restricted amusement park. A photograph of the civil rights leader in intense conversation with President Lyndon B. Johnson affirmed that he was not simply an activist clergyman, but also a tough negotiator adept at politics. What is perhaps most extraordinary about Dr. King and photography is not how the medium defined him, but how skillfully he used it to define the story of civil rights. He was a visual tactician who, along with his advisers, understood the power of the camera to expose the brutality and injustice of segregation. The historic “Children’s Crusade” in Birmingham, Ala., in May 1963, for example, was largely organized for the camera. Dr. King and his strategists recognized the need for pictures that would demonstrate the depravity of Jim Crow segregation to a skeptical public. Anticipating a fierce response from Bull Connor, the city’s segregationist commissioner of public safety, and aware of the media’s hunger for provocative images, they planned a nonviolent demonstration of more than a thousand schoolchildren. The pictures that came out of Birmingham — youngsters attacked by police dogs or knocked to the ground by fire hoses — were devastating. Seen around the world, these images broke through skepticism and complacency, providing unassailable evidence of the evil of segregation and how it imperiled democracy. A year later, Congress passed the landmark Civil Rights Act, legislation partly spurred by the shocking photographs and television news footage from Birmingham. But it was another widely-seen photograph, taken 50 years ago next week, that most dramatically challenged the myth of Dr. King: that of him lying mortally wounded on a balcony at the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis. Rather than an icon of the heavenly orator, imprisoned martyr, or revered prophet, the stark image transformed the civil rights leader into a human being destroyed by racial hatred. If photographs of Dr. King in life have served as a kind of Rorschach test — teasing out our capacity for acceptance, identification, or prejudice — that image of him in death is a sobering reminder of the extent to which myths are built on fantasy and projection, erasing the individuality of the people they enshrine. “I always saw Martin Luther King Jr. as this incredible spiritual leader, who spoke in a way that inspired people in emotional tones,” said the photographer Steve Schapiro of his famous subject. “What you don’t realize is that people are human at the same time. You can be a leader and still have your own particular worries.” Race Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

2018,Opinion | Dr. Ronny Jackson: A Poor Choice for the V.A.,"Letter To the Editor: Re “V.A. Chief Is Shown the Door, and In Comes Trump’s Doctor” (front page, March 29): As a retired police officer and a Vietnam veteran, I have been fortunate not to have had to rely on the V.A. for medical issues because of the medical coverage I received from my job and now through Medicare. It should be criminal how our veterans have been treated over the years, by both political parties. Thank you for your service, and don’t let the door hit you on the way out. Dr. David Shulkin, the outgoing V.A. chief, betrayed his position when he spent over $120,000 of taxpayer money on a trip to Europe with his wife. Hardly the actions of a dedicated public servant. Unfortunately, I think the choice to replace him, Dr. Ronny Jackson, is a poor one for many reasons, but at the top of the list is his lack of experience running, well, anything. That, and the glowing physical report he gave Donald Trump — a poster boy for hardening of the arteries — make him suspect in this veteran’s eyes. LEN DISESA, DOYLESTOWN, PA.",The New York Times
2018,"Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, Who Explored Babies’ Mental Growth, Dies at 99","Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, America’s most celebrated baby doctor since Benjamin Spock and the pediatrician who revolutionized our understanding of how children develop psychologically, died on Tuesday at his home in Barnstable, Mass., on Cape Cod. He was 99. His daughter Christina Brazelton confirmed the death. Before Dr. Brazelton began practicing medicine in the early 1950s, the conventional wisdom about babies and child rearing was unsparingly authoritarian. It was believed that infants could not feel pain. Parents were instructed to set strict schedules, demand obedience and refrain from kissing or cuddling. Babies were to be fed every four hours, by the clock, preferably from a bottle. When children were hospitalized, parents were allowed few if any visiting hours. Dr. Brazelton, echoing Dr. Spock, whose book “The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care” became a best seller in 1946, rejected such beliefs and practices as being senseless, if not barbaric. “He put the baby at the center of the universe,” Dr. Barry Lester, a pediatrician and director of the Center for the Study of Children at Risk at Brown University, said in an interview for this obituary in 2009. “We take for granted all the changes he helped bring about. He more than anyone is responsible for the return to natural childbirth, breast feeding and the ability of parents to stay with a hospitalized child.” Nevertheless, Dr. Brazelton’s work never entered mainstream pediatrics and is not taught in most medical curriculums. But the public loved the charismatic Dr. Brazelton. He wrote nearly 40 books and a column in Family Circle magazine, and he was the host of an Emmy Award-winning show, “What Every Baby Knows,” which ran for 12 years on the Lifetime cable channel. He also worked with Congress to pass parental leave legislation and other parent-friendly measures. Dr. Brazelton had a remarkable talent for handling infants and eliciting behaviors that no one before him had noticed. For example, he would hold a day-old infant in front of his face, lock eyes and move his head side to side. The baby followed. He developed strategies for how to get a baby to be quiet, to fall asleep, to come back to an alert state. The more he worked with newborns, the more he realized that they are complex, responsive and competent at birth, using behavior as their language. The movement of an arm or leg told him if they were feeling disorganized, stressed or good. Little hiccups might mean their nervous system was unstable. He realized that babies have the ability to control their internal state and to become engaged, or disengaged, according to what is happening in the world around them. Dr. Brazelton was one of the first researchers to use videotape to observe the dynamic interplay between mothers and infants. By freezing frames and replaying them hundreds of times, he was able to capture the subtleties of face-to-face interactions. The video camera became a tool for observing behavior, showing how mothers and infants cycle through rhythmic interactions lasting 15 to 20 seconds. The infants lead, the mothers follow. When a mother stops responding by putting on a deadpan face, her baby quickly becomes upset. The notion of mother-infant bonding, now gospel among early-childhood experts, grew out of this research, but Dr. Brazelton took it one step further — back into the clinic. He found that premature infants follow the face-to-face interactions and that the mothers lead. The babies are fragile, he said, and need extra help from their mothers. From these observations, Dr. Brazelton wrote a book, “Infants and Mothers: Differences in Development” (1969), which argued for the first time that newborns arrive in this world with a biologically based temperament. Moreover, he wrote, this intrinsic personality affects how parents interact with their infants: The infant’s temperamental repertoire drives the parenting style. Thus a hypersensitive baby might continually turn away from his mother’s gaze, causing her to feel rejected. But if the mother understands her infant’s sensitivity, she will not overwhelm him. Easygoing babies, on the other hand, are able to handle much more stimulation. The notion of human resilience — defined as successful adaptation in the midst of challenging or threatening circumstances — grew out of this research. In 1973, Dr. Brazelton published the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale, a method to elicit all the behaviors a newborn might have in a 24-hour period, including crying and self-soothing, within 20 minutes. The scale is intended to note infants’ best performance on 28 items involving how well they manage their sensory awareness. Some are bothered by bright lights and loud sounds, others not. Some can be soothed by swaddling, others not. Each infant has a different style for self-organizing. The N-Bas, as it became known, was criticized by many pediatricians, because, they noted, an infant’s score on one day did not necessarily correlate with its score on another day. Scores, they said, should be stable, like I.Q. But Dr. Brazelton was shocked by that view. “Why would I want or expect a baby’s score to stay the same from day to day?” he said. “If a baby does not change, then I worry.” In working with more than 25,000 infants and children over his career, Dr. Brazelton had another important insight: Development does not occur on a linear path, with each skill building on earlier ones. Rather, it unfolds in a series of major reorganizations in which children temporarily regress before mastering a new developmental milestone. Just before a surge of rapid growth in any line of development, the child’s behavior seems to fall apart. Parents lose their own balance and become alarmed. “People now take this for granted,” said Dr. Joshua Sparrow, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who collaborated with Dr. Brazelton. “But Berry started it before developmental neuroscientists came along to show that he was right.” In 1993, the Brazelton Institute was founded at Boston Children’s Hospital as a way to spread Dr. Brazelton’s findings on babies and children. In 1998, Dr. Brazelton and his colleagues began Touch Points, a clinical program offered at 100 sites around the United States and abroad. (Dr. Sparrow is the director of the program at the Boston hospital.) Touch Point Centers reach out to early-childhood educators and to health care and social-service providers with this message: Before a child makes a new developmental leap, he falls apart. He is going back to gather his strength to take the next leap. If you can help parents understand what is coming, they can anticipate what will happen in normal development. Dr. Brazelton believed that parents visit pediatricians not primarily to treat diseases. Rather, they come with questions about healthy development involving sleep, feeding, toilet training, tantrums and other behaviors. His advice to parents: Learn to read your baby’s language. Look at your baby. He will tell you what he needs. Trust your gut reaction. Parents, he said, need as much support as their babies do. Dr. Brazelton went public with this and other messages in a big way. He was a popularizer, in the tradition of the astronomer Carl Sagan, but his critics said he was too visible, and that he was overly artificial and sunny. Thomas Berry Brazelton Jr. was born on May 10, 1918, in Waco, Tex., to the former Pauline Battle and Thomas Berry Brazelton. He showed an early interest in caring for children, “At every family event,” he recalled in his 2013 memoir, “Learning to Listen: A Life Caring for Children,” “I was put in charge of all nine first cousins while aunts and uncles and grandparents prepared for the big dinner.” To please his grandmother, he added: “I became adept at handling many small children at once. I could keep them amused and safe and keep them from crying for up to two hours at a time. A miraculous feat, I realize today!” By the sixth grade, he had decided on a career in pediatrics — or maybe the stage. He loved acting and singing. At Princeton University, from which he graduated in 1940, he tried out for and was offered a role in a Broadway play with Ethel Merman. His father insisted that he go to medical school instead. He did, graduating from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1943. After an internship at Roosevelt Hospital in New York and a year in the Naval Reserve, Dr. Brazelton began a medical residency in 1945 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He took his pediatric training at Boston Children’s Hospital in 1947 and went on to study child psychiatry at Massachusetts General and the James Jackson Putnam Children’s Center. Dr. Brazelton began a private practice in pediatrics in Cambridge, Mass., in 1950 and was appointed instructor at Harvard Medical School. In 1972, he established the Child Development Unit, a pediatric training and research center at Children’s Hospital. In 1988, he was named clinical professor of pediatrics emeritus at Harvard Medical School and professor of psychiatry and human development at Brown University. Harvard Medical School established the T. Berry Brazelton Chair in Pediatrics in 1995. In 2002, he received the World of Children Award for his achievements in child advocacy. In 2013, President Barack Obama awarded Dr. Brazelton a Presidential Citizens Medal, the nation’s second-highest civilian honor. In addition to his daughter Christina, he is survived by two other daughters, Catherine and Pauline; a son, Thomas III; and five grandchildren. His wife, the former Christina Lowell, who at one time ran an art gallery and served on the boards of several nonprofits, died at 94 at their Barnstable home in 2015. Her father, Alfred Putnam Lowell, was a Boston lawyer and a cousin of the poet Robert Lowell. She was also a descendant of John Lowell, a federal judge appointed by President George Washington. Dr. Brazelton met her at a dinner party at Alfred Lowell’s house in 1949. Smitten, he later asked if he could visit her in New York City, where she worked for the Putnam publishing company. “To bolster my chances,” he wrote in his memoir, “I took along a copy of an avant-garde poetry magazine with her cousin Robert Lowell’s work in it.” “‘Do you read this?’ she asked. “‘Of course,’ I lied.” They were married that year. When it came to their own children, Mrs. Brazelton did not always subscribe to her husband’s child-rearing theories, The Boston Globe reported. “She’d say, ‘I don’t want to hear any advice from you,’” The Globe quoted Dr. Brazelton as saying. “We went back and forth all the time. We argued for 66 years, and I always let her win. It kept everything alive.”",The New York Times
2018,Drake Conquers Another Streaming Service: Twitch,"Drake isn’t content to just break music records anymore. Two months after the rapper set new highs on streaming services for his No. 1 single “God’s Plan,” he upended the gaming community on Wednesday night by showing up on Twitch, the video game streaming platform, to play the survival game Fortnite. Signing on as TheBoyDuddus, Drake formed a team with the professional gamer Tyler Blevins, who goes by Ninja and has the largest audience on Twitch, with 3.4 million followers. The stream was soon trending on Twitter, and it hit around 630,000 concurrent views, blowing away the previous record on a single-player stream of 388,000. The pair were also joined by the rapper Travis Scott and the Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster as players in the game, where teams battle to be the last one standing in an apocalyptic landscape. While running around on grassy knolls and shooting down enemies, Drake said he has been playing Fortnite for a month or two, and uses it as a reprieve from recording sessions: “We stay in the studio for so long, sometimes for 15-20 hours. It’s just nice to take a little mental break.” He also talked about filming his viral “God’s Plan” video, for which he gave out $1 million: “It was really the best time of my life.” Later, the rapper Logic issued a challenge as well: The high-wattage streaming session is another sign of the gaming industry emerging as a major force in mainstream culture. Amazon bought Twitch for $1.1 billion in 2014, as gamer communities were tuning in around the world in numbers that rivaled the average prime-time viewership of some cable networks. Rappers like Post Malone, XXXTentacion and Lil Yachty are increasingly dipping their toes into gaming culture as a place to market their music or interact with fans without a buffer.",The New York Times
2018,"Drawn to a Cause, British Woman Dies Fighting Alongside Kurds in Syria","LONDON — Many young people leading safe, comfortable lives in the West take up causes like the environment or gender equality. Fewer devote themselves to the plight of Kurds in Syria’s brutal civil war. Fewer still travel there to join the fighting, and those who do are usually men. But Anna Campbell, a young woman from southern England, did all of that. Last week, as the Turkish military and its Syrian rebel allies hammered their way into Afrin, in northwestern Syria, Ms. Campbell died for her commitment — the eighth Briton and the first British woman to be killed fighting alongside Kurdish forces. In Britain, Ms. Campbell, 26, was active in causes like animal rights and environmental protection, but until recently, she had no personal connection to the Kurds. Yet she was deeply moved, family and friends said, by the fight to defend an autonomous, mostly Kurdish region in northern Syria, known as Rojava, whose leaders advocate a secular, democratic and egalitarian politics, with equal rights for women. “She was somebody who saw the injustices of the world and the plight of the weak and vulnerable and disempowered, and she also saw the idealism, the amazing utopian vision of Rojava, and she found those two elements irresistible,” her father, Dirk Campbell, said in an interview. “She wanted to prevent that from being stamped out, which Turkey and Syria are trying to do.” The Free Syrian Army, a rebel group, and Turkey declared on Sunday that they had taken control of Afrin, a mostly Kurdish city near the Turkish border that had been held by the People’s Protection Units, the Kurdish-led militia known by the initials of its Kurdish name, Y.P.G. The Kurds appeared to have withdrawn, but the Y.P.G. claimed in a statement that the fight was not over, and that it had only shifted “from direct confrontation war to hit-and-run tactics.” Ms. Campbell, whose mother died several years ago, grew up in East Sussex, in southeastern England. She studied at Sheffield University, but academics did not suit her, her father said, and she dropped out, worked as a blacksmith and trained as a plumber. She traveled to Syria last year, received military and Kurdish-language training, and joined the Women’s Protection Units, or Y.P.J., the all-female military forces that fight alongside the Y.P.G. She dyed her blond hair black, to blend in better, and took a Kurdish name. “I wanted to participate in the revolution of women that is being built up here and fight, and join also the weaponized fight against the forces of fascism and the enemies of the revolution,” she said in a video the Y.P.J. posted on Facebook on Monday. “And so now I’m very happy and proud to be going to Afrin to be able to do this.” “She knew the risk she was facing,” said Ahed Elhendi, an adviser in Washington to the Syrian Democratic Council, the political group that controls northeast Syria and is allied with the Y.P.G. “When Afrin was being shelled by the Turkish Army, she asked to join the fight there many times until she finally made it there.” Mr. Elhendi, who said he met Ms. Campbell last October in Syria, added, “We thought she could be a great asset to voice our dilemma, but her answer was always, she came for resistance, to fight.” The Syrian war, now seven years old, features a complex array of forces. Kurdish-led militias, backed by the United States, are fighting another American ally, Turkey, which claims that the Y.P.G. is an extension of a Kurdish insurgent group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, also known as the P.K.K., that has been labeled a terrorist organization. The Kurds are also fighting the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which is backed by Russia, Iran and Iranian-sponsored Shiite militias, and has increasingly reasserted control over the country. Each of those factions has, to varying degrees, also fought the Islamic State group, now all but eliminated as a military force in Syria. And other rebel groups round out the picture, including Sunni Islamists who oppose all the major parties. Mr. Campbell, 67, a musician, said he tried to talk his daughter out of going to Syria, knowing that she could be hurt or killed. “In retrospect, I could have made the argument more forcefully, but I think she would have dug her heels in even harder,” he said. “I knew she was tough, but I never saw her as pointing a gun,” said Mr. Campbell, who learned of his daughter’s death on Sunday. “Now the bottom has dropped out of my world.”",The New York Times
2018,"Drilling the Great Australian Bight: Hoping for Jobs, but Fearing a Spill","PORT LINCOLN, Australia — It has been called Australia’s answer to the Galápagos: a stretch of rich, pristine ocean facing the Antarctic that is home to calving whales and teeming fisheries that have turned local boat captains into tuna barons. But now the waters, known here as the Great Australian Bight, or just the Bight for short, have drawn a different sort of resource industry: The Norwegian oil giant Statoil plans to start drilling by the end of 2019 to tap what experts call one of the world’s great remaining natural gas reserves. Here in a country built on resource extraction, where the fossil fuel industry has a long history of political connections that often give it priority over the environment, people fear that this haven for some of the most unusual marine life in the world will be damaged and put at even greater risk from a spill. “Our fishing industry, our tourism industry, our lifestyle, our local food and our wildlife all depend on a pristine coastline,” said a marine adventure company employee, Elise Lavers, while swimming with endangered Australian sea lions. She called the Bight one of the world’s best-kept environmental secrets. “We have too much at stake to allow oil drilling in the Great Australian Bight to occur,” Ms. Lavers said. The pressure to seek an oil and gas bonanza is especially intense because of local politics: Much of the Bight extends along the state of South Australia, a struggling postindustrial area where talk of jobs and economic growth dominated a recent local election. Whether to open the Bight to drilling was a crucial issue in the election this past week to select lawmakers for the State Parliament. Leading politicians at the national level have chimed in over the years, with pro-growth candidates arguing that the oil and gas industry would create jobs and wealth in South Australia and beyond for decades to come. “Statoil’s decision to undertake exploration is good news for the South Australian economy,” said Matt Canavan, a conservative senator from the state of Queensland. Even though pro-drilling candidates won in hard-fought races, plans to extract natural gas here still have to be approved by Australia’s offshore oil and gas drilling regulator. Statoil insists that exploration will be safe. Australia has reached its 27th consecutive year without a recession by supplying energy and raw materials like iron ore to the manufacturing economies of Asia, and particularly China. Opening the Bight to drilling would help Australia stay on track to eclipse Qatar as the world’s largest exporter of natural gas by 2020. But opposition to the drilling plan highlights the limitations of relying so heavily on the exploitation of natural resources and their export. The plan has met surprisingly strong resistance, despite the need for jobs in a region where manufacturing used to employ one in five workers. Six town councils have raised objections to the drilling. Communities on Australia’s southern coast are questioning whether the government can justify putting at risk a unique marine wilderness area that supports the country’s most valuable fisheries and a tourism industry worth more than $1 billion. The term “bight” is related to the words “bend” and “bow,” and it refers to the crescent shape of a bay, with a curve shallow enough that mariners in a square-rigged ship could sail out in a single tack, regardless of wind direction. Its shared pronunciation with “bite” is a coincidence, although from space, it does look as though a giant bit into the southern coast of Australia. The bay runs for more than 700 miles, lined by the longest stretch of sea cliffs in the world. Port Lincoln, a small seaside town of around 16,000 where sealing and whaling reaches back to the 1820s, is the main jumping-off point for access to the Bight. Today, the enormous wealth that it continues to bring is evident in the mansions that dot its coast — homes of the tuna barons who have made millions from selling to Japan, where sushi chefs pay top dollar for Australian tuna. “There’s potential for an oil spill that would be catastrophic for the industry and other industries along the coast,” said Robbie Staunton, marine operations manager at Stehr Group, one of Australia’s leading seafood companies. Computer modeling by the British oil company BP, which withdrew in 2016 from its plan to drill in the Bight, projected that an accident similar to the Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 could cause environmental damage along a wide stretch of the southern Australian coastline. This raised local concerns, particularly because the Bight’s waters are deeper, rougher and more remote than those of the Gulf of Mexico. The projection also raised another problem: whether Australia was even equipped to deal with an accident at an offshore drilling platform. The equipment needed to contain a blowout by capping the flow of oil is thousands of miles away in Singapore, and would take up to 35 days to put in place. “History shows that the risks are often substantial,” said Kirsten Rough, a researcher for the tuna industry for more than two decades. There are also environmental risks in the techniques used to locate the oil and gas before drilling begins. Seismic surveys to find the undersea deposits rely on loud explosions that, according to researchers, could drive fish away — especially the tuna that matter most to the area. Fishermen say they have already noticed disruptions in the movements of tuna since the surveys began. Others in the fishing industry, though, are more resigned to sharing the waters with drilling rigs. Though initially opposed to the drilling, Hagen Stehr said the focus now should shift to making sure that its impact is limited. This would include ensuring that seismic surveys are not conducted during the times of year when the hauls of fish are the largest. “You can’t stop the development in the Bight,” said Mr. Stehr, one of the town’s best-known tuna barons, in his Port Lincoln office, surrounded by photographs of himself with former prime ministers. “What right have we got to have exclusive rights?” asked Mr. Stehr, a native of Germany who started fishing tuna by hand after jumping ship in Port Lincoln in 1960. “South Australia is on its knees.” Others worry that drilling will push a fragile environment past its limit. “The Great Australian Bight is Australia’s Galápagos,” said Jeff Hansen, who led a ship from the environmental activist group Sea Shepherd, which docked in the state this month to persuade politicians to protect the Bight. “Risking it in a push to expand the fossil fuel industry is the height of irresponsibility,” he said. Many locals harbor deep suspicions about the drilling. They describe a lack of transparency about deals between politicians and big business that has led to a mood of distrust, and a sense of defeat. “You know you’ll be told this is safe as can be,” said Brendan Guidera, an owner of Pristine Oysters in Coffin Bay, a sleepy coastal town near Port Lincoln. “When there’s so much money behind something like this, you don’t necessarily trust everything you’re told,” he said. Oyster growers worry that a spill would be devastating for their industry as well. Coffin Bay oysters are favored by top restaurants across Australia. Rob Kerin, head of the association that represents the state’s oyster industry, said, “You’ve got to look at the worst-case scenario, and the worst-case scenario doesn’t look good for us.” An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the origins of the Great Australian Bight’s name. “Bight” is a nautical term referring to the characteristic bend of the bay; the name does not arise from its bitelike shape.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Driverless Car Technology,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Woman’s Death in Arizona Casts a Pall on Driverless Car Testing” (front page, March 20): Dry weather. Wide roads. Little traffic. An emergency backup driver at the wheel. Even under these optimal conditions, an autonomous vehicle ran down and killed Elaine Herzberg as she walked with her bicycle on Sunday night in Tempe, Ariz. Autonomous vehicles may be alluring, but we’re not ready for them, and clearly they’re not ready for us. As pointed out in “How Driverless Vehicles See the World” (news article, March 20), the dominant technology — lidar, or light-detection and ranging devices — “works pretty well” at low speeds when the signals of multiple autonomous cars don’t interfere with one another. Because of lidar’s limitations, other detection technologies — cameras, radar, GPS — are loaded onto driverless cars. Even then, tragedy strikes. While engineers work out the gaping holes in driverless technology, let’s remind ourselves that ordinary humans are doing better than pretty well at navigating some 3.2 trillion miles of America’s roads every year. Meanwhile, let’s turn our focus to upgrading sorely neglected mass transit systems that can reduce the traffic hazards on our most crowded roads and highways. PHILIP WARBURG, NEWTON, MASS.

2018,Driving Test Challenge,"Wordplay WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today’s crossword is brought to us by the J.A.S.A. crossword class, run by the Jewish Association Serving the Aging in New York City. Open to anyone over the age of 55 in the New York City area, the class outlines the basic principles of crossword puzzle construction, beginning with basic crossword history and then focusing on how to come up with a theme, designing a usable grid and creating the fill. At the end of the semester, the group constructs one final puzzle to submit to The New York Times and, while there is no guarantee that the submission will be published, this is the J.A.S.A. class’s 14th puzzle for The Times. That’s a pretty good track record. For more information about this class and the “Sundays at J.A.S.A.” series, see the bottom of today’s column. A small group of New York Times constructors have taught the class at any given time, but it is currently shepherded by Natan Last and Andy Kravis. We have pairings of circled letters in this 16x15 grid, and the fact that they’re paired escaped me until I had the first two filled in. That made the theme and its revealer at 57A emerge slowly, which is just the way I like them (slowly emergent, that is). I tumbled to the whole thing just before I got to the revealer, making for a very pleasant “Aha!” moment for this midweek puzzle. We’re relearning PARALLEL PARKING today and, by the time I was finished, all the car makes in the circled letters were “parked” neatly next to each other. For example, inside the entries at 13- and 16A, the circled letters spell out AUDI and FORD. There are only two more parking jobs in today’s grid. Be careful, and don’t forget to turn your wheel all the way to the right. In real life, when the cars are parallel, that’s just the beginning of our flashbacks to high school Driver’s Ed, but I liked the way having the cars parallel to each other signaled the revealer. And there’s a lot of admirable fill in the grid. I liked CLAUDIUS (clue it as “Hamlet” or “I, Claudius,” I don’t care. I love both the Shakespearean play and the Robert Graves book), UP FOR DISCUSSION (which I was surprised was not a debut, but it has been used only once before, in 2005), IT’S HOPELESS, TEN PENNY, AW RATS, DON’T EVEN, SHONDA (also a “once before”), LET ME SEE and OH MY LORD. Adding to the fun of the theme and the fill was some very clever cluing. 1A: Does anyone really put on makeup to go to the beach? This was a clever clue: “Beach makeup” might sound like it’s referring to cosmetics, but it’s actually hinting at the makeup of the beach, which is (mostly) SAND. 8A: These aren’t your average “Heads of families.” These are the heads of organized crime families, and they are called CAPOS, which means “bosses” in Italian. 19A: You have to admit this one is cute. “That’s amoray!” is a take off on the song “That’s Amore,” but we’re talking EELs here, not love. 22A: This was a tough one for me, and I’ve seen a lot of wordplay. At first I thought we were talking about the first letter of the word “dates” (the clue is “D as in dates?”), and then my mind drifted to letter grades. You definitely don’t want to get a D in dating. But that made little sense, so I moved on to thinking about years in the calendar. The word DOMINI is the D in “anno Domini,” or A.D. 29A: I had most of this one filled in and guessed TEAROOMS, but it took me a moment to understand how they could be “Cozy places?”, not that I’m disparaging TEAROOMS in the least. I’m sure they’re very cozy. But today we are talking about tea cozies, those covers for teapots that help keep the tea warm. 33-/40-/47A: Lots of nails in today’s puzzle. And all this time I thought they were held together with glue. 50A: Did you have TRA LA LA before SHA LA LA? Me too. 7D: A very common crossword trick, for those of you just branching out into midweek puzzles. “Start of something?” is a familiar phrase, but we’re being misdirected. We’re supposed to be thinking about the start of the word “something,” which is the letter S, or, when written out, ESS. 8D: O.K., now you’re just torturing me. “The secant’s reciprocal” is COSINE. 12D: “Some heirs” are indeed SONS. I appreciate the inclusive wording. 58D: I tried INC as “Business letters?” before LLC. I saw my mistake when I realized that NET ME SEE was not a thing. 59D: This one made me chuckle. “He’s a doll” refers to KEN, the mercilessly teased partner (or is it ex-partner now?) of Barbie. Natan Last: This puzzle was such a treat to make, even by the standards of the already lovely J.A.S.A. process. We’re joined by new faces, like instructor Andy Kravis up at the lectern, who’s so encyclopedic we barely need to research clues anymore, and new constructors, who are injecting even more humor and breadth into these collaborations. This was one of those puzzles where the students became the teachers — the J.A.S.A. class came up with the revealer, brainstormed the best theme pairs, drew up the skeleton of the grid, and even bailed us out of a bad fill moment: They dropped in OH MY LORD where we’d had OH MY WORD and were coming up empty or trivial [in the surrounding fill]. We were also able to keep a wide open construction with some nice long entries. Hope you all like it! Andy Kravis: Natan summed up my thoughts pretty well! This was my first puzzle with the J.A.S.A. class, and I’m looking forward to making many more with them. Almost finished solving but just need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but now you can take a peek at the answer key. While the answers are free to everyone, the Crossword puzzles require a subscription.

2018,Driving With Assad: Syria’s President Tours a Destroyed Suburb,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — In the video, he’s a soft-spoken man in a blue suit and reflective sunglasses piloting his silver Honda through a traffic circle. The driver happens to be President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and he is taking viewers on a leisurely drive into the heart of his country’s civil war. “We’re going to Ghouta to see the situation,” he says calmly in a video posted online by his office. “We’ll see the armed forces that are fighting and the areas that have been liberated.” For weeks, the international news media have been filled with horrifying images from Syria: wounded children being treated in makeshift hospitals; lines of dead bodies wrapped in white shrouds; throngs of refugees fleeing as the Syrian government’s military offensive in eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held suburb of Damascus. This week, the government hit back with a series of videos showing Mr. Assad visiting the area to congratulate his forces and shake hands with cheering residents, some of whom held up their children so he could kiss them on the cheek. “You are the sons of our country,” he said in one video. “We will protect all the people of Ghouta.” In bypassing the news media, Mr. Assad delivered an alternative view of the war, one in which he is assured and in charge, casually cruising past bombed-out buildings, often driving with just two fingers, an elbow propped casually out the window. It is a world in which his opponents are all terrorists and his troops all heroes. “In these areas, every meter has a drop of blood from a Syrian fighter,” he says in one video. “A hero among heroes.” While other Arab leaders have aggrandized themselves with great wealth or military parades, Mr. Assad has cultivated a man-of-the-people image, a Syrian Everyman who loves his country and its people. In his simple Honda sedan, he speaks to an unidentified videographer documenting him from the passenger seat, with no other aides or security measures visible to the camera. In 2016, he paid a similar visit to another Damascus suburb, Daraya, after his forces had starved and bombed its rebellious population into submission. In that video, he drove a silver Hyundai. This time, as he drives by a line of buildings destroyed in combat, he speaks of feeling a mix of pride in the advances of his forces and of sadness for what the war had done to civilians, especially children. “The thing that is painful is to see is people who were forced without a choice because of the war, because of the terrorists, to leave their homes and to live for days in open areas,” he said. He does not hint at his own role in the war, his forces’ history of inflicting tremendous violence and the costs to civilians his painful sieges have exacted on rebel-held areas. In eastern Ghouta, about 1,500 civilians have been killed since the Syrian government began its campaign to take the area last month, and some 20,000 civilians have fled in recent days. Witnesses have described scenes of families bombarded by government warplanes and artillery as they tried to flee, leaving the wounded lying in the street. There were no scenes like that in Mr. Assad’s video. At one stop, he spoke to a crowd of soldiers, telling them that they were playing a crucial role in a global battle against terrorists. “Each bullet that you fire, when you hit a terrorist, when you get rid of a terrorist, you are changing the world system,” he said, as the booms of an ongoing battle punctuated his speech. Every tank driver who goes one meter forward, he is changing the map of world politics.”",The New York Times
2018,"Drones Spy Caribou on a Treacherous, Icy Crossing","Watching the herd from above offered a more complete view of the animals’ varying behaviors, and could suggest insights into other migratory species. Every autumn, caribou gather along the shores of Victoria Island in the Canadian Arctic and wait. Once the temperature drops and the ice gets thick enough, dozens of them cross together to mainland Canada. There, if they make it, they will spend the winter breeding before heading back to birth and raise their young on the island. The Inuit, who share an intimate connection with these caribou, have always said that a few lead and the rest follow along this treacherous Arctic journey. Now, new technology is confirming this centuries-old indigenous wisdom. In November 2015, scientists led by Andrew Berdahl at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and Colin Torney at the University of Glasgow in Scotland deployed drones to film this migration. With computer vision they analyzed the footage, identifying every individual and tracking their assorted behaviors as they moved together. They found that indeed, caribou paid close attention to the directional cues of their neighbors ahead of them. And despite earlier research models suggesting individuals in migrating groups all act the same, the researchers confirmed what the Inuit knew — some caribou led, while others followed along. The results, published Monday in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, may help inform conservation efforts for island caribou, which already face other pressures that have been exacerbated by warming temperatures and increased ship traffic along their icy migratory routes. Their methods may also contribute to the study of other animal migrations in the wild. There are even lessons for your average human: In scary situations, it’s nice to have others around. Scientists have known that social interactions of organisms from bacteria to humans influence the decisions they make as species. But it’s difficult to study these interactions among migrating animals. Dolphin and Union caribou, as this endangered population is called, provide an interesting case study because they’re different from other caribou. They’re less social — except during this sea ice migration. The benefits they gain from interacting with one another during their crossing have been a mystery. Scientists have studied caribou migrations by counting passing animals, taking aerial photos and attaching GPS collars to track the movements of a few members. But drone videos offer a more complete view of the varying behaviors of migrating caribou. The researchers in this study were able to observe how sex or age influenced interactions while traveling, looking at who stayed close to whom and which animals started movements and which copied. They discovered, for example, that calves rely on social cues and stay close to others, but mature bulls were more autonomous. “If you want to understand the full picture you have to consider the social context, because in this group of moving species, the interactions between individuals can be just as important as the traits of individuals themselves,” said Dr. Berdahl. [READ: Hunting Moose in Canada to Save Caribou From Wolves] He thinks that when these caribou come together, they can better sense and respond to the perilous ice they cross. It’s called collective sensing. “What’s interesting is that they can achieve collective behavior — migrating together — without any individual deciding that’s what they need to do or making any global assessments,” said Deborah Gordon, who studies collective behavior in ants at Stanford University and was not involved in this study. “That’s how nature works at many scales — from the cells in our bodies to herds of caribou.” Understanding such collective behavior is important as the environments migratory animals live in change with the climate and human activity. And these new technologies can contribute to ongoing caribou conservation efforts said Kim Poole, a wildlife biologist at Aurora Wildlife Research in British Columbia who has studied island caribou sea ice crossings. [READ: America’s Gray Ghosts: The Disappearing Caribou] In the future, combining drone footage of behavior with high resolution maps of terrain may offer clues to how these animals and others deal with danger. “So many migratory species travel in groups,” said Dr. Berdahl. “Nature’s had countless years to discover and perfect these algorithms for controlling distributed systems,” and now it’s time we uncover and use them. ____ Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.

2018,Dropbox Chief to Join Elite Ranks of Idea-to-I.P.O. Founders,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Drew Houston played computer games like Starcraft in high school, he made some changes so the games ran more smoothly on his friends’ computers. “He created this one little application, and it would basically display everybody’s shared files, and then if you clicked on a file, it would go ahead and ask everyone else on the network if they wanted to download it as well,” said Andrew Croswell, a friend of Mr. Houston’s from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, Mass. Mr. Houston, now 35, has since taken a version of that same concept and turned it into Dropbox, an online file storage and collaboration company that has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007. Last month, Dropbox filed to go public, and when it does Mr. Houston will become the newest member of a small club of tech founders who steered a start-up all the way to Wall Street. (The company is expected to set a price range for its offering as soon as this coming week and trade on the stock market by the end of the month.) In the process, Mr. Houston is also set to become the next bona fide tech billionaire. According to Dropbox’s initial public offering filing, he owns 25 percent of the company, making him its single largest shareholder. Dropbox was last privately valued at about $10 billion, meaning Mr. Houston’s stake was worth about $2.5 billion on paper. Whether Mr. Houston successfully takes Dropbox public will be closely watched, with other privately held tech companies like Uber and Airbnb also edging toward an I.P.O. Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, is unprofitable, and Mr. Houston now has to navigate through a challenging time, both guiding his company around the tech giants that are squeezing into its space and adapting his frat guy persona to a changing culture. “He’s maybe one of the last ones of a very un-C.E.O.-like C.E.O.,” said Jeffrey Mann, a vice president at research firm Gartner, who follows the file-sharing and collaboration industry. “He was technical. He started out by coding. Most start-ups now when they get to that size, founders like him get pushed aside for someone with a finance or management background. But he managed to stay there.” Dropbox said Mr. Houston was unavailable for comment, citing the quiet period before an I.P.O. But according to interviews with more than a dozen people, Mr. Houston — a private man with a love of 1990s rock and business books — built his company with an easygoing management style and a dry sense of humor, which helped him deal with the bumps along the way. Mr. Houston grew up in Acton, a suburb outside Boston, the oldest of three children. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a librarian, noticed early on that Mr. Houston was precocious and encouraged him to explore his interest in computers, but did not want him skipping grades. “His parents wanted him to stay in first grade for socialization, and they didn’t want to use the term gifted,” said Claudia Couto, who taught at Mr. Houston’s elementary school and tutored him privately. She is now retired. As a middle schooler, Mr. Houston beta-tested computer games looking for security flaws. He worked for a robotics start-up as a teenager and repaired computers for neighbors. He got a perfect score on the SAT and attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001. At M.I.T., he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which he has said helped him learn how to build a corporate culture. “My first management experience was being rush chairman for my fraternity, and I learned a bunch of things,” Mr. Houston said in a New York Times interview in 2016. “You deal with a lot of the same broad questions — who do we want to be as an organization, what kind of culture do we want, what kind of people are we looking for? — that you do when you’re starting a company.” After his sophomore year, he took a year off and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with one of his former high school teachers, Andrew Crick. Upon returning to M.I.T., Mr. Houston decided to learn as much about business as he could, plowing through business books from a chair he set up on the roof of his fraternity, he has said. A Pearl Jam fan, Mr. Houston in 2005 formed a 1990s cover band called Angry Flannel, which played at venues around Boston. On a bus one day from Boston to New York, Mr. Houston forgot his USB flash stick. Frustrated, he started coding what would be the foundation of Dropbox. He became less interested in Accolade, which closed. “He was really interested in entrepreneurship, which was not a common trajectory for M.I.T. students,” said Kyle Vogt, 32, chief executive of the self-driving car company Cruise Automation, who met Mr. Houston at an M.I.T. entrepreneurship club event. “The default back then was to stay in Boston or go to New York and work for a hedge fund.” In 2007, Mr. Houston entered Dropbox into the Boston program of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. Paul Graham, who was running Y Combinator, said Mr. Houston needed a co-founder fast. Mr. Vogt referred Mr. Houston to Arash Ferdowsi, an M.I.T. student. Within two weeks, Mr. Ferdowsi became Dropbox’s co-founder; he owns a 10 percent stake of the company. The duo worked in Cambridge, Mass., but struggled to land more funding. In August 2007, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved to San Francisco to get closer to the start-up scene. A month later, they raised $1.2 million from investors including Sequoia Capital. Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved into an apartment building in the city’s North Beach neighborhood. It was known as the Y Scraper because of how many Y Combinator company founders lived and worked there. Mr. Houston and Mr. Vogt later became roommates. “To this day, he still likes to have people over to his apartment and do jam sessions,” Mr. Vogt said. Mr. Houston also became close to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. In 2013, Mr. Houston joined Mr. Zuckerberg as a co-founder of FWD.us, a group that mobilizes the tech industry for immigration reform. Running Dropbox, Mr. Houston was at first determined to aim its product — which lets people store and access their files in the cloud — at consumers rather than businesses. He spent lavishly on employee perks, totaling $25,000 a year per person by 2016. The company once paid $60,000 for a five-foot chrome panda for its headquarters, becoming a symbol of start-up excess. Then hurdles sprang up. In 2011, a security researcher complained to the Federal Trade Commission about the way Dropbox encrypted files. Mr. Houston called dealing with the criticism “a rite of passage.” Dropbox also developed a reputation as an unwelcoming workplace for women. “Some of the things they’ve been struggling with are how to balance Dropbox being a fun place to work with accusations of having a frat boy atmosphere,” Mr. Mann said. Dropbox’s business evolved in 2014 after Mr. Houston hired Dennis Woodside, a former Google executive, as chief operating officer. Now its products are primarily used for work, with businesses paying a subscription fee for the platform. A rival company, Box, which was aimed at businesses, went public in 2015. “From Day One, Dropbox has been an incredibly user-friendly product — which is a big reason why it spread virally — but it also took the company too long to realize the money was in being a business-focused company, not a consumer-focused one,” said Ben Thompson, the analyst behind the influential tech newsletter Stratechery. In 2015, investors began questioning whether high-priced start-ups were living up to their skyrocketing valuations. Dropbox, already privately valued at $10 billion, was marked down in value by some large institutional investors. Dropbox instilled more financial discipline. In 2016, employees lost many in-office perks. (The panda remained. A note posted nearby said it would serve as “a reminder” to be thoughtful about spending.) Whether Dropbox can compete against behemoths like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google, which all provide cloud storage, remains a question. “Here you have somebody who’s literally in competition with all four, except Facebook,” said Hadi Partovi, an early Dropbox investor. But he added that Mr. Houston’s even-keeled demeanor had allowed the company to work with competitors like Microsoft and Google. Today, Mr. Houston lives in the Millennium Tower, a glass high-rise in the South of Market neighborhood. His apartment floors are stone and the furniture is minimalist and modern. In the living room, he has built a midsize stage to perform music. He has a house in Hawaii where he vacations. He is a bachelor and, his friends said, lives like one. “He never cooks. He’s a snack guy all the way if that makes any sense,” Mr. Croswell said. “He definitely wants a family.” On weekends, he and his friends around the country still put on their headsets and play video games together. “He doesn’t have to do any of the hacks anymore,” Mr. Croswell said. “Software companies all fixed that kind of stuff.”",The New York Times
2018,"Dropbox Priced at $21 a Share in I.P.O., Valuing Company at $9.2 Billion","Dropbox is the latest so-called unicorn to trot into the public markets. Some 36 million shares in the company, based in San Francisco, were sold Thursday for $21 apiece, higher than the range of $18 to $20 a share that the company’s investment bankers had recently envisioned. Founded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science students, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox sells software subscriptions that let users collaborate and share files online. Until now, it was financed by private investors — including venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners — who valued the start-up at $9.4 billion, according to the research firm CB Insights. That large valuation earned Dropbox the coveted “unicorn” designation, which applies to start-ups valued at more than $1 billion. The share sale on Thursday gave Dropbox a market value of about $9.2 billion. The shares are expected start trading Friday on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol DBX. The debut comes during a period of market turmoil. On Thursday, stock market indexes plunged more than 2 percent as investors fretted about the prospect of a trade war between the United States and China. Dropbox’s initial public offering could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public, letting their early investors and founders cash in on huge investment gains that currently only exist on paper. Dropbox has never turned an annual profit, but the company has achieved annual sales growth of more than 30 percent in recent years, with its revenue topping $1 billion annually. Its losses have narrowed to $112 million last year from $326 million in 2015, and the company says it is moving toward becoming profitable. The demand for Dropbox’s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. Dropbox’s debut is a bright spot for the tech sector, where the expectation of greater government regulation in the United States and Europe has hurt companies’ shares in recent days.",The New York Times
2018,"Dropbox Shares Leap in I.P.O., and Silicon Valley Smiles","Dropbox, the file-sharing company and Silicon Valley darling, had a strong market debut Friday, a reassuring sign for the technology industry and for the investors who have billions locked up in other highly valued but privately held start-ups. Shares of San Francisco-based Dropbox, which had sold 36 million shares at $21 each on Thursday night, rose 36 percent in the first day of trading. That pushed Dropbox’s market value to $11.2 billion, above where it had been valued in the private markets. The initial public offering arrived at a dicey time. Stock markets have been on a roller coaster, with investors anxious about the threat of inflation, possible trade wars and geopolitical risks. The technology industry in particular has been buffeted by the prospect of tougher government regulation. Giant tech companies helped drive another sharp sell-off Friday. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index tumbled 2 percent, with both Facebook and Amazon falling more than 3 percent. The S.&P. is down more than 3 percent this year. But the strong reception for Dropbox, which sells subscriptions to software that lets users collaborate and share files online, suggests that the public markets remain willing to offer a crucial exit point for early-stage investors in the largest private Silicon Valley start-ups, even amid broader concerns about large tech companies. “I think the success of Dropbox’s I.P.O. shows that great companies that are built to last can still access the I.P.O. window, despite a week of incredible volatility and distraction about global trade,” said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and partner at Sequoia Capital, the large venture capital firm that was one of Dropbox’s early investors. Tapping the large amounts of capital in the public markets is becoming more important to such investors. Over the last decade, hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into the venture capital industry. Those funds were then invested into a variety of young companies in the hope of finding the next Facebook or Google among a sea of flops. The influx of cash fueled the tech economy. Between 2006 and 2016, the last year with available data, economic output in the metropolitan area that roughly corresponds to Silicon Valley rose more than 5 percent a year, while the average growth rate in American metro areas was 1.2 percent. And venture capital money meant that highly valued start-ups — “unicorns,” in Silicon Valley parlance — were able to remain private for longer without turning to the public markets for fund-raising. That posed a risk for venture capital firms and other investors, whose stakes had gained large amounts of value on paper but weren’t easily liquidated. There are 236 unicorns with a combined private market valuation in excess of $800 billion, according to CB Insights, a market research firm. They include some of the highest-profile young companies in American business — names such as Uber, Airbnb and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Given the huge values attached to those companies — Uber alone is valued at roughly $68 billion — access to the capital available in public markets has become all the more important. The public markets enable the companies to raise money to accelerate growth and, sometimes just as important, to provide a way for their early investors to cash out. Since 2014, the “exits” by companies backed by venture capital, either through initial public stock offerings or acquisitions by other companies, have slowed. As a result, the offering for Dropbox — along with the successful recent initial public offerings of other young companies — is good news for investors with large gains locked up in private companies. Founded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science students, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox was backed by prominent venture investors in Silicon Valley, including Sequoia and Accel Partners. It has never turned an annual profit, but strong sales growth in recent years has pushed revenue above $1 billion annually. “Today is the result of a lot of long-term investments paying off,” Mr. Houston said. “We were able to get funding and achieve a lot of the goals where you formerly had to be a public company to do it.” Dropbox’s solid performance in its inaugural day of trading adds momentum to what has already been a strong start for the I.P.O. market this year. Roughly $12.9 billion had been raised in 43 offerings listed in the United States through Thursday, the strongest start since 2014, according to the market research firm Dealogic. Another hotly awaited offering is the music-streaming service Spotify. The company has filed to sell shares on the public markets on April 3. And last week, shares of an internet security company, Zscaler, another unicorn, soared more than 100 percent on their first day of trading. Such first-day pops aren’t uncommon. The investment banks that lead I.P.O.s often try to engineer those leaps in order to generate positive publicity about the company’s prospects. The favorable reception on the first day doesn’t guarantee a promising future for any company, even a highly valued Silicon Valley offering. Last year, shares of Snap, the company behind the popular Snapchat app, surged 44 percent on the first day of trading. Since then, it has struggled to stay above its offering price of $17 a share. Another highly valued start-up, the meal-delivery company Blue Apron, went public at $10 a share in June and is now trading at roughly $2.",The New York Times
2018,"Dropbox, Valued Privately at $10 Billion, Could Droop by 25% in I.P.O.","Dropbox, the online file storage company, is poised to hold one of the year’s most highly awaited stock market debuts. But whether investors think the technology darling is more valuable as a publicly traded company or as a privately held start-up is debatable. The San Francisco company said Monday that it planned to raise as much as $648 million in its initial public offering, pricing its shares between $16 and $18 each. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at roughly $7.5 billion, including restricted stock units and options — well below the $10 billion it commanded during its last private fund-raising round. The lower potential valuation suggests that public market investors don’t share nearly the same enthusiasm for technology companies that venture capitalists once did, raising questions for a horde of other high-priced start-ups that are edging their way toward the public markets. Dropbox attained its $10 billion valuation as a privately held company more than four years ago, in a different age for Silicon Valley, when many start-ups raced to collect as high a valuation as they could. Since then, companies have been more reserved. Many learned that stretching for every last dollar of valuation could make it more difficult to raise additional capital in the future, or to attract and keep employees with stock grants. “It’s a high-quality asset that was overpriced,” Venky Ganesan, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures, said of Dropbox. His firm does not have ties to the company. Dropbox appears set to join a relatively small group of “down round” initial public offerings, in which a firm’s value is lower than it was when the firm raised money privately. That group includes the meal kit delivery service Hello Fresh and the database software provider MongoDB, according to the research firm CB Insights. Dropbox could still hit that $10 billion valuation over time, assuming its stock price rises after it goes public. A spokeswoman for Dropbox declined to comment. Many investors are nonetheless expected to flock to Dropbox, in a year that is likely to be busy for stock market debuts. Dropbox and Spotify, the music-streaming giant, which is planning its own listing, could presage a series that eventually includes the likes of Uber and Airbnb. The market for initial offerings this year is already proving robust, with 29 so far, up 61 percent from a year ago, according to the advisory firm Renaissance Capital. Monday’s filing preceded Dropbox’s road show to pitch its offering to potential investors. As the company’s executives and their advisers begin to crisscross the country in a series of meetings, their goal is to convince would-be buyers that its stock will perform more like Facebook’s, which has risen enormously in recent years, and less like Snap’s, whose stock is down 34 percent since its debut last year. Dropbox is likely to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market — under the ticker symbol DBX — by the end of next week. Going public would be the biggest accomplishment yet for Dropbox since it was founded in 2007. Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, two students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, created Dropbox as a workaround for not having USB flash drives handy, and the company has become one of the giants in the business of sharing files online. Though analysts have long worried about the prospects of independent file-storage providers like Dropbox and Box, a competitor that went public three years ago, the companies have shown that they can survive. “When you’ve really honed your focus and how to differentiate yourself, you can do well,” Aaron Levie, Box’s chief executive, said in an interview. Dropbox’s business has grown rapidly over the past three years, reaching $1.1 billion in sales last year. Though the company continues to lose money, it has reduced the red ink on its books, losing $111.7 million last year. Though Dropbox may have fallen short of its last fund-raising valuation in the initial offering process thus far, some in Silicon Valley said the company’s future looked bright. “The Dropbox business is way better than anyone expected,” Mr. Ganesan said. “My feeling is that no one should be focused on what the short-term valuation of the company is.” Even Mr. Levie of Box — whose company also went public at a lower valuation than its last private fund-raising round, only to eventually trade above that level — said investors should not worry too much about at what level Dropbox goes public. “I’ve learned not to put too much stock in the pre-I.P.O. pricing dynamic,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Dropbox’s First-Day Pop Should Give Investors Pause: DealBook Briefing,"Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Dropbox’s valuation gives investors reason for caution. • Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading. • President Trump signs spending bill. • GlaxoSmithKline withdrew its bid for Pfizer’s consumer division. • Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid $42 million to settle with N.Y.’s attorney general over trading practices. • How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight be? Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesn’t make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power. Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future. This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox’s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn’t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows. At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year’s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data. Of course, Dropbox’s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap’s did after its I.P.O. last year. Still, Dropbox’s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this. His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019. After Friday’s huge pop, Dropbox’s stock has arguably “priced in” the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria’s forecasts, Dropbox’s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record. What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook’s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox’s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year. — Peter Eavis Dropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price. The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion. At Friday’s close, Dropbox is valued at $12.5 billion Here are some more numbers to put the I.P.O. market into perspective: • So far this year, 38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges, raising $12.8 billion. That’s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters. • The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up, on average, 15%. • The average gain for tech I.P.O. this year is 43%; • Since the start of 2017, shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent. The three best performing I.P.O.s in 2018 • Armo Biosciences (+126 percent) • CueBiopharma (+120 percent) • Menlo Therapeutics (+102 percent) The three worst performing I.P.O.s in 2018 • ADT (-38 percent) • Corporacion America Airports (-39 percent) • Solid Biosciences LLC (-48 percent) The closer investors look at President Trump’s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them. This can be seen in the way the stock market has responded to the trade restrictions, which were announced on Thursday but were flagged a few days earlier. The S.&P. 500 index was down 5.95 percent this week, falling every day but one. And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout, with the S.&P. 500 skidding 2.52 percent on Thursday and 2.1 percent on Friday. We know that Mr. Trump watches the stock market’s response to his policies. He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Will this week’s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China? Mr. Trump sounded unfazed on Friday. “I think the stock market is going to be great,” he said. — Peter Eavis The president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the $1.3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday, avoiding a government shutdown. Early in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress’s failure to fund his long-promised border wall. From this morning: Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT: But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation’s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security — including new technology and repairs to existing barriers — but not Mr. Trump’s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology. (The backstory to the bill: Here’s how Congressional leaders settled lawmakers’ objections.) As Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that provided voter-targeting services to the Trump campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg came under criticism for saying nothing. Finally, on Wednesday he released a statement and sat down for interviews. We asked Paul Pendergrass, a long time corporate communication professional and formerly DealBook’s “Jack Flack” columnist, to offer his insights into the situation: In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives. “I’d be happy to…” he told CNN’s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, “if it’s the right thing to do.” He then went on to offer Facebook’s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings. The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that. He elaborated: The question in Congressional testimony is, “What is the goal?” That’s not a media opportunity. At least it’s not supposed to be. Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they’re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive. So it’s definitely a media opportunity… but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O. If Mr. Zuckerberg wants proof of that, he can ask John Stumpf, the former C.E.O. of Wells Fargo, and the bank’s current chief executive, Tim Sloan, how much information they were asked to provide. He could ask the same of the C.E.O. of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes. For that matter, Mr. Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch. Just last fall Mr. Stretch endured a Senate lashing over the use of Facebook by Russian operatives. When Mr. Zuckerberg is brought in to testify, the committee’s “goal” will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms can’t be trusted to regulate themselves. Mr. Zuckerberg’s goal will be to try to avoid acting in a way that would elevate his role as the designated villain in the story. Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. “I would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,” he told Ms. Segall. After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won’t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology. On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans. Mr. Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, deleted the Facebook pages of both of his companies, the NYT’s Nellie Bowles reports. Mr. Musk growing chorus of tech leaders calling for people to abandon Mr. Zuckerberg’s social network after it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain and misuse data on 50 million users. China’s state-backed funds have a history of stepping in to smooth out swings in the country’s stock market. And so on Friday as China stocks tumbled amid fears of a trade war with the United States, those funds began buying, Bloomberg reports, citing unnamed sources. They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports. Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent. — Stephen Grocer Shares in both retailers are up in premarket trading this morning after Fast Company reported that the two sides are weighing a union. Shares in Kroger were up 4 percent, while those in Target were up over 2 percent. The purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online. But Fast Company cautioned, “The companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward.” And Courtney Reagan of CNBC, citing an unnamed source, threw cold water on the idea: The deals flyaround • Steve Wynn has sold his entire stake in Wynn Resorts, worth $2.1 billion as of Wednesday.

(WSJ) — Michael J. de la Merced Broadcom’s shareholders approved the chip maker’s decision to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. The move is expected to be completed after the market’s close on April 4. The vote comes nearly two weeks after President Trump blocked Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. The decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States. They’re here. President Trump imposed $60 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on Chinese goods. China is threatening tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods like nuts, wine and pork. Now S.&P. 500 futures and markets in Asia and Europe are down this morning, following yesterday’s steep sell-off (which was driven in large part by Boeing). The context: Mr. Trump has made subtext — China is the U.S.’s main economic rival and must be treated as a strategic competitor — text. Few in the U.S. are happy with Beijing’s trade and intellectual property policies. But the world is now watching to see whether the fight turns out to be a spat, or a prolonged and damaging conflict. Peter Eavis’s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China’s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong. On the other tariffs: The E.U. is still waiting for confirmation of exemptions from the imported metals tariffs. They may get quotas instead. Meet Century Aluminum, the tiny manufacturer that pressed for those penalties. Critics’ corner • Stephen Gandel of Gadfly writes, “Trump’s tariffs and especially his protectionist rhetoric threaten to cut more and more of the world off.” • Paul Krugman writes, “America has much less trade leverage over China than Trump imagines, and a trade war with ‘China’ will anger a wider group of countries, some of them close allies.” • The WSJ editorial board writes, “A rising and aggressive China poses considerable risks to world order, but persuading its leaders to conform to trading norms requires more than scattershot tariffs.” • Christopher Beddor of Breakingviews writes, “The sweeping duties and investment restrictions the U.S. president ordered on Thursday in response to intellectual-property theft may prove largely symbolic.” The state’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.

2018,Duke Survives a Battle With the Syracuse Zone,"OMAHA — About seven minutes into the N.C.A.A. tournament game between second-seeded Duke and 11th-seeded Syracuse on Friday, the Blue Devils’ all-world freshman big man, Marvin Bagley III, got the ball inside. He was quickly swallowed by Syracuse’s zone, but somehow managed to kick it out to Duke’s lone senior, Grayson Allen. Allen nailed a 3-pointer and pointed at Bagley in acknowledgment. Aside from brief moments like that one, Duke never really solved Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim’s celebrated 2-3 zone. And maybe it should have, given that Duke now runs the same defense. Still, in a game that was sloppy and came down to the final seconds, Duke held on for a 69-65 win in the round of 16. Even though upsets have spiced up much of this year’s bracket, the Midwest regional final on Sunday will feature Duke against the quadrant’s top seed, Kansas, which outlasted Clemson, 80-76, on Friday night. Duke’s shots from long range did not drop as they typically do. Its 3-point percentage was 19.2 percent, compared with a season average of 38.3 percent. In the second half, the Blue Devils went 2 for 18 from deep. “If you only depend on the 3, then you’re going to be in trouble,” Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said Thursday. “But we’ve been a good rebounding team. And we have good inside players.” That was the key in the second half, when Syracuse actually outscored the Blue Devils. Duke, which had been outrebounded 19-12 in the first half, grabbed 21 rebounds in the second, including 10 on the offensive glass. Bagley led all players with 22 points; his teammate Wendell Carter Jr. led both teams with 12 rebounds and also scored 14 points. The Orange led for much of the first half, as the sophomore guard Tyus Battle led all players with 11 points, 9 of them from 3-pointers. Through the middle of the half, the Orange were 8 for 12 from the field with three offensive rebounds. This was surprising. Boeheim had noted the day before that the Orange’s offense “has struggled, and that gets difficult sometimes. I don’t like to watch it sometimes.” Then again, most observers had predicted that Syracuse — which had been 20-13, with an 8-10 conference record — would miss the N.C.A.A. tournament altogether. Instead the Orange were given the final at-large bid. They won a play-in game against Arizona State, then defeated sixth-seeded Texas Christian and third-seeded Michigan State, the zone confounding one of college basketball’s best teams. Krzyzewski learned the defense while Boeheim served as his Team U.S.A. assistant for a decade, and he deployed it at Duke in 2015 when a young team, dominated by three freshmen, won his and the Blue Devils’ fifth national championship. His team this season is even younger than the 2015 version: The starting five consists of Allen and four freshmen likely to enter the N.B.A. draft in June. The game opened up in the second half. While Duke led by 9 with less than five minutes left, Syracuse hoisted itself back into the game and trailed by just 3 with a minute to go. Though the game seesawed from there, Duke made most of its free throws down the stretch. In the end, the Blue Devils’ 75 percent success rate from the charity stripe in the second half may have been their statistical bright spot.",The New York Times
2018,Duke’s Basketball Managers Strive to Be (What Else?) Elite,"PITTSBURGH — Back and to the left. Back and to the left. The Duke basketball manager charged with carrying Coach Mike Krzyzewski’s clipboard during games has these words planted in his brain, because he must always be in the exact same spot relative to the team’s esteemed leader during timeouts and other stoppages in play. He must be just behind the Hall of Fame coach and slightly to his left so that if Krzyzewski wants the clipboard to draw up a play, he can obtain it with a minimum of thought and a maximum of efficiency. “You always have to make sure the board and marker are ready — uncapped, in the right direction, holding the board out exactly,” Zack Spiera, a senior and this season’s “clipboard guy,” said. It’s the way things are done at Duke: the Coach K way, the right way. Most college basketball teams have student managers. They field rebounds during warm-ups and provide towels during timeouts. But at few programs is being a manager taken quite so seriously as at Duke, where everything related to basketball is taken very seriously. In Krzyzewski’s 38 seasons, the Blue Devils, who play Rhode Island in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament here on Saturday, have made 12 Final Fours and won five national championships. They carry themselves as though these accomplishments are always top-of-mind. That extends to the managers’ ethos, which is so … Duke. “Everything they do is elite,” the freshman guard Alex O’Connell said of the men who fetch balls and towels for him — and as with many managers of men’s teams, they are all men. Duke’s managers are part of the tight-knit family of Coach K managers, present and past. They praise a network of alumni that helps them after they graduate, with former managers now serving in basketball positions everywhere from Harvard to the Oklahoma City Thunder to Duke itself. Krzyzewski pitches recruits on using Duke basketball to set themselves up for life in the sport and beyond. So do the managers. Even Duke managers with no basketball aspirations see the program as a springboard, as opposed to most college basketball managers, for whom the job is a way to get the best ticket in the arena. “With Coach K, I felt like I had the opportunity to learn about excellence and how to build excellence from the ground up,” Spiera said. Ask the managers about their jobs, and they will articulate the ideology of Duke exceptionalism. “I think the culture we have is really special,” Zach Marcus, another senior manager, said. “It’s a testament to Coach K, the program he’s established.” Everything they do is deliberate, specific, thought through. They wear matching uniforms, typically polo shirts, slacks, belts and Nike sneakers. During the opening segment of practices, eight of them line the court — three to a side, one under each basket — with a ball under an arm. During one drill, rebounding is a three-manager job: one under the basket, another in the corner, a third at the top of the arc next to a coach. At halftime, they sprint to the locker rooms to get them ready before players and staff arrive. After games, their duties done, they meet and critique their performance. “I used to come back in there, and I see it now,” said Nolan Smith, a former Duke player who is now a special assistant on the staff. “They meet as a team and talk about areas of improvement.” In-game timeouts are their shining moment. These are like Nascar pit stops. During Thursday’s 89-67 first-round win over Iona, Spiera raced from his seat at the far end of the bench to the first one, pulled it out — creating a passage between the bench’s front and back sides — and placed it facing the bench, so Krzyzewski could sit and face the five players in the game. Then he assumed his clipboard position. It all took about five seconds. After timeouts, the managers rushed to towel off the coaches’ seats, which had just been occupied by sweaty players. If Duke is Rome and the players are the gladiators, or perhaps the generals, then the managers are the Praetorian Guard, the emperor’s personal division. There is no need to clarify who the emperor is in this analogy. Kevin Pauga, Michigan State’s director of basketball operations, was a Spartans manager. He now administers a postseason basketball tournament for team managers. (Duke’s managers did not play the five regular-season games requisite for qualifying, he said.) “Every school handles their managers just a little bit differently,” Pauga said. “Everyone has their nuances, whether it’s tied to a head coach or a specific program.” Many of the Duke managers’ tasks are typical: rebounding during practices; providing towels and Gatorade during games; cleaning up afterward. They will rebound for any player who wants it, at all hours. They text players to remind them about practices; they fetch them if they are in danger of being late. Then there are odder assignments. When the freshman Trevon Duval forgot his sneakers at a hotel before a road game, a manager was dispatched to fetch them. When the former center Marshall Plumlee’s leg cramped up during a home game last season and a muscle roller stick was not to be found, Krzyzewski had Michael Karamardian, now a senior manager, massage Plumlee’s upper leg with his own hands. Coincidentally or not, Karamardian hopes to attend medical school. “It’d be easier to tell you what they don’t do,” the sophomore Marques Bolden said. Managers begin as freshmen by signing up at the annual activities fair on Duke’s East Campus. There has not been a female manager for several years, and a few months ago, Duke’s student newspaper reported that one applicant had complained, citing another female applicant’s belief that women were held to a higher standard. David Bradley, Duke’s director of basketball operations, disputed this, saying, “We’d love to have anyone.” Applications include résumés and cover letters. The first interview requires semiformal attire. The second involves basketball shorts and physical activities: managers, after all, are frequently rebounding and throwing hard chest passes to some of the country’s best players. Duke prefers applicants who were involved in basketball, as a player or a manager, in high school. The program brings on three or four managers per class. They typically spend four years on the job. (There is little attrition.) They travel with the team beginning their junior year. The seniors are in charge, and they share one full scholarship after three years of working without pay (though they may get paid for working summer camps). They know they are mocked on the internet: for making an impromptu privacy tent out of towels as Marvin Bagley III recovered from a poked eye earlier this season; for just constantly running (“Were they slow on filling the Gatorade cooler?” a Kentucky fan wondered). Their response, in standard Duke fashion, is to point to the scoreboard. “At a certain point, you realize you get to be part of the best program, you go to a really good school, some people are going to try to attack you for those things,” Karamardian said. “If you just understand they’re only attacking you because you’re really good at these things, then who really cares?” OpinionElizabeth Anne Brown",The New York Times
2018,"During Holy Week, Explorations of the Divine","Newsbook As hundreds of millions of people prepare to celebrate Easter and Passover, here are three books that reckon with religion and spirituality. WHY I AM A CATHOLICBy Garry Wills390 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. (2002) Half history of the papacy and half investigation of the writer’s faith, Wills’s book is a response to readers who, after he wrote “Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit,” a critique of the Catholic church and its hierarchy, asked why he remained a Catholic. Wills has “never even considered leaving the Church,” he writes, yet he does not present himself as a Catholic missionary. What he delivers instead is a balanced critique and a defense of his view that one can be both devoted to and critical of one’s faith. Our reviewer called this book “candid, richly informative and perfectly timed.” MAN SEEKS GODMy Flirtations With the DivineBy Eric Weiner349 pp. Twelve. (2011) Weiner, a former foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, is compelled to begin his religious exploration when, while he is enduring a medical scare, a nurse asks him: “Have you found your God yet?” Weiner grew up in a family of “gastronomical Jews,” for whom he writes, “ God resided not in Heaven or the Great Void but in the Frigidaire, somewhere between the cream cheese and the salad dressing.” This sentence might give you some indication of the humor with which he narrates his trip, which takes him to places such as Turkey to explore Sufism and the South Bronx, where he spends time with Franciscan monks. THE WISDOM OF SUNDAYSLife-Changing Insights from Super Soul ConversationsBy Oprah Winfrey240 pp. Flatiron Books. (2017) Every week, on her television show “Super Soul Sunday,” Winfrey explores spirituality with a rotating selection of star guests; Arianna Huffington, Shonda Rhimes and Joe Biden have all been guests. Here, she brings together excerpts from those conversations, as well as personal photographs taken in her home in Santa Barbara “where I feel the presence of God, and the connection to All that is greater than myself, most deeply,” she writes in the book’s introduction. She begins most of her “Super Soul Sunday” conversations with the same question: “What does spirituality mean to you?” The replies have helped Winfrey along her spiritual path, and this book explores how this wisdom has stayed with her.",The New York Times
2018,Dylann Roof’s Sister Arrested After Bringing Weapons to School Walkout,"A sister of Dylann Roof, the man who massacred nine black churchgoers in South Carolina in 2015, was arrested on Wednesday for bringing a knife, pepper spray and marijuana to her high school, the authorities said. Morgan Roof, 18, was arrested on drugs and weapons charges at her high school, A.C. Flora, in Columbia, S.C., and taken to a detention center, Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said in a statement. Sheriff Lott said that a school resource officer was informed by an administrator that Ms. Roof had the weapons and drugs. “Roof had also made a social media post on Snapchat which caused alarm to the student body,” Sheriff Lott said. No students were harmed, he said. Ms. Roof’s Snapchat post criticized students who planned to walk out of class to protest gun violence. “I hope it’s a trap and y’all get shot,” it said. “We know it’s fixing to be nothing but black people walkin out anyway.” Ms. Roof was taken to the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center in Columbia, and local media reported that her bond was set at $5,000. It was not immediately clear whether she had been released or if she had a lawyer. Ms. Roof’s parents did not respond to requests for comment. The arrest of Ms. Roof took place as thousands of students at schools across the country participated in a walkout to protest gun violence, in honor of the 17 students and staff members who were shot to death last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. While the Snapchat post was not cited as a reason for Ms. Roof’s arrest, Susan Childs, the principal of A.C. Flora High School, said in a letter to parents on Wednesday that several events on campus had caused concern. She said that the walkout at the school “went well with only a minor verbal disagreement,” but that an unloaded weapon had been recovered and was being investigated by law enforcement. She also said that a report of another weapon had been found to be inaccurate, and that a student had used social media “to post a hateful message.” She did not mention Ms. Roof by name. “The posting was not a threat, but was extremely inappropriate,” Ms. Childs wrote. “That student was dealt with in a swift and severe manner as the posting caused quite a disruption.” Ms. Childs could not be reached for further comment on Thursday. The sheriff’s department said that in a separate case, two 16-year-old students were arrested after a handgun was found on school grounds on Tuesday. Gov. Henry McMaster said on Twitter Wednesday evening that “potential tragedy was avoided” at the school. “In two separate incidents, students and educators reacted quickly to reports of suspicious activity and behavior to their Richland County Sheriff’s Department school resource officer,” he said. Governor McMaster, a Republican, had called the walkout a “shameful” political statement in a television appearance earlier on Wednesday. “It appears that these school children — innocent school children — are being used as a tool by this left-wing group to further their own agenda,” he said. Mr. Roof killed the parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June 2015. The avowed white supremacist opened fire during a Bible study gathering in a long-planned assault. He was found guilty in 2016 of all 33 federal counts against him and has been sentenced to death.",The New York Times
2018,"E.C.B. Shifts Guidance, as Europe Moves Toward Normalcy","FRANKFURT — Political instability in a heavily indebted eurozone country. The prospect of a trade war with the United States. Stock market turmoil. None of it fazed the European Central Bank, which took another small step back from crisis mode on Thursday. The bank’s policymakers, who set monetary policy for the 19-nation euro area, held interest rates steady, but dropped language from their communiqué in which they had promised to ramp up economic stimulus measures again “if the outlook becomes less favorable.” It was a subtle but important change. By omitting the phrase, which it has repeated since December 2016, the central bank was in effect saying that the eurozone was no longer in imminent danger of going up in flames, and that it was time to begin stowing the fire hoses. The expression of confidence came despite warnings from Mario Draghi, the central bank’s president, about trade tensions with the United States. Mr. Draghi, in an obvious reference to President Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, said during a news conference that it was “dangerous” for countries to change the terms of trade unilaterally, rather than through negotiations. The protectionist measures were part of a general diplomatic deterioration, Mr. Draghi added, and could damage the confidence that businesses needed before they would invest in expansion and hiring. “If you put tariffs against your allies,” Mr. Draghi said, “one wonders who the enemies are.” It was the second news conference in a row in which Mr. Draghi had expressed exasperation with the Trump administration. In January, he accused Steven Mnuchin, the U.S. treasury secretary, of violating international agreements by making comments that caused the dollar to fall against the euro, giving American products a price advantage in foreign markets. Still, the European Central Bank’s Governing Council was not alarmed enough by the potential trade war to interrupt its gradual exit from the emergency measures it has used to keep the eurozone from falling apart during a decade of financial and economic turmoil. While Thursday’s communiqué merely omitted a single sentence, and Mr. Draghi sought to downplay the importance of the change, investors appeared to find it significant. Markets reacted swiftly, with the euro jumping as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar, and the yield on the German 10-year bond, the benchmark for the region, rising five basis points. “It’s a tacit acknowledgment that the economic outlook in Europe is rosier than it was,” James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said in a statement. He added, “The reaction should not be overdone. This is an infinitesimal step forwards.” Some analysts had predicted that the central bank would make no changes in the language it uses to communicate its intentions to financial markets, in light of a confused election result in Italy. On Sunday about half of Italians voted for populist candidates on the left and right, and left no party with a clear mandate to form a government. There is now very little chance that the country will make the sweeping changes needed to break its economy out of prolonged stagnation. Its political deadlock and economic doldrums are a threat to the rest of the common currency area. Italy’s government debt, measured as a percentage of economic output, is among the highest in the world and, in Europe, second only to Greece’s. But Italy also has the eurozone’s third-largest economy, with output 10 times that of Greece, making it a far bigger danger to the region’s financial stability if investors begin to doubt the government’s solvency. “We have to bury the hope that Italy will catch up with Germany and France with reforms,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German bank, said over lunch with reporters in Frankfurt on Tuesday. “Italy will more likely worsen its ability to carry its debt.” The European Central Bank was also unfazed by the ups and downs of global stock markets since the Governing Council last met on monetary policy. Mr. Draghi pointed out that the market turmoil was centered on the United States and “it was pretty short.” As expected, the Governing Council opted on Thursday to leave monetary policy unchanged. Interest rates will remain at a record low level. There is a faction on the Governing Council that is worried that inflation, now dormant, could get out of hand if the central bank waits too long to stop its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a form of money printing intended to stimulate the economy. That faction has been in the minority, but appeared to win the upper hand on Thursday.",The New York Times
2018,E.P.A. Prepares to Roll Back Rules Requiring Cars to Be Cleaner and More Efficient,"The Trump administration is expected to launch an effort in coming days to weaken greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards for automobiles, handing a victory to car manufacturers and giving them ammunition to potentially roll back industry standards worldwide. The move — which undercuts one of President Barack Obama’s signature efforts to fight climate change — would also propel the Trump administration toward a courtroom clash with California, which has vowed to stick with the stricter rules even if Washington rolls back federal standards. That fight could end up creating one set of rules for cars sold in California and the 12 states that follow its lead, and weaker rules for the rest of the states, in effect splitting the nation into two markets. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to frame the initiative as eliminating a regulatory burden on automakers that will result in more affordable trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles for buyers, according to people familiar with the plan. An E.P.A. spokeswoman confirmed that Mr. Pruitt had sent a draft of the 16-page plan to the White House for approval. The particulars of the plan are still being worked out. Those specifics, which are expected this year, could substantially roll back the Obama-era standards, according to two people familiar with the deliberations. “This is certainly a big deal,” said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard environmental economics program. “The result will be more gas-guzzling vehicles on the road, greater total gasoline consumption, and a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions.” According to two people familiar with the E.P.A.’s plans, Mr. Pruitt was scheduled to formally announce his proposal on Tuesday at an auto dealership in the Virginia suburbs, but the schedule remained in flux. Major automakers would welcome the change. They are prepared to participate in making new rules that meet “our customers’ needs for affordable, safe, clean and fuel-efficient transportation,” said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents many of the world’s largest automakers. In California, state lawyers said they were expecting a fight. The state has a special waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act empowering it to enforce stronger air pollution standards than those set by the federal government, a holdover from California’s history of setting its own air pollution regulations before the federal rules came into force. “We’re prepared to do everything we need to defend the process,” said Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, in an interview. The California waiver gives the state considerable power to require automakers to stick to stricter standards. Not only is California a huge car market itself, but 12 other states including New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have historically followed its lead. Together they represent more than a third of the domestic auto market. “We’re going to defend first and foremost existing federal greenhouse gas standards,” Mr. Becerra said. “We’re defending them because they’re good for the entire nation. No one should think it’s easy to undo something that’s been not just good for the country, but good for the planet.” Mr. Pruitt has signaled that he is ready to take on such a challenge. “California is not the arbiter of these issues,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV this month. Under the Obama administration, the federal government toughened tailpipe pollution standards to match California’s. Mr. Pruitt said the state standards “shouldn’t and can’t dictate to the rest of the country what these levels are going to be.” The E.P.A.’s senior clean air adviser, William Wehrum, this week traveled to California and met with the state’s top clean air official, Mary Nichols. Both sides declined to detail what was discussed. On Wednesday, a coalition of free-market groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute urged Mr. Pruitt to take California on. “It is time for the E.P.A. to act,” the groups said. If the agency did not act quickly, the groups said, “people across the state of California will be facing unrealistic and costly mandates which threaten their basic right to choose.” President Trump has also spoken about rolling back the efficiency rules, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or Cafe. “I’m sure you've all heard the big news that we’re going to work on the Cafe standards so you can make cars in America again,” Mr. Trump said at a Detroit auto research facility in March last year. “We want to be the car capital of the world again. We will be, and it won’t be long.” The rules, aimed at cutting tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming, were one of the two pillars of Mr. Obama’s climate change legacy. Put forth in 2012, they would have required automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. If fully implemented, the rules would have cut oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels and reduced carbon dioxide pollution by about six billion tons over the lifetime of all the cars affected by the regulations, according to E.P.A. projections. The rules also would have put the United States, historically a laggard in fuel economy regulations, at the forefront worldwide in the manufacture of electric and highly fuel efficient vehicles. The United States and Canada are the only major nations that have adopted mandatory emissions standards through 2025. The European Union has only recently proposed standards for 2025 and 2030, while China has only started to work on standards for those years. Less restrictive regulations in the United States could provide an opening for automakers to push for more lenient standards elsewhere as well, leading to the emission of more pollution by cars around the world. While sales of electric vehicles are starting to take off, they still represent barely 1 percent of global car sales. A shift among car buyers toward larger cars and trucks is already impeding progress in fuel economy. “The concern is that automakers will go around the world basically trying to lobby regulators, saying, look, because the United States has reduced the pace, everywhere else should too,” said Anup Bandivadekar, a researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a think tank that focuses on clean car technology and policy. Global carmakers “apply developments in one region to lobby for changes in other regions.” American automakers initially accepted the plan by Mr. Obama in 2009 to harmonize what was then a hodgepodge of pollution and efficiency standards set by the E.P.A., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and California. And the automakers weren’t in much of a position to resist; they had just taken an $80 billion bailout to survive a global economic crisis. The plan would have spurred automakers to speed their development of highly fuel-efficient vehicles including hybrid and electric cars. But within weeks of Mr. Trump’s inauguration last year, the chief executives of the nation’s Big Three auto companies met with him in the Oval Office to say that the Obama tailpipe standard was too difficult to achieve. Mr. Trump directed the E.P.A. under Mr. Pruitt to craft a new, less strict set of standards. The announcement expected on Tuesday would represent the first legal step in the process. While Mr. Pruitt’s proposal to open up the Obama rules to review isn’t expected to include specific targets, “The proposed rollback is going to be quite a significant number,” said Myron Ebell, who led Mr. Trump’s E.P.A. transition team and directs the energy and environment policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization that questions the established science of human-caused climate change. “It will be more than a couple m.p.g.,” he said. If the legal fight between California and the Trump administration escalates, one possibility is that the federal government might try to revoke the waiver allowing California to set its own rules. Some presidents, including George W. Bush, have considered revoking the waiver, but none have tried. The announcement by Mr. Pruitt was not expected to include a decision on challenging the waiver. Mr. Ebell suggested that one possible legal tactic for the Trump administration could be to announce that it will refuse to renew the current waiver on tailpipe emissions, which expires in 2025, rather than to revoke it outright. That would likely delay a court fight until California moves to set standards that go beyond 2025. But such a move would also likely formalize, at least for the time being, two different sets of rules in the United States — the federal emissions rules, and California’s stricter ones — a logistical headache for the industry. While California and its ally states have long followed separate smog standards, those have been easier for automakers to meet because a car can be brought into compliance by adding a catalytic converter, for example. Designing for separate mileage standards is more difficult, because fuel economy is dependent on a car’s weight and design. A divided market could require substantially different car designs, experts say, putting the American auto industry into uncharted territory. It remains unclear how the issue might be resolved. One possibility is that two very different auto markets emerge, one with cleaner cars generally along the coasts, and another with more polluting cars concentrated in Middle America. On the other hand, automakers might also opt to generally adhere to the stricter California standards nationwide, blunting the impact of any Trump administration rollback of federal rules. The automakers had hoped to avoid these complex scenarios by using their clout with the Trump administration to force California to go along with a relaxation of federal regulations. But “if they thought this would end by California rolling over and giving up its more stringent standards,” said Kevin Poloncarz, a San Francisco lawyer who focuses on air and climate change law, “that was a miscalculation.” As a result, the automakers’ victory might come with unexpected headaches for them, said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former counsel to the Obama administration. For instance, if the rest of the world moves toward stricter rules anyway, the American market could find itself an industry laggard, ceding leadership in clean vehicle technology to markets like China or the European Union. “I don’t really know if the auto industry wants what this administration might be doing,” she said. “It might be like the dog that caught the car.”",The New York Times
2018,E.U. Joins U.K. in Denouncing Russia Over Poisoning of Spy,"BRUSSELS — Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, won greater than expected support from the European Union on Friday over her escalating diplomatic battle with Russia, a significant victory for a leader who has often found herself isolated in Brussels as her country prepares to quit the bloc. After hours of discussion, European leaders issued a relatively tough statement effectively blaming Moscow for the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, on British soil. The European Union announced the withdrawal of its ambassador to Moscow for consultations, while President Emmanuel Macron said that France and other countries, including Germany, would also take measures, prompting speculation that they would expel some Russian diplomats, as Britain did in response to the attack. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Denmark are among nations expected to take action as soon as Monday. “We consider this attack as a serious challenge to our security and European sovereignty, so it calls for a coordinated and determined response from the European Union and its member states,” Mr. Macron said at a joint news conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. In a declaration of “unqualified solidarity” with Britain, issued early Friday, the European Union said it agrees with the British assessment that “it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible and that there is no plausible alternative explanation.” The statement followed long talks in which Mrs. May described the reasoning behind Britain’s conclusions that the Kremlin was behind the attack in the quiet cathedral city of Salisbury, including its identification of the chemical used — a strain of the nerve agent Novichok — and its belief that Russia has produced this substance in the last decade. Welcoming the E.U. response, Mrs. May said it was right that European nations were “standing together” because the hostile challenge Russia poses “respects no borders, and it is a threat to our values.” In response, Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, said that he “did not know what the heads of the E.U. states agreed with” when they offered their support to Britain, as Russia was not given any information. “We don’t agree with this and repeat that Russia had absolutely nothing to do with the Skripal case,” he said. Sergei Zheleznyak, a lawmaker from the United Russia party, said that the European Union, under pressure from London and Washington, “was forced to concoct a statement that is vague in content and politicized in essence.” The declaration was a somewhat surprising success for Mrs. May, who has often found herself at odds with her European counterparts as she negotiates Britain’s exit from the bloc, a process known as Brexit. The text was tougher than one agreed to earlier this week by European Union foreign ministers after talks attended by Britain’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The issue of relations with Russia divides European Union nations sharply, and there has been pressure from some to lift economic sanctions against Moscow, so Britain has not pressed for additional steps of that kind. However the Irish Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar, said there was talk of the existing measures being renewed for a 12-month period; currently they have to be rolled over every six months. In any event, the Skripal case has reduced prospects of them being relaxed anytime soon. Before the summit meeting, Mr. Putin spoke by phone with three European Union leaders, the Kremlin announced, a reminder that Moscow has allies within the bloc. Several countries, including Cyprus and Greece, have close ties to the Kremlin and have been reluctant to take a tougher line. But in traditional European Union style, they agreed to the latest text after extracting concessions on other issues — in this case, wording critical of Turkey’s actions in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean, the site of tensions over drilling for gas. Though the European Union’s show of support for Britain is so far largely symbolic, it suggests that even after Brexit, London could retain close ties to the bloc on foreign policy, security and defense. It also underscored the strength of Anglo-French cooperation on such issues, with France taking the lead in pushing for a tough, Europe-wide, response. Mr. Macron said that in the poisoning case the French had been asked for “technical cooperation” by the British, and had reached similar conclusions about Russian culpability. Yet, this time Mrs. May was arguing as the leader of a big member nation from inside a European summit. After next March, Britain’s prime minister will no longer attend such meetings, making the prospect of such a unified European response to a British concern less likely. On the broader Brexit agenda, things will undoubtedly get difficult again soon. European Union leaders agreed on Friday to the terms of a 21-month transition deal to prevent a “cliff edge” change in trading rules when Britain officially leaves the bloc next March. The leaders also paved the way for far-reaching talks on a future trade partnership, though there is still no agreement on how to avoid border checkpoints on the frontier between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union. On trade discussions, Mr. Macron took an uncompromising stance over Britain’s intention to quit the European Union’s single market, which lays down common rules and standards for goods and many services. “If you are out of the single market you are totally out of it,” he said, adding that, to preserve its integrity, “Europe will stand united.”",The New York Times
2018,E.U. Leader Threatens to Retaliate With Tariffs on Bourbon and Bluejeans,"BERLIN — The European Union will hit back at the heart of the United States, slapping tariffs on products like Harley-Davidsons, Kentucky bourbon and bluejeans, if President Trump goes ahead with a plan to place tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, the president of the bloc’s executive arm vowed on Friday. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, made the remarks to the German news media in reaction to the proposed tariffs. He said the plans to tax the American goods, produced in the home states of key Republican leaders, had not yet been finalized, but amounted to treating them “the same way” that European products would be handled if the metals tariffs go through. “None of this is reasonable, but reason is a sentiment that is very unevenly distributed in this world,” Mr. Juncker declared. He said any measures taken by the bloc would conform with rules set by the World Trade Organization. READ MORE: • The president on Friday appeared eager to defend his decision to levy sweeping tariffs, calling trade wars “easy to win.” • But other countries said they would respond to steel and aluminum tariffs with restrictions of their own. • A global tit-for-tat on trade could crimp economic growth. Here’s how. Mr. Juncker’s was not the only denunciation to flow in after Mr. Trump told industry executives on Thursday that he planned to impose penalties of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports from all countries. Criticism came from governments, lawmakers, metals makers and labor unions around the world. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Friday that the government “rejects” the tariffs, adding that such measures could lead to a global trade war, which “can’t be in anyone’s interest.” Hans Jürgen Kerkhoff, president of the German Steel Federation, said on Friday: “These measures clearly violate the rules of the World Trade Organization. If the E.U. does not react, our steel industry will pay the bill for U.S. protectionism.” He called on the bloc to take action, through the W.T.O. Simon Clarke, a Conservative member of Britain’s Parliament and vice chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Steel and Metal Related Industries, wrote on Twitter on Friday: “Tariffs are the worst possible option for the world economy and a major threat to U.K. steel in particular.” Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community Union, a British labor union, also denounced the move on Twitter: “Donald Trump is putting jobs at risk on both sides of the Atlantic. Thousands of steelworkers across the country voted for Brexit on the promise it would deliver a new era of international trade.” He called on Prime Minister Theresa May to ensure that steel products exported by Britain were exempt from the proposed tariffs. The global reactions hinted at a looming trade war if Mr. Trump followed through on campaign promises of an “America First” trade policy. On Friday, the president doubled down on his promise in a Twitter post: “When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win.” He added later, “If you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country!” Pressed for reaction to Mr. Trump’s first tweet, which was sent in the course of a regular weekly government news conference, Mr. Seibert declined to comment, except to say, “The German government has not changed its position in the past 18 minutes.” The White House has said that the tariff details remain to be worked out, and Mr. Seibert said the German government was awaiting the exact details before assessing the scope of the impact. But Germany made clear that Berlin viewed such measures as damaging to the country’s steel industry. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he viewed the proposal with “great concern” and defended his country’s practices in the industry. The United States is the most important export country for German rolled steel products and the second-most important destination for the European Union, after Turkey, according to official government statistics. Mr. Gabriel said, “Such a sweeping blow from the U.S. would reverberate around the world, but our exports and jobs would be among the hardest in the world hit.” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries, warned that Mr. Trump was risking a “spiral of protectionism” that in the end would cost American jobs, as well as those in Germany and the rest of Europe. But Mr. Kempf urged everyone to “keep a cool head” in an effort to avoid feeding the flames of a global trade war. Mr. Juncker’s proposal to hit back at the United States through some of the products for which it is best known in Europe was first floated last month in the German news media. The German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung cited a plan to target the home states of influential members of the Republican Party, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. “We are here and they will get to know us,” Mr. Juncker said. Asked if he believed a trade war was brewing, he responded, “I can’t see how this isn’t part of warlike behavior.” Bruno Le Maire, the French economy minister, speaking to reporters in Paris, said the tariffs would have a “major impact” on the European economy and on a number of French companies. He said that the steel and aluminum industries were in a “particularly fragile” situation and that certain countries practiced “dumping” and “massive subsidies” that distorted trade. “American authorities know this perfectly well,” he said. “That is the topic that needs to be addressed, and not another.” He added, “A trade war between Europe and the United States will only result in losers.” Officials around the world have been voicing varying degrees of dismay and anger since the proposal was unveiled on Thursday. Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said: “Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.” The United States has much to lose in a metals trade war with Canada, a crucial strategic ally and major trading partner, Ms. Freeland said. She noted that the United States has a steel trade surplus with its northern neighbor, which is both the largest buyer of American steel and the largest seller of steel to the United States. On Friday, the criticism continued, with Australia’s trade minister, Steven Ciobo, saying that Mr. Trump’s action would provoke retaliatory measures that would hurt everyone. “The imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and, ultimately, we believe, will lead to a loss of jobs,” he said. At a daily briefing on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said: “China urges the United States to exercise restraint in using trade protectionism tools.” But Li Xinchuang, vice chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association, was more blunt. In a phone interview on Friday, he said: “I feel Trump’s decision is stupid. It will only make the U.S. steel industry, which is already 10 years behind China, more left behind.” He added, “Trump’s decision does no good to everyone except a few American steel enterprises. Trump is a businessman, and he should understand win-win. But he took such extreme action.” The countries hit hardest by the proposed tariffs would be Canada, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea, which together account for almost half of United States steel imports. The United States is also a substantial market for Britain’s steel industry. In an emailed statement on Friday, UK Steel, an industry group, said that almost 15 percent of Britain’s steel exports or 360 million pounds ($496 million) a year went to the United States. Richard Warren, the group’s head of policy, said in an email of the proposed tariffs: “This would be a unilateral and extremely blunt approach to what is a complex global problem of overcapacity in the steel sector.” Arcelor Mittal, the world’s biggest steel maker and the largest steel producer in Europe and the United States, said it was assessing the possible impact of Mr. Trump’s proposal. But in a sign of the potentially adverse effects that Mr. Trump’s plan may have on the American economy, Electrolux, a global maker of household appliances, said on Friday that it would delay a planned $250 million investment to expand and modernize a factory in Tennessee. “We’re concerned about the impact that the tariffs could have on the competitiveness of our U.S. operations,” the company said in a statement, adding it would seek more details of Mr. Trump’s plan before deciding whether to move forward. In what was considered a rare comment on a member’s trade stance, Roberto Azevêdo, the World Trade Organization’s director general, said in a statement: “The W.T.O. is clearly concerned at the announcement of U.S. plans for tariffs on steel and aluminum. The potential for escalation is real, as we have seen from the initial responses of others.” He added: “A trade war is in no one’s interests. The W.T.O. will be watching the situation very closely.”",The New York Times
2018,E.U. Pledges to Fight Back on Trump Tariffs as Trade War Looms,"BRUSSELS — European Union officials unveiled an array of tariffs on Wednesday that they would place on American-made goods if the United States followed through on President Trump’s plan to impose penalties on imported steel and aluminum, raising the specter of a trade war. The announcement in Brussels was the latest rebuke to Mr. Trump’s proposed tariffs, which have met with consternation domestically and with threats of retaliation abroad. The president’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, said on Tuesday that he was resigning, a move widely believed to be linked to the trade plan, which he had lobbied against. Republican leaders, including Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, have also railed against the tariffs. Internationally, the plan for the new American tariffs — blanket penalties of 25 percent on imported steel and of 10 percent on aluminum — have drawn concern from allies including Britain and Canada, as well as from rivals like China. The European Union had warned of retaliatory charges last week, and outlined those plans on Wednesday. Such a move by the United States would “put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy, and it has to be met by a firm and proportionate response,” Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union commissioner for trade, said at a news conference in Brussels. European officials have been meeting with their counterparts in Washington, urging them to revisit the plans, she added. If the American tariffs are put in place, Ms. Malmstrom said, Brussels could take three steps: It could take the case to the World Trade Organization, add safeguards to protect the European Union against steel diverted from the United States, and impose tariffs on a series of American-made goods. A provisional list of items being targeted ranges from steel to T-shirts, also including bed linen, chewing tobacco, cranberries and orange juice, among other products. The overall size of the business affected is relatively small, worth about 2.8 billion euros, or $3.5 billion, in imports, paling in comparison with the nearly €250 billion of goods the 28-nation bloc bought from the United States in 2016. European leaders were quick to stress that they did not want to trigger a wider trade dispute, with Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, saying in a tweet that trade wars were “bad and easy to lose,” a reference to an earlier tweet by Mr. Trump in which he claimed they were “good and easy to win.” Officials elsewhere have also tried to cool tensions. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, warned in an interview on French radio that in a trade war, “nobody wins, one generally finds losers on both sides.” But it reflects concern in Europe over the possible impact of new American tariffs, notably on steel. The United States is the world’s largest importer of steel, and while many of Mr. Trump’s arguments have focused on cheap steel from countries like China, the European Union as a whole is the single biggest exporter of steel to the United States. At the same time, the region is concerned that cheap steel that had been destined for the United States could now flood the Continent, putting significant pressure on European producers. President Trump’s push for tariffs is driven by his fixation on trade deficits. But most economists do not worry about trade deficits, and disagree with the president’s characterization of them. Read more here » While retaliation from Brussels appears limited for now, it could have an impact on American domestic politics. Bourbon, one of the products that European officials have targeted, is made in Kentucky, the home state of Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Other items that could face tariffs are motorcycles, and the corporate headquarters of Harley-Davidson are in Wisconsin, Mr. Ryan’s state. “The Europeans have rights, too, to retaliate,” said Peter Chase, a former American diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels focusing on trade. “The E.U. is concerned that behind it all, there are people in the U.S. administration that don’t care that there might be damage to the international system of rule of law that we have created.” The list, which was leaked on Monday and has been referred to by the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is subject to the agreement of the bloc’s 28 member states. It highlights how sharply the outlook on trade between the United States and Europe has shifted. Since 2013, Washington and Brussels have been negotiating a vast trade deal, known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. By late 2016, however, those talks appeared to have reached a stalemate, and Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from a similar pact with Pacific Rim countries early in his presidency signaled the death of the European agreement, as well. The steel and aluminum tariffs have triggered a strong reaction, with business executives and political leaders voicing opposition. Read more here » The strong negative reaction to Mr. Trump’s planned tariffs appears to have had little impact on the president, who insisted this week that he would not back down. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump singled out the European Union, which he said had “not treated us very well, and it’s been a very, very unfair trade situation.” The president warned that the United States would also consider raising its tariffs on cars made within the bloc if the European Union were to retaliate. While he left the door open for compromise with allies, tensions are rising in Europe. “We’ve loaded the guns,” said Charles de Lusignan, a spokesman for the European Steel Association, a lobbying group, “and we’re ready to use them in case the aggression comes.” OpinionRuchir Sharma",The New York Times
2018,EMP Summer House Returns to the Hamptons,"Off the Menu EMP SUMMER HOUSE The popular summer outpost in East Hampton, N.Y., that Will Guidara and the chef Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park ran last year returns, starting May 25 and running Wednesdays to Sundays through mid-September. It will again feature casual indoor and outdoor dining on the lawn and covered patio, with a somewhat more formal menu in the dining room inside. Lobster tempura, tomato salad and rib-eye for two are likely to be served. Large-format dinners for groups of six to eight will again be available. Unlike last season’s pop-up, which was a way to keep staff employed while Eleven Madison Park underwent renovations, this one will hire mainly from the community. The success of the experiment led Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara’s Make It Nice group to plan a similar winter branch, to open in December, in Aspen, Colo. Both will be run in partnership with American Express, the only credit card accepted at the pop-ups. Starting May 1, reservations for the indoor dining room can be made online through June 30; as of June 1, they can be made through July 31, and starting July 1, they will be taken through September: 341 Pantigo Road, East Hampton, N.Y., empsummerhouse.com. SAM WON GARDEN This Koreatown restaurant in Manhattan is the introductory American branch of what is said to have been the first Korean tabletop barbecue restaurant, opened in Seoul in 1976. The New York version will be on three floors and seat 180 people, tiny when compared to the 1,200-seat original. Run by Simon Lee, the owner of the Franco-Korean bakeries Paris Baguette, it will feature beef from a ranch in Arizona that is dry-aged at the restaurant. Other dishes will include beef tartare bibimbap, spicy intestine casserole, bacon-mung bean pancakes, and, special to New York, kimchi poutine. The wine list concentrates on New World selections. (Monday): 37 West 32nd Street, 212-695-3131. PLANTMADE A new addition to the chef Matthew Kenney’s global collection of vegan restaurants (they say plant-based) has opened in New York. It’s the fourth in the city for him and his partners. The 50-seat all-day cafe serves potato niçoise bagels with almond pâté and olives, truffled “cheese” panini and coconut cream pie, among other items. It pours Haitian Bleu coffee, an heirloom variety that appears in drinks like pine pollen cappuccino. Proceeds from coffee sales go toward restoring land in Haiti that was devastated by recent natural disasters: 152 Second Avenue (Ninth Street), matthewkenneycuisine.com/plantmade.

ANDREW CARMELLINI and his partners Luke Ostrom and Josh Pickard of the NoHo Hospitality Group, which runs Locanda Verde, Lafayette and Leuca, are adding Pier 17 at South Street to their portfolio. They plan to create an Italian chophouse, as yet unnamed, centered on fire-grilled beef, seafood and poultry, in a two-story, 11,000-square-foot space in the Howard Hughes Corporation’s Seaport District development, which also includes a restaurant and market by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and a restaurant from David Chang. Mr. Carmellini’s project, in the southwest corner of the Pier, is to open next year. BRIAN LOIACONO, a former chef for Daniel Boulud at Bar Boulud and DB Bistro Moderne, will take over the kitchen at John McDonald’s restaurant, Sessanta, in the Sixty SoHo, to be renamed Bistrot Leo. His menu, in place starting in April, will represent a shift to French bistro fare from the original Italian approach. Previously, Mr. McDonald had hoped to keep it Italian, with Adam Leonti in the kitchen, but there were complications preventing Mr. Leonti from coming on board. Mr. McDonald now says he feels there are plenty of Italian options in Lower Manhattan but fewer French ones. CAROLINE FIDANZA, who closed her much-loved sandwich shop, Saltie, last year, has been named to be the culinary director of Andrew Tarlow’s Brooklyn restaurant group.

2018,Earliest Known Human Footprints in North America Found on Canadian Island,"Trilobites Big feet. Little feet. A heel here. A toe there. Stamped across the shoreline of Calvert Island, British Columbia, are 13,000-year-old human footprints that archaeologists believe to be the earliest found so far in North America. The finding, which was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, adds support to the idea that some ancient humans from Asia ventured into North America by hugging the Pacific coastline, rather than by traveling through the interior. “This provides evidence that people were inhabiting the region at the end of the last ice age,” said Duncan McLaren, an anthropologist at the Hakai Institute and University of Victoria in British Columbia and lead author of the study. “It is possible that the coast was one of the means by which people entered the Americas at that time.” Dr. McLaren and his colleagues stumbled upon the footprints while digging for sediments beneath Calvert Island’s beach sands. Today, the area is covered with thick bogs and dense forests that the team, which included representatives from the Heiltsuk First Nation and Wuikinuxv First Nation, could only access by boat. At the close of the last ice age, from 11,000 to 14,000 years ago, the sea level was six to ten feet lower. The footprints were most likely left in an area that was just above the high tide line. “As this island would only have been accessible by watercraft 13,000 years ago,” Dr. McLaren said, “it implies that the people who left the footprints were seafarers who used boats to get around, gather and hunt for food and live and explore the islands.” They found their first footprint in 2014. While digging about two feet beneath the surface in a 20-square-inch hole, they saw an impression of something foot-shaped in the light brown clay. In 2015 and 2016, they returned and expanded the muddy pit. They discovered several more steps preserved in the sediment. The prints were of different sizes and pointed in different directions. Most were right feet. When the team was finished they had counted 29 in total, possibly belonging to two adults and a child. Each was barefoot. The researchers think that after the people left their footprints on the clay, their impressions were filled in by sand, thick gravel and then another layer of clay, which may have preserved them. Using radiocarbon dating on sediment from the base of some footprint impressions, as well as two pieces of preserved wood found in the first footprint, Dr. McLaren and his team found them to be 13,000 years old. That would make them the oldest preserved human footprints in North America. “It’s not only the footprints themselves that are spectacular and so rare in archaeological context, but also the age of the site,” said Michael Petraglia, an archaeologist from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany who edited the paper for PLOS One but was not involved in the work. “It suggests an early entrance into the Americas.” Dr. Petraglia said the footprints also provided strong evidence for the coastal movement hypothesis and he added that they may have traveled the so-called “Kelp Highway,” a hypothesis that underwater kelp forests supported ecosystems down the North Pacific coast that helped ancient seafaring people hunt, develop and migrate. “The work is important because it shows the ‘real’ people, not just artifacts or skeletal remains,” said Steve Webb, a biological archaeologist at Bond University in Australia. “However, the footprints are limited in number and don’t shed light on activities or movement that tell us very much.” He added that future hunts for footprints should keep in mind that not everyone from this time period walked around barefoot. If anthropologists are too busy searching for soles, toes and arches, they might miss clues from those who wore animal skin shoes.",The New York Times
2018,East River Helicopter Crash Kills 5 in New York; Pilot Survives,"Five people were killed after a helicopter crashed into the East River off Manhattan on Sunday night, leaving only the pilot alive, the authorities said. The red helicopter was flying along a popular route for sightseers who want to view the Manhattan skyline. But witnesses said it was flying too fast and descending too quickly. From high-rise apartment buildings and parks along the river, they watched as the helicopter, losing altitude as if it were landing on solid ground, plunged into the chilly water. Its swirling rotors chopped into the river, eventually coming to a stop as it tilted, capsized and began to sink shortly after 7 p.m. Moments later, the pilot escaped, climbed to the top of the wreckage and yelled for help, a witness said. A flotilla of tugboats and emergency boats converged on the crash site, a couple of hundred yards north of Roosevelt Island, and began a frenzied search for others on board. Emergency responders dived into the water to rescue the passengers, who were tightly harnessed in and had to be cut out, Daniel A. Nigro, the commissioner of the New York Fire Department, said at a news conference. Battling currents of 5 miles per hour and a water temperature below 40 degrees, he said, the responders pulled the passengers out of the submerged helicopter and brought them ashore. Despite the rescue efforts, all five passengers were killed, James Long, a Fire Department spokesman, said early Monday morning. Two were declared dead at the scene and three died in local hospitals. Commissioner Nigro said the pilot was at a hospital and in “O.K.” condition. “It was a great tragedy that we had here,” he said. It was not immediately clear what caused the helicopter to crash. Witnesses said it caught their attention because it was traveling faster and at a lower altitude than the helicopters that normally fly along the East River between Manhattan and Queens. The National Transportation Safety Board said Monday that 14 of its employees were en route to investigate the crash. The helicopter, a Eurocopter AS350 owned by Liberty Helicopters, was flying as a private charter to take photos, Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill said at the news conference. A brochure for Liberty Helicopters, which is based in New Jersey, says it is the only company licensed to fly within 1,000 feet of the Statue of Liberty on all of its tours. Its pilots have been “flying safely” for 28 years, according to the brochure. The company could not be reached for comment on Sunday night. People who witnessed the crash said they saw emergency responders pull one person out of the water — a man who was wrapped in a white blanket — and place him in an ambulance at about 8 p.m. About an hour later, three people were taken out of the water and placed on stretchers. Emergency responders were seen performing CPR on them as they were placed into ambulances. Kaderia Melchon was walking in Carl Schurz Park on the Upper East Side of Manhattan when she said she spotted the helicopter descend into the water. Because it was red, she said she first thought it was a Fire Department helicopter. After it crashed, it flipped over almost immediately, its landing skids pointing into the air, she said. A man emerged and shouted for help, she said. Another witness, Xinran Jiang, who lives on Roosevelt Island with her husband, said that helicopters zoom over the East River all the time but that this one immediately caught their attention. “It almost looked like it was landing,” Ms. Jiang, who watched the crash from her bedroom window, said. “It wasn’t moving fast. We were curious where it was going to land. Then the next minute, it was diving into the river.” By 9:30 p.m., a tugboat had taken the helicopter to the East 34th Street Heliport. Helicopters are a common sight over New York City’s waterways, ferrying tourists on sightseeing trips and carrying commuters. Crashes are rare but not unheard-of. In 2011, three tourists died after a helicopter crashed into the East River; two other people survived. In 2004, a WNBC helicopter crashed onto a roof in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn while covering a shooting, but all three people on board survived. There were also no casualties when, in 2005, two helicopters — one of them carrying executives from MBNA Corporation, a major credit card company — crashed into the East River within less than a week. In 2009, when a helicopter carrying five Italian tourists was struck by a single-engine airplane over the Hudson River, everyone on both aircraft died. In 1997, an executive at Colgate-Palmolive was killed when a helicopter crashed into the East River moments after takeoff. And from 1985 to 1990, three aircraft owned by the same company, Island Helicopter, went down in the East River. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who died in a 2011 helicopter crash into the East River. It was three, not one. (Two died from injuries in the following weeks.)",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Easter Is Calling Me Back to the Church,"Margaret Renkl NASHVILLE — I went to church on Easter Sunday last year, and never went back. It wasn’t a boycott, exactly. It was an inability, week after week, to face the other believers. Still, I’d fully intended to go to Mass on Christmas Eve, but at the very last minute a crisis erupted in my extended family — an all-hands-on-deck kind of crisis — so I changed into my jeans and hung my poinsettia-red blouse back in the closet. In this house, we have never been Christmas-and-Easter-only Christians. My husband and I grew up in the church and raised our children there. Even during the hardest years, when mobilizing three young sons and various configurations of elderly parents felt like running the Iditarod every Sunday morning — even then, we didn’t miss Mass. But the 2016 presidential election changed all that for me. I just couldn’t forgive my fellow Christians for electing a man who exploited his employees, boasted about his sexual assaults, encouraged violence against citizens who disagreed with him, mocked the disabled and welcomed the support of virulent white supremacists. This is what Jesus meant when he told his followers to love one another? At church, all I could think about were the millions of people likely to lose their health insurance thanks to Catholic bishops who opposed the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act. I was supposed to be thinking about the infinite love of a merciful God, but all I could hear were thousands of Christians shouting, “Build that wall!” By the time Easter had come and gone, I was gone too. In some ways, there was nothing surprising about this breach. I love my parish, but I have always had a vexed relationship with the church. Long before 2016, the fault line was there, rumbling with every papal pronouncement affirming the male-only priesthood or claiming to speak with moral authority on issues of human sexuality. What kind of faith community denies a sacrament to parishioners who don’t happen to have been born heterosexual? During college and graduate school, I tried to talk myself out of believing in God. The reasons not to believe were multifarious and convincing. The reasons to believe came down to only one: I couldn’t not believe. I seem to have been born with a constant ache for the sacred, a deep-rooted need to offer thanks, to ask for help, to sing out in fathomless praise to something. In time I found my way back to God, the most familiar and fundamental something I knew, even if by then my conception of the divine had enlarged beyond any church’s ability to define or contain it. A church isn’t a necessary thing to a believer for whom the whole world is holy. But when our first baby was on the way, my husband and I signed on. We could have chosen another branch of Christianity, one whose secular framework more closely matched our own understanding of a church’s role in the world. But to a soul imprinted from birth on Roman Catholicism’s stained glass and incense and 2,000 years of art and music, all the other churches just seemed a little slight somehow. Not quite finished. And if all human institutions are by definition imperfect, why not throw in your lot with the one that made you, the one where everyone you love belongs? The worldly church is always a work in progress, and there is still hope for its redemption. “Anyway,” my husband said, “if a priest doesn’t baptize this baby, you know my mother will just take him into the bathroom and baptize him herself.” In the past year, while my husband and his father were at church on Sunday mornings, I was in the woods, where God has always seemed more palpably present to me anyway. (And not just to me: “Some keep the Sabbath going to Church,” Emily Dickinson wrote back in the 19th century. “I keep it, staying at Home.”) For me, a church can’t summon half the awe and gratitude inspired by a full-throated forest in all its indifferent splendor. The year away from church hasn’t made me miss the place itself. I don’t miss the stained glass. I don’t miss the gleaming chalice or the glowing candles or the sweeping vestments. But I do miss being part of a congregation. I miss standing side by side with other people, our eyes gazing in the same direction, our voices murmuring the same prayers in a fallen world. I miss the wiggling babies grinning at me over their parents’ shoulders. I miss reaching for a stranger to offer the handshake of peace. I miss the singing. So I will be at Mass again on Easter morning, as I have been on almost every Easter morning of my life. I will wear white and remember the ones I loved who sat beside me in the pew and whose participation in the eternal has found another form, whatever it turns out to be. I will lift my voice in song and give thanks for my life. I will pray for my church and my country, especially the people my church and my country are failing. And then I will walk into the world and do my best to practice resurrection.",The New York Times
2018,"Easter Week Around the World (and Hell, if It Exists)","For Christians around the world, Easter is a revered religious holiday: a deep mediation on the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ. From South Africa to India to Israel to Indonesia, the faithful held solemn ceremonies and processions, re-enacted Christ’s suffering on the cross and prayed for loved ones. The Holy Week leading up to Easter Sunday — also called Pascha and Resurrection Sunday — took various forms. Ahead of Easter celebrations, a church in Colombia donated 250,000 wafers to Venezuela’s Catholic Church, which has struggled to buy its own because a shortage of flour, according to news reports. “It is important to attend to the needs that afflict the faith as a result of this time of border crisis,” according to a statement from the diocese, in the city of Cúcuta. “At this time of the week, the central mysteries of the Christian faith can be celebrated.” The BBC said the wafers were handed over on a bridge between the two countries. Good Friday celebrations in the parish of Saiqi, China, went on with a conspicuous absence: the worshipers’ bishop had been whisked away by the government a day earlier. Bishop Guo Xijin, 59, of the Mindong diocese in central-eastern China, has been at the center of a tug of war between the Holy See and the Chinese authorities over who can appoint bishops in China and how to unite the country’s Catholics. He was detained on Monday after refusing to celebrate the Easter Mass with a government-approved bishop. But he was allowed to return home on Wednesday. At a pre-dawn Mass on Thursday, the bishop urged congregants at the Saiqi church to be brave and keep the faith. “Full of comfort and hope, we are inspired to more bravely face struggles and offer our love to God,” he told them. Not long after, government agents took him away for what they described as a “vacation” — a euphemism in China for an enforced disappearance, according to The Associated Press. On Holy Thursday, Pope Francis washed the feet of prisoners at an all-male prison in Rome, Regina Coeli — including two Muslims, an Orthodox Christian and a Buddhist. “Everyone always has the opportunity to change life and one cannot judge,” Francis told the prisoners. It was the fourth time in his five-year papacy that Francis has celebrated Mass in an Italian jail. But it took place alongside an eye-popping controversy, after the Rome newspaper La Repubblica quoted the pope as saying “A hell does not exist.” Eugenio Scalfari, 93, one of the newspaper’s founders, said Francis had told him that bad souls are “not punished,” and that the souls of repentant sinners “obtain God’s forgiveness and take their place among the ranks of those who contemplate him, but those who do not repent and cannot be forgiven disappear,” according to one translation. The reported remarks were seized upon by the pope’s conservative critics, and the Vatican scrambled to tamp down the brewing controversy, issuing a statement that said the conversation had been private and that the article should not be “considered a faithful transcription of the Holy Father’s words.” Mr. Scalfari is known for not taking notes and for reconstructing lengthy conversations with prominent figures from memory. An outspoken atheist, he has been granted several interviews by Francis, many of them followed by Vatican objections. The Paixão do Cristo (Passion of Christ) is a theatrical production in Pernambuco, Brazil, that is based on the life of Christ and is considered to be the largest open-air theater in the world. The play runs for one week during Easter and is watched by about 6,000 to 10,000 people each night. At a traditional Easter church service at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor, England, Queen Elizabeth II gave out purses containing commemorative coins to mark Maundy Thursday, when almsgiving and washing of feet traditionally start the celebrations for Easter. In a televised message on Good Friday, Prince Charles spoke of the persecution of Christians around the world and said he had been “deeply moved” by those who had the courage to forgive their tormentors. In Durban, South Africa, priests and nuns silently marched through the streets with wooden crosses on their shoulders on Good Friday, and throngs placed flowers on a wooden cross. In Nairobi, Kenya, many Christians spent Good Friday fasting or in prayer, repentance and meditation on the agony and suffering of Christ. In Ethiopia, Easter is generally celebrated after 55 days of fasting, with followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church offering daily prayers at the church and tending not to eat until 3 p.m., except on Saturday and Sunday, when prayers are conducted early in the morning. Villages and towns in Spain celebrated Semana Santa, or Holy Week, in their own way. In Verges, a village in Catalonia near the Costa Brava, the faithful wore skull masks and skeleton outfits while carrying scythes, ashes and clocks to perform an ancient “dance of death” to the beat of drums. The tradition is said to symbolize the final judgment after death to decide if a soul goes to heaven, to purgatory to hell. Others took part in flamboyant parades or extravagant penitents’ processions, carrying crosses on their backs to commemorate Jesus’ suffering. Roman Catholic devotees wearing crowns of twigs, including a woman, were nailed to wooden crosses by Filipinos dressed as Roman centurions in a Good Friday re-enactment of Jesus Christ’s sufferings. The ritual in the village of San Pedro Cutud merged church traditions with folk practices in which penitents attempt to atone for sins, pray for the sick or a better life, or give thanks for what they believe were miracles. The spectacle was watched by thousands of spectators but frowned upon by church leaders in the Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation. Archbishop Socrates Villegas said in a statement: “Instead of spilling your blood on the streets, why not walk into a Red Cross office and donate blood? Choose to share life. Share your blood.” In Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation, an estimated 6,000 Catholic pilgrims visited Larantuka — in the far east of the archipelago — for ceremonies around Holy Week. The festival there is centered on the legend of three religious statues that reportedly washed up on the shores in the 1500s. Locals pray for deceased relatives, there are religious processions by boat and on the streets, and worshipers crawl from the entrance of a church toward an altar where they pay homage to a shrine of religious relics, among other ceremonies. In Ireland, the holiday this year marked the advent of a new law. For almost a century, selling alcohol in Ireland on Good Friday had been banned — a legacy of the country’s deeply rooted Christian traditions. But after the Parliament passed new legislation in January, pubs in Ireland lifted the ban on alcohol for Good Friday. The move is seen as a boon for tourists and for businesses. It could generate as much as 40 million euros ($49 million) in sales. “The Good Friday ban is from a different era,” Padraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland, told the BBC. “Like all other businesses who were never subject to a ban, publicans now have a choice to open.”",The New York Times

IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN YOU THINK What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America By David Cay Johnston 306 pp. Simon & Schuster. $28. It takes a brave writer, in 2018, to attempt a book about Donald Trump’s presidency. During his one year in the White House, Trump has so thoroughly warped the space-time continuum of our news cycle that it seems preposterous that any words about his presidency, slapped between covers, won’t have been overtaken by events by the time they appear in print. Yet there are routes to staying power. One comes from Michael Wolff, whose jaw-dropping (and thinly sourced) tales of White House dysfunction in “Fire and Fury” cost Steve Bannon, Trump’s onetime Svengali, both his media platform and his billionaire patron. Another successful approach is provided by David Frum, whose elegantly written jeremiad “Trumpocracy” will give future historians ample evidence that not all Republicans fell in line behind their party’s president. With “It’s Even Worse Than You Think,” David Cay Johnston has chosen a third, more difficult path. A former New York Times reporter who in 2001 won a Pulitzer Prize for his exposés on tax loopholes, Johnston practices a brand of journalism that’s an amalgam of advocacy and forensic accounting. “It is not enough just to cover politics and controversies,” he writes. “Often the most important news goes unannounced, lying right out in the open in the government documents most journalists are loath to uncover and read.” It’s Johnston’s contention that much of the media’s coverage of Trump — fixated as it is on the president’s tweets and feuds — misses the real damage he’s doing to the country. “The Trump administration deposited political termites throughout the structure of our government,” Johnston argues. “The endgame is not just a smaller government, which Republicans always say they want, but a weak government.” Johnston sets out to shine a bright light on these termites. He finds an obvious one in Scott Pruitt, Trump’s man at the Environmental Protection Agency, whose “one-sided approach to E.P.A.’s mandate,” Johnston writes, favors the concerns of the industries it regulates at the expense of the public’s health. Of course, Pruitt has already received considerable media attention. But Johnston uncovers some less well-known termites as well. His chapter on the goings-on at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a textbook example of the sort of green-eyeshade reportage on which he built his formidable reputation. First, Johnston explains how Trump’s decision to force out the chairman left the commission with only two members, short of the three required for a quorum, which meant it was unable to approve “$50 billion worth of energy projects” that would have benefited American workers and consumers. Next, Johnston reports that when Trump finally got around to filling out the agency, he didn’t pick anyone with a consumer-protection background, like the chairman he’d just sacked, instead nominating three new commissioners who all favored the utilities. “Congress created FERC … to protect families, small-business owners and industry from monopolists and pricing schemes that jack up prices while at the same time ensuring an abundant supply of electricity,” Johnston writes. Under Trump, that mission is being eaten away at. But Johnston struggles to find other instances in which Trump is achieving the goal of creating a weak government — or at least one any weaker than those of his predecessors. Johnston blasts Trump for appointing political supporters rather than career diplomats as ambassadors to strategically important countries — mentioning, for example, William Francis Hagerty IV, a Tennessee private equity investor who was a Trump campaign fund-raiser and is now ambassador to Japan. But is Hagerty, who once worked as a business consultant in Asia and speaks Japanese, any less qualified for the Tokyo post than Caroline Kennedy, who held it under Obama? Other times, Johnston seems out of his depth, particularly when he strays from domestic politics. He justifiably criticizes Trump for tilting American foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia in its dispute with its gulf neighbor Qatar. But then Johnston bungles the explanation for why Trump is doing this, suggesting it is because he shares the Saudis’ animus toward Al Jazeera, which broadcasts from Qatar, or because he’s angry that Qatar Airways once moved its New York offices out of Trump Tower. The most likely explanation, which Johnston fails to discuss, is that the Saudis convinced Trump that Qatar is too close to Iran. To be sure, some of the book’s shortcomings are a result of deadline pressures, like Johnston’s contention that Trump “has nothing to show in terms of tax legislation.” Most of the “Trump budget cuts” Johnston assails — like a proposed $6 billion reduction for the National Institutes of Health — were ultimately rejected in February’s budget deal. But more often than not, “It’s Even Worse Than You Think” reads like a retelling of the various politics and controversies — from Sean Spicer lying about the crowd size at the Inauguration to the president blaming hurricane victims in Puerto Rico for not helping themselves — that dominated the media’s coverage of Trump’s first year in office. The result is an unsatisfying rehash. Although Johnston has been writing about Trump for almost three decades, he doesn’t offer any new or keen insights into Trump’s psychology and character. Unlike the gifted polemicist Frum, Johnston is a clunky writer whose passion only serves to produce such groaners as: “Cutting avenues to success for poor, working-class and even middle-class young people is a Make America Worse policy.” While Wolff features juicy quotes from close Trump aides likening the president to a child or accusing his eldest son of treason, Johnston favors dry denunciations of Trump from government ethics scolds who’ve offered the same words to countless newspapers and public radio shows in the past year. Indeed, “It’s Even Worse Than You Think” winds up making the opposite point of the one Johnston intends: In the realm of policy, what the Trump administration is doing to America, so far at least, is not as horrible as you feared.",The New York Times
2018,Ecuador Cuts Off Julian Assange’s Internet Access. Again.,"Ecuador’s government said Wednesday that it had suspended internet access for Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who since 2012 has lived in Ecuador’s Embassy in London, out of concern that he was harming its relationships with Britain and other European nations. The decision set off a furious reaction from some Assange supporters. One of them, Kim Dotcom, an online renegade who founded a file-sharing site, urged supporters to gather outside the embassy in protest. The filmmaker Oliver Stone wrote on Twitter: “Free Julian Assange! Restore his internet connection!” Ecuador’s government granted Mr. Assange citizenship in January, the latest step in a longstanding diplomatic standoff. But it said it had suspended Mr. Assange’s online communications on Tuesday because he had imperiled “the good relations that the country maintains with the United Kingdom, with the rest of the states of the European Union, and other nations” through his social-media messages. The government did not provide specifics, but some speculated that the decision might have been related to the Western nations’ coordinated actions against Russia after the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. In a series of Twitter posts this week, Mr. Assange was critical of Western nations’ expulsions of Russian diplomats. The agendas of WikiLeaks and Russia have dovetailed at times, whether by coincidence or intent. In July 2016, WikiLeaks published nearly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails that had been hacked by the Russian government, embarrassing the party’s nominee, Hillary Clinton. In November, it emerged that Donald Trump Jr. had online conversations with WikiLeaks during his father’s campaign. Two Assange supporters — the English rock musician Brian Eno and the Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis — speculated that Ecuador was reacting to tweets in which Mr. Assange criticized the Spanish government’s detention of Catalan separatists and the recent arrest, in Germany, of the separatist leader Carles Puigdemont. They called efforts to isolate Mr. Assange “appalling.” Here are key points in his case since WikiLeaks burst onto the scene in 2010. This was not the first time Ecuador had cut off Mr. Assange: It did so in October 2016, saying it feared being sucked into efforts to interfere in the American election. Mr. Assange went to the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning about rape allegations. Sweden dropped that inquiry last May, saying that too much time had passed. But Mr. Assange still faces a British charge for skipping bail and, more pressingly, fears being arrested and deported to the United States. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fueled such fears last year when he said that arresting Mr. Assange was “a priority.” Mr. Assange, a 46-year-old native of Australia, has long been an irritant for the British authorities. A junior foreign minister, Alan Duncan, told members of Parliament this week, “It’s about time that this miserable little worm walked out of the embassy and gave himself up to British justice.” Now, the patience of his Ecuadorean hosts appears to be wearing thin as well. Ecuador’s foreign minister, María Fernanda Espinosa, said Wednesday that officials would meet in London next week with Mr. Assange’s lawyers to explore additional measures that Ecuador might take in connection what she called Mr. Assange’s “noncompliance” with his agreement not to meddle in foreign affairs. “We are evaluating the measures with our lawyers,” she said. “We will explore what are the alternatives that allow us the framework of international law and our own legislation and Ecuadorean Constitution.” She added, “The most important thing is that Ecuador maintains a dialogue with the United Kingdom to find a definitive and lasting solution to this situation that the current government has inherited.” Her remarks alluded to the distaste that Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, has expressed toward Mr. Assange. Although it was Mr. Moreno’s government that gave Mr. Assange citizenship, the president appeared to have done so reluctantly, and mainly out of respect for his predecessor and ally, Rafael Correa.",The New York Times
2018,"Ed Charles, Infield Sage of the Miracle Mets, Is Dead at 84","Ed Charles, the heart and soul of the Miracle Mets of 1969, died on Thursday at his home in East Elmhurst, Queens. He was 84. His daughter-in-law, Tomika Charles, confirmed the death, saying he had been ill for several years. Charles was a vital member of the Mets team that suddenly jelled during the 1969 season, winning the World Series in one of the most surprising surges in baseball history and endearing themselves forever to fans who had suffered through the team’s wretched play since its beginning, just seven years earlier. The Mets’ players relied on the smile and the wisdom of Charles, who was then 36. “Ed Charles was this guy, you wanted to sit on his knee and hear how he made it,” Ron Swoboda, the right fielder on the 1969 team, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. He added: “He had a physical and emotional grace that most of us didn’t seem to feel. He would say, ‘Don’t wrestle with what looks like complexity.’” Edwin Douglas Charles was born in Daytona Beach, Fla., on April 29, 1933, a time of racial segregation in Florida. But he took heart as a teenager when he spotted Jackie Robinson in town as a Montreal Royal farmhand during spring training in 1946. Robinson was expected to become the 20th century’s first black player in the major leagues. Charles dropped out of school in his teens but returned as a football and baseball star, attracting scholarship offers. He hoped to play in the Negro leagues, but in the emerging age of integration he got a tryout with the Boston Braves. George McQuinn, the manager of the Braves’ Quebec City farm team, took him north, to cold weather and the odd experience of rooming with a white family. Charles’s way to the majors was blocked by Eddie Mathews, the Braves’ future Hall of Fame third baseman, but he also saw lesser infielders called up. He made it to the majors after being traded to the Kansas City Athletics in 1962. At 34, Charles was traded to the Mets in 1967, when they were still staggering along at the bottom of the league. In a game weeks after joining the team, he went to his left and snagged a hard shot before it could go past him, impressing the rookie left-handed pitcher Jerry Koosman so much that Koosman walked toward third base. “He was sort of flabbergasted that I’d made the play,” Charles recalled in 2009. “He said, ‘You sort of glide to the ball. That’s it. You’re the Glider from now on.’” The nickname did indeed stick. In 1968, the Mets brought in Gil Hodges, the old Brooklyn favorite, as manager. Setting an example by accepting his role as a platoon player, playing mainly against left-handed pitchers, Charles hit .207 in 61 games in 1969. But he had several crucial hits as the Mets won their division, the first league championship series (instituted after the league expanded), and then beat the powerful Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in five games. As the final out settled into the glove of Cleon Jones in left field at Shea Stadium, Charles raced toward the mound and leapt in the air, a beatific smile on his face. Charles was known to write and recite poetry, and as part of the Mets’ celebration in Bryant Park in Manhattan, he read a prayer-poem he had written while stuck in the minors in 1961. Part of it went, “Grateful to You I’ll always be/ For exploiting my talents for the world to see.” But he never played in the majors again. The Mets released him after the ’69 season and offered him a job in promotions, but after a dispute over $5,000 for moving expenses he returned home to Kansas City. Eventually moving to New York, he worked in various jobs and patched things up with the Mets, scouting and coaching for them in the minor leagues. He passed a Civil Service test in 1985 and worked with troubled youth at a home in the Bronx. “You’d see a kid trying to hurt himself, banging his head against the wall because somebody embarrassed him,” Charles said. “You’d see a kid who wouldn’t want to admit he can’t write. The department teaches us to pick up the phone and call for help.” In his spare time, Charles settled into the role of beloved former Met, sometimes representing the club at baseball conventions and autograph shows, showing up for old-timers’ days and at the emerging fantasy camps, and even taking part in an academic conference at Hofstra University in 2012. Moving to Queens, he took care of an elderly cousin, Sarah Lou Parker, then inherited her apartment, where he died. Charles, who was divorced, is survived by his longtime companion, Lavonnie Brinkley; two sons, Edwin and Eric; a sister, Virginia Charles; and a brother, Charlie. Charles was always eager to talk about his brushes with Jackie Robinson, starting with the sighting in Daytona Beach in 1946. Charles also recounted a story of how he later spotted Robinson, who was by then on the Brooklyn Dodgers’ roster, on a train. The Dodgers were in Florida playing an exhibition, and Charles and several friends “peered through openings in the fence,” he recalled in “Carrying Jackie’s Torch: The Players Who Integrated Baseball — and America,” by Steve Jacobson (2007). After the game, the Dodgers prepared to leave from the railroad station. “So now we’re walking down the platform, looking in the windows trying to see where Jackie was seated,” Charles said. “Finally we come to the right coach, and there is Jackie, playing cards. We waved and, you know, he waved back to us.” “Then the train starts pulling out,” he went on, “and we start slowly walking with it, just waving to Jackie. The train picked up speed. We kept running and waving till the train got out of sight.” “Things like that, you know, I can recall so vividly,” he said, “because they were very special moments in my life and in the life of the country. It was like the Messiah had come.” An earlier version of this obituary erroneously attributed a distinction to Charles. He received no votes for the American League Rookie of the Year award in 1962; he did not finish second. The earlier version also misstated his relationship to Sarah Lou Parker, a relative whose apartment in Queens he inherited. She was a cousin, not an aunt. And because of an editing error, it misstated the given name of Charles’s brother, who survives him. It is Charlie, not Elder.",The New York Times
2018,Edinburgh International Festival Embraces Youth at 71,"The mature and esteemed Edinburgh International Festival, which celebrated its 70th anniversary last summer, will boldly embrace youth during the opening of the 2018 festival, which will run Aug. 3-27. “Five Telegrams,” the festival’s opening event, an outdoor presentation of digital art and music, is being created by the eclectic young composer Anna Meredith — a former composer-in-residence with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra — and the design and technology company 59 Productions (“War Horse”). Fergus Linehan, the festival’s director, said in a phone interview Wednesday that “Five Telegrams,” to be presented in Festival Square and including projections on Edinburgh Castle, will also feature a performance element involving 250 young people in the crowd. Mr. Linehan officially announced the program in Edinburgh on Wednesday evening. In a festival as large and complex as his, with years of planning sometimes required for operas or certain performers (like the soprano Christine Goerke, who will sing Brünnhilde in Wagner’s “Siegfried” this summer), trying to affix a theme to the event “makes it a bit too brittle for my liking,” Mr. Linehan said. Still, outside influences do make their way in. This year, for example, is the centennial of the end of the Great War. “The end of the first World War is very present in a lot of work in the U.K. at the moment,” Mr. Linehan said. “It was the beginning of universal suffrage and the end of the Empire.” So some works in the festival, like “Xenos,” a new solo piece by the choreographer Akram Khan about a shellshocked colonial soldier — an Indian man fighting on behalf of the British Empire — reflect on this. The anniversary is also represented in “Five Telegrams,” which is partly inspired by soldiers’ telegrams from 1918. The lineup of youth orchestras from Canada, Scotland and the United States, and other parts of the music program, nod to Scotland’s Year of Young People, an initiative of the Scottish government. “Light on the Shore,” a celebration of Scottish music that will run throughout most of the festival, will showcase more of Ms. Meredith’s music along with electronica, hip-hop, folk and rock by Django Django, Mogwai, King Creosote and others. The French company Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord will present a slate of productions including “The Beggar’s Opera,” directed by Robert Carsen; “The Prisoner,” an exploration of justice and imprisonment created by the director Peter Brook (who is 92) and his regular collaborator Marie-Hélène Estienne; and the British director Katie Mitchell’s “La Maladie de la Mort,” an adaptation of Marguerite Duras’s 1982 novella about an unconventional sexual relationship. “They kind of reflect what the Bouffes has done over the years, bringing casts from all over the world to present these fables of humanity,” Mr. Linehan said. The beloved Scottish playwright David Greig (“The Events,” “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”) will be represented by “Midsummer,” a romantic comedy he wrote with Gordon McIntyre, that wowed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (the festival that pops up alongside the International every summer) almost a decade ago. “Midsummer” is arriving in an expanded version, courtesy of the National Theater of Scotland. The Galway-based Druid Theater’s “Waiting for Godot,” Anna Deavere Smith’s “Notes From the Field” and the magical American performer Geoff Sobelle’s “Home” are also in the theater lineup. There’s more, too, but Mr. Linehan said he also hopes audiences will take advantage of all of Edinburgh in August (when there is also a book festival at the same time), “and stumble into something they never would have gone to before.”",The New York Times
2018,"Efforts to Secure Elections Moving Too Slowly, Senators Tell Homeland Security Chief","WASHINGTON — Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee pressured Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, on Wednesday to speed up key election security measures, even as she trumpeted the adoption of important improvements ahead of November’s midterm elections. Ms. Nielsen told the senators, who are investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, that the department made significant strides in recent months working with state and local election officials to improve communication about threats and share cybersecurity resources. Those efforts include comprehensive risk assessments and cyberscans meant to identify vulnerabilities in election systems. But under questioning, Ms. Nielsen signaled that one of those undertakings, to grant full security clearances to state election officials so they could receive classified information on cybersecurity threats in a timely way, had been slow going. Of the up to 150 state election officials designated to receive clearances, only about 20 have them, she said. In the meantime, Ms. Nielsen said, the department would share necessary threat information with relevant state officials regardless of their clearance. Republicans and Democrats on the committee made clear that they expected more. “When I listen to your testimony, I hear no sense of urgency to really get on top of this issue,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Wednesday’s session was the secretive committee’s first public hearing designed to scrutinize findings from its year-old investigation into Russia’s interference campaign. It followed the committee’s release on Tuesday of a set of recommendations for state and federal officials to shore up the ballot box. That effort appeared likely to get substantial resources on Wednesday, as congressional leaders completed a more than $1 trillion government funding bill that included hundreds of millions of dollars for election security. The bill, which is expected to pass later this week, includes $380 million for state grants to improve election infrastructure, as well as $307 million above what the Trump administration had requested for the F.B.I. that can be used to combat cyberattacks, election fraud and other crimes. Top federal officials have concluded that Russian hackers targeted election systems in 21 states and breached that of at least one, Illinois, during the last election cycle. No votes were changed, but the effort — alongside a concerted Russian disinformation and hacking campaign — exposed dangerous vulnerabilities in the voting systems and the government’s ability to respond. American intelligence officials have warned that Russia considered its campaign to sow social and political divisions in 2016 a success, and is already meddling in the midterm elections. A central tool of the campaign — fake social media accounts to spread propaganda and disinformation — continues to be used unabated, the officials said. Ms. Nielsen echoed those concerns on Wednesday, making clear that with voting already underway in primary elections around the country, the threat was not over. “We think the threat remains high. We think vigilance remains important. And we think there is a lot we need to do at all levels of government before the midterms,” Ms. Nielsen said. “Once these vulnerabilities have been made clear, it’s not just Russia we have to worry about.” There are other challenges, Ms. Nielsen said. She noted that two states were not cooperating with the department to ensure that their systems were safe. Ms. Nielsen appeared alongside Jeh Johnson, who was President Barack Obama’s homeland security secretary during the 2016 election. Mr. Johnson was asked several times why his department and other Obama administration officials had not done more to warn state election officials and the public about the threats in the run-up to the election. He repeatedly defended his decision-making, saying that some states had rebuffed federal outreach and that the department had been able to directly assist more than 30 others. Mr. Johnson also lamented that greater heed was not taken of an October 2016 statement he signed with the director of national intelligence alerting the public to the Russian intrusion into election systems. “Frankly, it did not get the attention that I thought it should have received,” he said, noting that the statement was issued the same day that the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape surfaced. Some senators went further. Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, warned bluntly that the threat was “not being treated with the urgency that it deserves” and that a patchwork of defenses would mean little without a comprehensive cyberdeterrence strategy. Of the Russians’ targeting of state systems in 2016, he said, “What it looks like is a test.” “This country has to wake up,” he said, later telling Ms. Nielsen, “I encourage you to go back with your hair on fire.” The recommendations released by the committee on Tuesday — the first such disclosure in its investigation — covered much of what experts and intelligence officials have been urging election authorities to do for months. The panel also pressed the Trump administration to make it clear that any attack on an American election would be viewed as a hostile act. Those recommendations come from a fuller classified report on election security that the committee has prepared. The fuller document has to be submitted to the intelligence agencies for declassification before it can be released publicly, a process that could take weeks or months. The committee’s chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said on Wednesday that it would release an overview of its findings in the interim. The committee is expected to prepare similar reports in the coming months on other areas of investigation, including the Russians’ use of social media and whether the Trump campaign aided the meddling campaign.",The New York Times
2018,"Egypt Is Using Banned U.S.-Made Cluster Munitions in Sinai, Rights Group Says","Egypt’s armed forces have used internationally outlawed cluster bombs, made in the United States, in operations aimed at crushing Islamic extremists in northern Sinai, Amnesty International said Wednesday. The use of such weapons, if confirmed, would not only contravene the treaty banning their use, signed by a majority of countries, but may also violate United States laws regarding recipients of American military aid, like Egypt. Amnesty International said an analysis of an official Feb. 21 video released by the Egyptian military, trumpeting the triumphs of its northern Sinai crackdown on militants, showed one of the weapons, which can kill and maim indiscriminately. Although the video described the weapons as improvised explosive devices planted by the militants, Amnesty said, the markings on one identified it as an American-made Mk-118 anti-tank anti-personnel submunition, “which could only have been dropped by the Egyptian Air Force.” Amnesty said the video showed the weapon to be “untampered with and in good condition despite its age,” with an identifying number clearly visible. “This suggests that the submunition has been deployed in recent operations,” Amnesty said in a news release. “This new video confirms our worst fears, that the Egyptian armed forces are using cluster bombs in North Sinai,” the group said. While there have been other suggestions that Egyptian forces are using cluster munitions in the Sinai campaign, the video was proof, said Raed Jarrar, Amnesty’s advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa. “This is like the smoking gun, because it’s very obvious that these munitions were dropped from a fighter jet,” he said in a telephone interview. Mr. Jarrar suggested that the video, released by the Egyptian military spokesman’s office, had inadvertently betrayed, to knowledgeable viewers, what they were really seeing. “The Egyptian government is so deep in its own lies and propaganda, they have lost track of their own lies,” Mr. Jarrar said. There was no immediate reaction from the Egyptian government to Amnesty’s assertion, which was released early Thursday Egyptian time. Officials at the Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A State Department official, responding on the condition of anonymity, did not address Amnesty’s assertion about the Feb. 21 video. But the official said in an emailed statement that “the Department continues to emphasize to our Egyptian government interlocutors the importance of a comprehensive approach to counterterrorism that protects and minimizes damage to civilian populations.” Cluster munitions encompass an array of rockets, bombs, missiles and artillery projectiles that scatter smaller weapons, called submunitions, over a wide area. They can hit civilians far from intended targets. Roughly 20 percent fail to properly detonate upon impact, leaving unexploded bomblets that can kill civilians even years later. Egypt, like many other Middle East countries, has not signed the treaty banning cluster munitions. While the United States has not signed the treaty either, it pledged in 2008 to restrict their use. Department of Defense documentation obtained by Human Rights Watch and cited in their cluster munition survey shows that Egypt possessed 1,300 Rockeye cluster bombs, containing 321,000 Mk-118 submunitions, as of 2007. Stephen Goose, director of Human Rights Watch’s arms division, said he had not yet been able to discuss with Amnesty its assessment of the video. But he said that any use of cluster bombs “by Egypt or any other fighting force is appalling” and should be condemned. “That is why they have been banned internationally,” he said. “Egypt should cease any use of cluster bombs immediately.” Sinai’s Islamic extremists, who are largely confined to the peninsula’s northern half, have killed hundreds of Egyptian security officers since the military ousted the country’s first democratically elected leader, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013. Despite several campaigns aimed at “eradicating” the insurgency, the Egyptian authorities have failed to regain full control over the area. The military’s latest operation, which began on Feb. 9, has left at least 82 militants dead and more than 1,800 imprisoned, according to state media. Security and humanitarian concerns loom over these military efforts both in Egypt and internationally, as human rights advocates and local tribal leaders accuse the military of using scorched-earth tactics that are killing civilians, and radicalizing youths as a result. The Egyptian government vehemently denies these allegations, but it has refused to lift the news media blackout it imposed on northern Sinai since the unrest began. Even American officials, legally obliged to ensure that American weapons given as military aid to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s government are not being used to violate human rights, have often been denied access. Tribal leaders in the northern and central parts of the peninsula and human rights advocates say the local population is suffering from shortages of food, electricity and medicine. The authorities also frequently cut off the internet and cell service, and they have shut down schools and universities. An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the position held by Middle East countries regarding the treaty banning cluster munitions. While many, like Egypt, have not signed the treaty, others including Lebanon and Iraq have signed. OpinionThe Editorial Board",The New York Times
2018,"Egypt’s Early Vote Tally: Sisi, 92%, Token Opponent, 3%","CAIRO — Early results from Egypt’s election showed President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi headed for a landslide victory with 92 percent of the vote, state media reported Thursday, an unsurprising margin in a race where he eliminated all serious opposition months ago. Mr. Sisi’s token opponent, Moussa Moustapha Moussa, received just 3 percent of the vote, less than the number of spoiled ballots, state media said. With his main rivals in jail or forced from the contest, Mr. Sisi relied on voter turnout to demonstrate his popularity. State media said that about 40 percent of voters cast ballots during the three days of voting that ended Wednesday, down from 47 percent in the 2014 election that formalized Mr. Sisi’s power. State television said the preliminary results were based on counts in 24 of 27 governorates. It did not say what proportion of the vote had been tallied. Official results are expected on Monday. Voters were subject to bribes, blandishments and threats in an effort to get them to the polls. Some said they had been promised bags of free groceries or payments of as little as $3 for casting their ballot. Others were lavished with promises of improved municipal services, or tempted with a chance to win a pilgrimage to Mecca. On Wednesday, the election authority repeated a threat to impose a $28 fine on voters who failed to cast their ballot. Voting was extended by an hour on Wednesday after a sandstorm lashed Cairo, keeping some people from polls, officials said. Coverage of those tactics in the international news media drew harsh criticism from the government and its supporters, who accused reporters of presenting a distorted picture of the election. “So the foreign media chose darkness,” wrote Hany Assal, a columnist with the state-run Ahram newspaper. “It reported and searched for the negative and worked hard to emphasize it.” The State Information Service warned foreign reporters of unspecified consequences for “unprofessional” coverage of the election. Mr. Sisi’s Western allies have been largely silent through the campaign, offering little or no criticism even as journalists were being arrested and the military jailed a former army chief who tried to run against Mr. Sisi. In a message posted to the United States Embassy’s Twitter feed on Monday, the first day of the vote, the United States chargé d’affaires in Cairo, Thomas H. Goldberger, said: “As Americans we are very impressed by the enthusiasm and patriotism of Egyptian voters.” Timothy E. Kaldas, a nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said the statement sent the wrong message to Mr. Sisi. “To put out an image like that, without any context of the repression that has marred and undermined the credibility of the vote, puts the U.S. government in a position of being complicit with the repression,” he said. A spokesman for the embassy declined to comment. A handful of American observers, invited to monitor the vote by Egyptian officials, praised the vote in enthusiastic social media postings that showed the observers dancing with voters or eating with Sisi supporters. One of the observers, Samantha Nerove, is a military veteran who runs a nonprofit called America Matters. Two others, Andy Braner and Sasha Toperich, wrote an online article before the vote that concluded “We should give el-Sisi a chance.” Mr. Sisi has jailed tens of thousands of opponents, mostly from the banned Muslim Brotherhood. But he needs a strong showing to anchor his legitimacy as he presses the fight against Islamic State militants in Sinai and presses tough economic changes that are badly squeezing poor Egyptians. Under Egyptian law, Mr. Sisi can serve only one more term and must leave office in 2022. He has denied speculation that he will amend the Constitution to extend or abolish those term limits. Mr. Sisi, then a general, came to power in 2013 after he led a military takeover that ousted the democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, after a mass uprising. Mr. Morsi, who was sentenced to 20 years in connection with the killing of protesters in 2012 and is still on trial on espionage charges, remains imprisoned at the Tora maximum security prison, also known as Scorpion, south of Cairo. His family says he is suffering from ill health and recently enlisted five British members of Parliament and lawyers to draw attention to his plight. The group requested permission from the Egyptian government to visit Mr. Morsi in prison to assess his conditions, it said Wednesday. They did not receive a reply.",The New York Times
2018,Egypt’s Election Should Be a Lock. So Why Is President Sisi Worried?,"CAIRO — Days before Egypt’s presidential election, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s beaming visage adorns billboards across Egypt. His rivals are in jail, the news media is in his pocket and his sole challenger — a politician so obscure many Egyptians would struggle to name him — hasn’t bothered to campaign. With the Irish bookmaker Paddy Power putting Mr. Sisi’s odds of losing at 1 in 500, most Egypt watchers are already looking past the vote that starts Monday to his next challenge: whether he can change the Constitution to extend his rule beyond the current eight-year limit. The mystery, then, is why Mr. Sisi is acting like a man with something to lose. As the election loomed, the Egyptian leader sometimes acted in ways that looked oddly jittery. He fired his army chief in October and a powerful spy chief in January. In speeches, he struck a choleric, sometimes threatening tone, railing against unspecified enemies. In a fierce media crackdown in the final month of campaigning, the government expelled a British reporter without explanation and even imprisoned a pro-Sisi TV host deemed to have stepped out line. “It’s very confusing,” said Mohamed Anwar el-Sadat, a presidential contender who quit the race in January out of concern for the safety of his campaign workers. “Sisi has everything in hand. So why the fear?” The reason, experts and diplomats in Cairo say, lies within the precincts of true power in Egypt — the military and security agencies that form the bedrock of Mr. Sisi’s authority. While the vote is expected to be a stage-managed confirmation, along the lines of those in China and Russia last weekend, it has exposed a rumble of discontent inside the security establishment that appeared to rattle Mr. Sisi. Tensions spiked in the early stages of the election when two former generals stepped forward to challenge him. He quickly dispatched their bids — one man is in jail while the second, after a month in detention, disavowed his ambitions. Few analysts gave either candidate much chance of beating Mr. Sisi, who retains broad support for his tough policies against Islamist militancy. But his unsparing reaction to their bids stoked speculation that they enjoyed support from a corner of the security establishment, a smidgen of dissent that Mr. Sisi found intolerable. The security apparatus, which removed Mr. Sisi’s predecessor in 2013, poses the only real challenge to his power, said Robert Springborg, an Egypt scholar at King’s College. “The election puts that into relief,” he said. “It provides the shadows on the wall of the struggle that’s going on underneath.” Egypt’s modern leaders are often likened to pharaohs — all-powerful leaders of a disciplined state. Mr. Sisi has encouraged that image, whether standing imperiously at the prow of a boat plowing through the Suez Canal, or posing against the backdrop of the pyramids. But a more apt historical analogy, some say, lies with the Mamluks, a fractious military caste that ruled Egypt in the Middle Ages. For almost three centuries, Mamluk sultans ruled from Cairo’s citadel, but their supremacy rested on a cabal of restless subordinates who jockeyed for supremacy. Under Mr. Sisi, a tight circle of generals and security chiefs wield vast economic and political power, overseeing secretive business and media empires while cracking down on any hint of opposition. Deciphering the inner workings of this circle is notoriously difficult, and the subject of a sort of Kremlinology among Western officials. But this year’s election seemed to crack open the lid on hidden strains. That the two retired generals would run for office was no surprise. Ahmed Shafik, a former air force commander who served briefly as prime minister in 2011, ran for president in 2012. Sami Anan, who led Egypt’s army from 2005 to 2012, backed out of the 2014 presidential election after he was attacked in pro-state news media. But this time they offered rare public criticism of Mr. Sisi and proposed to loosen his harsh rule. Mr. Shafik, in his video message to launch his campaign, said: “A true democracy and basic human rights are not a given.” Mr. Anan tendered an olive branch to the young revolutionaries who helped oust President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, and who have been hounded by Mr. Sisi. Mr. Anan was charged with breaching military rules and thrown in jail, where aides say he has been interrogated by military officers in balaclavas. Mr. Shafik was detained at a luxury hotel for a month before he publicly withdrew his candidacy. A third military-linked candidate, an American-educated officer named Col. Ahmed Konsowa, was court-martialed in December and sentenced to six years imprisonment. “Their attempted candidacies said to the Egyptian public that Sisi is doing a bad job and Egypt needs new leadership,” said Amy Hawthorne, an Egypt expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “That’s very provocative.” Mr. Sisi rejected the notion that he pushed the other candidates out of the race. “It is not my fault,” he said in a television interview on Tuesday. “I swear to God I wished there would have been more candidates for people to choose who they want. But they were not ready yet. There is no shame in this.” With his rivals derailed, Mr. Sisi sought to shore up his own military credentials. He announced a sweeping military drive against Islamic State militants in Sinai and last month donned his old army uniform to open a new military command center. In improvised remarks in January, he warned that Egypt’s security would be compromised “over the dead body of the military” — a statement that appeared to be aimed as much at internal critics as at the militants. And he increased pressure on the news media. A journalist who interviewed Mr. Anan’s running mate was jailed. Last month, the government expelled Bel Trew, a reporter with The Times of London, despite a private protest from the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The news organization says it has not received an explanation. To some analysts, Mr. Sisi is merely consolidating his power as he heads into a second four-year term. Despite the repression, many Egyptians still support him as an antidote to the turmoil they suffered after the Arab Spring. The economy is improving as a result of tough economic reforms, many prescribed by the International Monetary Fund, even if they have inflicted painful inflation on tens of millions of poor Egyptians. Mr. Sisi also enjoys the support of powerful foreign allies like President Donald J. Trump and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, who paid Mr. Sisi a three-day visit this month. He has drawn closer to Egypt’s old enemy, Israel, through discreet cooperation on counterterrorist operations in Sinai. But Mr. Sisi has also made many contentious decisions. The military’s prominent role in running the economy is unpopular with businessmen and some military officers, a senior western diplomat in Cairo said. The decision to hand two Red Sea islands, Tiran and Sanafir, to Saudi Arabia in 2016 was opposed by several senior defense officials, Ms. Hawthorne said, citing Egyptian media reports. “I think it’s a vulnerability for Sisi,” she said. “He can try to move past it but people don’t forget.” Although Mr. Sisi has faced talk of dissent before — in 2015 a military court reportedly convicted 26 officers on charges of plotting to overthrow him — experts say he is believed to enjoy staunch support among the military high command. But they also note that he is tightening his inner circle, relying more heavily on his family. One son, Mahmoud, is a senior figure in the General Intelligence Service and has been an interlocutor in meetings with American officials in Washington. Another son works in an influential anti-corruption body. Whatever Mr. Sisi’s popularity may be, this election will not be a reliable indicator. Egypt’s weak, fractured opposition has already written it off. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that briefly enjoyed power until the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power in 2013, is outlawed. Mr. Sisi’s only challenger, Moussa Moustapha Moussa, held just two public events, one of which was attended by more journalists than supporters. “I’m no puppet,” he insisted to The Guardian this week. On Wednesday, Mr. Sisi called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory last weekend, having also congratulated China’s Xi Jinping on his unanimous election in the National People’s Congress. Both leaders have found way to circumvent term limits, and there are signs that Mr. Sisi has similar ambitions. Last August, a member of Parliament loyal to Mr. Sisi proposed a constitutional amendment to extend term limits. In November, Mr. Sisi insisted he would not seek any changes. Mr. Sadat, the opposition politician and nephew of his namesake, Egypt’s former president, said a broad coalition of opposition groups had started to hunt for candidate to contest the 2022 election — when, if the proposed constitutional changes take place, they expect to face Mr. Sisi again. “Sisi hates politics and that’s what we are seeing in this election,” he said. “What worries me is what will come next. Are we going to see a Chinese model? That is the issue.”",The New York Times
2018,"Eight Dead, Including Two Children, in Fierce Nor’easter","At least eight people died after heavy snow, rain and high winds ripped through the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic on Friday, snarling travel and bringing major flooding to parts of Massachusetts. More than two million people in 17 states and Washington, D.C., were without power as of Friday night, the United States Energy Department said on its website. By about 9:30 p.m. Saturday, at least one million people were still dealing with electricity failure. The deaths, reported in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia, included two children. An 11-year-old boy in Putnam Valley, N.Y., died after a large tree fell and crashed into a home, trapping the boy, the Putnam County Sheriff’s Department said. A similar thing happened to a child in Chesterfield County, Va. The fire chief there said the child was in bed when a tree limb struck his home, fatally injuring him. The adults who died in the storm were also killed by falling trees. In Massachusetts, it took more than four hours to extricate a man who was killed when a large tree fell on his car on Friday during the height of the storm, Warren Borsari, the fire chief in Plympton, Mass., said in a phone interview. In Upper Merion Township, Pa., a 40-foot portion of a tree fell, crushing a car and killing a man inside it, the police chief there said. The storm’s effects were felt as far south as Georgia and as far north as Maine. In Rhode Island, the winds were so severe that officials shut down the Newport Bridge. In New York City, most flights were grounded for a time on Friday afternoon. In the Washington suburbs, downed trees were strewn across the streets. Weather officials said more than three feet of snow blanketed some parts of New York State on Friday. Meteorologists confirmed Friday that the storm had become the second “bomb cyclone” in two months. (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.) Coastal flooding damaged homes, closed roads and sent at least one car floating down a street; many areas of New England got two to four inches of rain. In Quincy, Mass., there were more than 100 rescues on Friday as floodwaters drove people from their homes, the television station WBZ reported. “As far as a coastal storm, this is the worst since the blizzard of ’78,” said Mayor Thomas Koch of Quincy. “Across the board this is the most damaging, and I’m very concerned about the infrastructure damage.” Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts activated the National Guard, which mobilized 53 vehicles to help assist with evacuation and rescue efforts. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf activated the National Guard on Friday to respond to the severe weather in the eastern part of the state, where Monroe County, in the Poconos about 80 miles northwest of New York City, was hit with nearly two feet of snow and wind gusts that knocked electrical wires and trees into the roads. Cars and trucks spun out of control, shutting down Interstates 80 and 380, stranding hundreds of vehicles. “It’s quite a unique storm with the amount of snow that came down that quickly,” Sean Brown, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, said in an interview on Saturday. “It has been nonstop,” Lorenzo Thompson, a manager at the Burger King in Gouldsboro, Pa., near Interstate 380, said in a phone interview on Saturday morning. “I have not stopped taking orders since 7:30 a.m.” One bus passenger, Angie Cortz, told WPXI on Saturday that said she had been on the vehicle on Interstate 80 since Friday afternoon. “They said that we were stuck due to accidents in the road,” she said. State troopers brought her and the other passengers some water as they continued to wait, she said. Travel ground to a halt elsewhere as more than 3,000 flights were canceled and more than 3,500 others were delayed across the country on Friday, many at coastal airports in the storm’s path, according to FlightAware. Amtrak suspended service along its Northeast Corridor. The wind gusts made for turbulent trips for those who did fly. A pilot on a plane headed to Washington Dulles International Airport sent a report to the Aviation Weather Center that painted an unsettling image of the flight. The center, which is run by the National Weather Service, recounted the report in a tweet that said: “Pretty much everyone on the plane threw up. Pilots were on the verge of throwing up.” As conditions began to improve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, winds and coastal flooding remained a concern, Patrick Burke, a lead forecaster with the Weather Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a phone interview on Saturday. “One of the more pertinent threats that continues into the weekend is coastal flooding from Delaware on up all the way to Portland, Maine, and that would include Long Island and the New York City metro area,” he said. The winds had slowed to 45 miles per hour in some areas, a departure from reported winds on Friday that exceeded 65 m.p.h., Mr. Burke said. The highest recorded gusts were 93 m.p.h. in Barnstable, Mass. On the heels of the nor’easter, a “modest-sized storm” will be making make its way across the Rockies and Central Plains, eventually arriving in the Northeast on Wednesday, Tony Fracasso, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said in a phone interview. “It doesn’t look like it’s going to be as strong as the one that just went through yesterday,” he said, but it will bring at least a few inches of snow in the interior regions of the Northeast, and more rain to the coastal areas. “There’s always the potential for something stronger than what we’re forecasting,” he added.",The New York Times
2018,El Al Sues Israel After Air India Flies Through Saudi Airspace,"TEL AVIV — The Israeli government has hailed Air India’s new nonstop service from New Delhi to Tel Aviv as a historic breakthrough — the Indian carrier is the first commercial airline to take a geopolitical shortcut through Saudi Arabian airspace. But Israel’s national airline, El Al, still has to take the long way and fears that it will suffer serious financial damage from what it views as aerial discrimination. So in a first of its own, El Al petitioned Israel’s Supreme Court on Wednesday, filing suit against the government; the Civil Aviation Authority; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; the transportation minister, Yisrael Katz; and Air India. Flying in a straight line cuts more than two hours off the usual flight time, and allows Air India to lower its ticket price. Even though Saudi Arabia granted permission for the route, El Al is asking the Israeli court to prevent Air India from taking the shorter path unless the Israeli carrier receives a similar permit. The dispute was touched off by Air India’s inaugural flight last week from New Delhi. As is the case with most of its neighbors in the Middle East, Israel does not have formal diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis have for decades banned jets traveling to or from Israel from crossing their airspace. The informal web of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia is usually maintained well below the radar, and the flyover permit granted to Air India is being seen in Israel as an unusually visible sign of improved ties as the old foes’ interests have converged over issues like curbing Iran’s influence in the region. “The Israeli skies are connecting with the Saudi Arabian skies in one direct flight,” Mr. Katz, the transportation minister, said in a statement after greeting the maiden Air India flight on the tarmac in Tel Aviv. Saudi Arabia has not publicly commented on the matter. Mr. Netanyahu has been similarly opaque, avoiding mentioning Saudi Arabia by name in his remarks at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday. “Air India flew directly to Israel, on a straight line from India to Tel Aviv,” he said. “The significance is clear to all. This is significant economically, technologically, diplomatically and for tourism.” El Al contends that Air India now has an advantage that violates the principle of fair competition and policies meant to ensure equal opportunities between Israeli airlines and foreign carriers. “The permit that Saudi gave to Air India to fly over its territory to Israel is a global precedent,” Eli Defes, the chairman of El Al’s board, said in an interview last week at the airline’s offices at Ben Gurion Airport. “According to all the international organizations we checked with, there is no similar phenomenon anywhere in the world.” To illustrate the perceived injustice, he added, “It’s as if British Airways were allowed to fly a short route between London and New York while United Airlines or Delta were obligated to fly to London via Africa.” For years, El Al has been the sole airline operating direct flights to India, flying four times a week between Tel Aviv and Mumbai. El Al planes have to take a circuitous route, flying low along the Red Sea and across the Arabian Sea, circumventing the entire Arabian Peninsula. The additional flight time requires more fuel and a larger crew, driving up the ticket price, according to Mr. Defes. Air India halted its direct flights to Israel via the longer route years ago, but is now flying the New Delhi-Tel Aviv route three times a week, with a flight time of about 7.5 hours. But Mr. Defes fears that the Air India deal will be the start of a trend and that other airlines will obtain permission to fly over Saudi Arabia en route to Israel. Along with its attractive introductory fare, Air India is offering cheap transfers from New Delhi to Thailand, another destination popular with Israelis. There has been talk of government compensation for El Al, but Mr. Defes said it was impossible to assess the scope of the damage given the possibility that other airlines may get permission to fly over Saudi Arabia. El Al has prepared color-coded maps showing the areas from which it is banned from flying over: The air space over much of North Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan and Indonesia are among the no-go zones, requiring significant detours. El Al’s lawyers say that the deal with Air India violates a binding commitment to ensure fair competition and equal opportunities it made with the Israeli government when it was privatized in 1994, as well as international aviation conventions. The airline is asking for an injunction prohibiting Air India flights to Israel over Saudi Arabia until it is afforded the same privilege. Israeli officials have responded with vague prospects that Israeli carriers may soon be granted permission to fly over Saudi Arabia. Mr. Katz wrote on Twitter last week that he hoped this would happen “in the not so distant future.” In response to the court petition on Wednesday, the Transportation Ministry said in a statement that the permission to fly over Saudi Arabia was “a diplomatic achievement of the first order,” but that it was up to the Israeli government to ensure that El Al was not harmed by the development. Mr. Netanyahu said his goal was to introduce shorter, five-hour flights from Tel Aviv to Mumbai, but did not specify if he was referring to flights by El Al or Air India. His office would not elaborate. The Israeli Tourism Ministry has provided Air India with a grant to market its new route, as part of a campaign to encourage Indian tourism in Israel. About 58,000 Indian tourists visited Israel in 2017, according to the Tourism Ministry, up from 34,600 in 2014. “More than 50 million Indians hold passports,” the ministry said. El Al flies about 60,000 Israelis to India per year, about 70 percent of them business travelers. India is also popular with younger Israelis, particularly those who have completed their compulsory army service, but many take cheaper flights via connections in third countries.",The New York Times
2018,Elder Abuse: Sometimes It’s Self-Inflicted,"The New Old Age The man was living alone with his two dogs, in a remote area outside San Antonio, when someone called the Texas state hotline to report that a supposed friend was financially exploiting him. So the state adult protective services agency sent a caseworker to the man’s home. She found an 86-year-old Vietnam veteran in a dirty, cluttered house full of empty liquor bottles. His legs swollen by chronic cellulitis, he could barely walk, so he used a scooter. He missed doctor’s appointments. He had the medications he needed for cellulitis and diabetes, but didn’t take them. Though he had a functioning toilet, he preferred to urinate into plastic gallon jugs. He didn’t clean up after his dogs. He wasn’t eating well. This behavior pointed to an underrecognized problem called self-neglect. It accounts for more calls to adult protective services agencies nationwide than any other form of elder abuse. Yet efforts to identify and help older people who neglect themselves often collide with Americans’ emphasis on self-determination. “If someone has decision-making capacity, do they have the right to live in squalor?” asked Dr. XinQi Dong, a researcher at the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging in Chicago. “As a society, we want to respect autonomy and independence.” In the Texan’s case, “he wasn’t happy that A.P.S. was there, and he denied that he was being exploited,” said Raymond Kirsch, an agency investigator who became involved. “He also denied that he had a drinking problem.” Grudgingly, he allowed the agency to set up a thorough housecleaning, to start sending a home care aide and to arrange for Meals on Wheels. But on a follow-up visit a month later, the caseworker found her client markedly deteriorated. His swollen legs now oozed. He’d become personally filthy and was ranting incoherently. She returned with an ambulance and a doctor who determined that the client lacked the capacity to make medical decisions. Off he went to a San Antonio hospital, under an emergency court order. The caseworker locked up the house and kenneled the dogs. We hear much more about other kinds of elder abuse and exploitation. Perhaps it’s easier to respond when someone is being victimized by others than when he is harming himself. “Family members get fed up and don’t want to get involved,” said Courtney Reynolds, a research analyst at the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging in Cleveland. “They attribute it to a character issue, like stubbornness, instead of a decline in the person’s ability to manage.” Self-neglect refers to someone whose behavior threatens her health and safety. In ongoing studies in Chicago, Dr. Dong and his colleagues look for factors like hoarding (of objects or animals), poor personal hygiene and unsanitary conditions. “People can have sores or lice or pests in the house. They may have medical issues but not be taking medications as prescribed,” added Ms. Reynolds, who has seen self-neglect as a social worker. “There could be piles of garbage, or food stored in a refrigerator that’s not working.” That’s why self-neglect may go undetected at medical appointments. “If someone comes into my office wearing a clean shirt and pants, I wouldn’t know they’re hoarding at home,” said Dr. Dong, a geriatrician. “You have to observe their living environment.” In the Chicago studies, involving more than 4,600 South Side residents over age 65, researchers who conducted in-home interviews found self-neglect unnervingly common. It occurred in 9 to 10 percent of men and 7.5 to 8.5 percent of women, depending on age. Because some residents refused access to their homes, “it wouldn’t surprise me if the prevalence were higher,” Dr. Dong said. Neglect was more common among those with poor health and cognitive impairment. African-Americans and those with lower income and education had far higher rates of self-neglect. (In a separate Chicago study, so did Chinese-Americans.) Mental illness and social isolation are demonstrated risk factors, but among the many unanswered questions, Dr. Dong said, is cause and effect. Do depressed people neglect their care, or do people who self-neglect then become depressed? Whatever the underlying causes, “it’s incredibly dangerous,” Dr. Dong said. People who neglect themselves have higher rates of illness and death, of emergency room visits and hospitalization. They’re more apt to suffer other forms of elder abuse as well. As the syndrome draws greater attention — the American Society on Aging’s national conference in San Francisco this month will address self-neglect — other questions arise. Though state adult protective services agencies take on such cases, laws about reporting neglect and abuse vary widely. “In most states, there’s a laundry list of people who have to report, typically doctors and social workers,” said Andrew Capehart, former assistant director of the National Adult Protective Services Association. Several states have added financial services employees and clergy to the list. In Texas, everybody is a mandated reporter — any relative, neighbor or even passer-by — while New York has no reporting requirements. A few states don’t include self-neglect as a form of abuse that agencies will investigate. Even when self-neglect gets reported, state agencies are “often overworked, understaffed and underfunded,” Dr. Dong said. Moreover, with limited research and a dearth of strategies and treatments shown to help, “we really don’t know how to deal with these cases.” Still, reporting suspected self-neglect to an agency is the starting point. Families may hesitate to invite government involvement, “but that idea of us kicking in doors and hauling people out to nursing homes is so wrong,” Mr. Kirsch said. “Our goal is to keep people in their homes as long as humanly possible — but safely.” Sometimes, these stories have reasonably happy endings. Dr. Dong worked for months with a depressed patient in her late 60s who suffered from chronic pain from arthritis and diabetic nerve damage but wasn’t taking her medication. A home visit revealed that she was hoarding, and tripping over cords plugged into overloaded electrical outlets. Her children had been selling the OxyContin Dr. Dong had prescribed, he eventually learned, but she was afraid to tell anyone. Over time, he changed her drug regimen, sent physical therapists and visiting nurses to her home, and helped her lose weight. Her home remains cluttered with bags, boxes and newspapers. But as she became more mobile, able to join activities at her church and community center, she grew less isolated and her mood improved. “This needs to be a systemwide response,” Dr. Dong said. “It took a lot to mobilize all this.” In San Antonio, Mr. Kirsch also has success stories — and some with more disturbing outcomes. The 86-year-old vet, for example, rebounded during a month in a hospital nursing home. “Because he was receiving three square meals a day and wasn’t drinking, and was taking his meds, he did unbelievably well,” Mr. Kirsch said. So well that at his next court appearance, a county judge and nursing home physicians agreed the man had regained legal capacity. He could make his own decisions — and his decision was to go home to his dogs. Mr. Kirsch, on hand for the homecoming, saw that the man’s friend had restocked the house with alcohol. And once back in his house, the client announced that he wanted nothing further to do with offers of help from adult protective services. “My heart sank,” Mr. Kirsch said. “You know it’s not going to get better.” But there was nothing more the agency could do. “We had to close his case and bow out.”",The New York Times
2018,"Eli Leon, 82, Dies; Champion of African-American Quilt Makers","Eli Leon, a psychologist, writer and collector and self-taught scholar of African-American quilts, who helped bring attention to the field and especially the quilts of Rosie Lee Tompkins, died on March 6 in Emeryville, Calif. He was 82. The cause was septic shock, said Jenny Hurth, a close friend and the executor of his estate. Mr. Leon, who died at a care facility, had learned he had primary progressive aphasia in 2012. Mr. Leon was an obsessive collector — or, perhaps more accurately, a highly discriminating hoarder. Every wall and shelf of his small Craftsman bungalow on Dover Street in Oakland, Calif., where he had lived since 1962, was lined with carefully arranged small, everyday objects and idiosyncratic thrift-store finds, many of them green. There were tiny dolls and dollhouse furniture set up in vignettes, baskets made of Popsicle sticks, Depression glass, trivets made of bottle caps crocheted together, rows of shaving brushes and egg timers, and, especially impressive, a collection of at least 30 meat grinders installed on a shelf running the width of his kitchen. The display included his own work: shoe boxes decorated with collages of bright cutout paper, tie-dye fabrics, and posters he designed, many of which advertised programs at the Berkeley Free University. But he’ll be most remembered for his passion for African-American quilts, especially those of the artist Rosie Lee Tompkins (1936-2006), whom he met at a flea market in the Oakland area in 1985. Ms. Tompkins is so far the only woman in the pantheon of great self-taught artists — among them Bill Traylor, Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and James Castle — whose achievements came to light in the second half of the 20th century and have altered the shape of American art history. Several of these artists had what might be called, for lack of a better word, saviors: individuals who encountered their work, recognized its significance and were instrumental in preserving it and bringing it to a broader audience. Mr. Leon was Rosie Lee Tompkins’s savior. “Eli Leon turned the full force of his exceptional intelligence and visual acumen onto the field of African-American quilts,” Lawrence Rinder, director of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, told The San Francisco Chronicle. “His exhibitions and publications, as well as his phenomenal collections, leave a profound legacy.” Robert Stanley Leon was born in the Bronx on June 27, 1935, the son of Benjamin and Sylvia Leon. His father was a jeweler and watch repairman, and his parents, first-generation Jews from Lithuania, ran a small accessory shop on the Lower East Side. He attended the High School of Music and Art, where his interests included poetry, graphics and ceramics. While still in high school, he spent a summer at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, studying with the potter Karen Karnes. After high school, Mr. Leon entered Oberlin College in Ohio before transferring to Reed College in Portland, Ore., where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in psychology in 1958. He then earned a master’s from the University of Chicago, where he trained in Reichian psychotherapy, the practice of which became his main source of income. In the late 1950s and early ’60s, he was briefly married to his college girlfriend, Anne Drummond, although they both knew he was gay. Sometime after that he changed his first name to Eli. In the 1970s, Mr. Leon became a regular at flea markets in and around Oakland, buying quilts of all kinds. In short order, he decided to concentrate on African-American quilts because their irregular, improvisatory patterns appealed to him. He began asking people at flea markets if they knew of any local quilt makers. One day he approached Ms. Tompkins as she was selling household items at a flea market. As he later wrote, “She was evasive, but eventually let on that she herself dabbled in the craft.” Dazzled by her work, he began to buy whatever she would sell him while also buying from other members of a large community of African-American quilt makers in the Oakland area. Over 30 years he accrued a collection of around 3,500 quilts, including some 200 by Ms. Tompkins. (With his death, how that collection will be disposed of is not yet known.) Mr. Leon also began studying the quilts, relating their ad hoc patterns to textiles made in West Africa. And he made trips to the area of northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana and southern Arkansas, where many of the African-American quilt makers he knew in California had come from, visiting their relatives, interviewing them and buying more quilts. In 1989, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship to conduct research in the South. Mr. Leon organized his first exhibition of quilts from his collection in 1987 at the San Francisco Craft and Folk Art Museum under the title “Who’d a Thought It: Improvisation in African-American Quiltmaking.” He would go on to organize nearly a dozen exhibitions across the country. After seeing Ms. Tompkins’s work in a show that Mr. Leon had organized at the Richmond Art Center, Mr. Rinder, then a curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, organized her first solo exhibition in 1997. He also included her quilts in the 2000 Whitney Biennial while working as a curator at the Whitney Museum in New York. The most ambitious of Mr. Leon’s shows was “Accidentally on Purpose: The Aesthetic Management of Irregularities in African Textiles and African-American Quilts,” held at the Figge Art Museum in Davenport, Iowa, in 2006, the year Ms. Tompkins died. Mr. Leon’s house was filled with quilts. One had to negotiate among two-foot-high piles of them in his living room — even though he had built a garage-size climate-controlled addition to contain the overflow. Ms. Hurth spoke of efforts to get things under control. One year she helped stage a sale of the many Anglo quilts that Mr. Leon had acquired and in which he was no longer interested. But, she said, he was willing to part with only six. Asked if Mr. Leon had made any quilts himself, Ms. Hurth said he had — seven of them — to keep himself occupied while he was waiting to hear about the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1989. But she said he might have intended to make more. Clearing out the quilts from his attic after he moved to the care facility in November 2016, Ms. Hurth discovered that the floor beneath them was covered edge to edge with at least 12 inches of clothing and vintage fabric.

2018,Elite Schools Make Few Offers to Black and Latino Students,"When running for mayor in 2013, Bill de Blasio said the city’s elite high schools had to “reflect the city better.” But according to data released by the education department on Wednesday, black and Latino students made up only 10 percent of those offered spots for next fall at the eight high schools that administer the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, a percentage that has been essentially unchanged for years. Admission to the schools is based solely on the single-day test; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, another specialized school, admits students by audition and a review of academic records. The schools have long been criticized for not being representative of the overall population of the city’s school system, which is 67 percent black and Latino. In his first mayoral campaign, Mr. de Blasio pledged to overhaul the schools’ admissions process, moving to a system that took into account multiple criteria. But, since being elected, he has not made any significant effort to do that. (Changing the admissions process for the three original schools, Stuyvesant High School, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Tech, would require state legislation, which he has not pushed for.) Instead, the city has taken more modest steps, including expanding a free after-school test-preparation program and offering the admissions test during the school day at some middle schools that historically have not sent many students to the specialized schools. In the fall, the city revamped the exam, scrapping a section in which students had to take paragraphs with sentences that had been scrambled and reassemble them. The education department said the changes would make the test more equitable by better reflecting what students actually learn in school. Despite these efforts, the percentage of students admitted to the specialized schools who are black or Hispanic is actually down slightly from before Mr. de Blasio was elected. In 2013, 12 percent of students who received offers were black or Latino. At Stuyvesant, the most competitive of the schools, only 10 black students and 27 Latino students received offers this year; last year, the comparable numbers were 13 and 28. Matt Gonzales, the director of the School Diversity Project at New York Appleseed, an organization that advocates for school integration, and a member of a group that is advising the city on how to integrate schools, said that he was not surprised, given that the mayor had not made any substantive effort to change the admissions process. “I question the premise that we need to have specialized high schools,” Mr. Gonzales said, calling them “undemocratic.” Nonetheless, he said, if the city wanted to maintain the schools, there were ways to make them more reflective of the city’s population — such as instituting a system in which the top students at every middle school were offered admission. More incremental steps, he said, were not likely to make a difference. “Without a massive overhaul of how we enroll in these schools,” he said, “I don’t really see a dramatic change happening.” Douglas Cohen, a spokesman for the education department, said in an email that, “We’ve seen encouraging results from several of our specialized high school diversity initiatives, and know there’s a lot more work ahead of us.”",The New York Times

2018,"Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos C.E.O. and Silicon Valley Star, Accused of Fraud","Holding up a few drops of blood, Elizabeth Holmes became a darling of Silicon Valley by promising that her company’s new device would give everyday Americans unlimited control over their health with a single finger prick. Ms. Holmes, a Stanford University dropout who founded her company, Theranos, at age 19, captivated investors and the public with her invention: a technology cheaply done at a local drugstore that could detect a range of illnesses, from diabetes to cancer. With that carefully crafted pitch, Ms. Holmes, whose striking stage presence in a uniform of black turtlenecks drew comparisons to Steve Jobs, became an overnight celebrity, featured on magazine covers and richest-woman lists and in glowing articles. Her fall — and the near-collapse of Theranos — has been equally dramatic in the last few years. On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ms. Holmes, now 34, with widespread fraud, accusing her of exaggerating — even lying — about her technology while raising $700 million from investors. The company, whose valuation was once estimated at $9 billion, has skirted bankruptcy and is now barely afloat. Ms. Holmes was exceptionally secretive about the private company’s finances and its intellectual property. In announcing the charges, the S.E.C. said that Theranos and Ms. Holmes had agreed to a settlement, with Ms. Holmes agreeing to pay a $500,000 penalty. Ms. Holmes, who clung to her position as chief executive even after revelations about Theranos first surfaced three years ago, will be stripped of control of her company. She is barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for 10 years. She and the company did not admit or deny the allegations, and the settlement will have to be approved in court, the S.E.C. said. A lawyer for Ms. Holmes, John Dwyer, declined to comment. Theranos said in a statement that it was “pleased to be bringing this matter to a close and looks forward to advancing its technology.” The troubled arc of Ms. Holmes’s reign over the company has stunned Silicon Valley investors and served as a cautionary counterpoint to the success stories of other self-made billionaires, like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. “There are a handful of people who, whether through vision or communication skills or both, can rally employees and investors and the ecosystem to try and do something big,” said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock who invests in health start-ups. “Arguably she was one of those people.” “This is Silicon Valley hubris in force,” said Lakshman Ramamurthy, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration and currently the global regulatory lead at Foundation Medicine. At its height, Theranos was viewed as the tech world’s answer to the nation’s antiquated and high-cost health care system — heralded as another example of how Silicon Valley would disrupt major industries. Through its proprietary “nanotainer” devices, the company claimed to be able to perform myriad lab tests from just a few drops of blood, avoiding the pain and inconvenience of a conventional blood test. In a vote of confidence, Walgreens signed onto a partnership in 2013 placing Theranos “wellness centers” inside some of its drugstores. Prominent venture capitalists soon signed on, including Timothy Draper, Ms. Holmes’s former neighbor, and Don Lucas, an early investor in Oracle. Ms. Holmes also assembled a star-studded board of directors, including the former secretaries of state George P. Shultz and Henry A. Kissinger as well as two former United States senators. Gen. Jim Mattis, the current secretary of defense, also served on the board: He told Fortune magazine in 2014 that he joined the board after retiring from the military because he was impressed by the strength of Theranos’s leadership. In October 2015, Ms. Holmes, in her signature turtleneck, appeared on the cover of Inc. magazine, next to the headline “The Next Steve Jobs.” That month marked a turning point: A series of articles in The Wall Street Journal cast doubt on whether the technology worked, leading to a spate of investigations. The well-known lawyer David Boies not only defended Theranos, but also joined the board at the height of the company’s turmoil. The company faces a separate federal criminal inquiry, in which no charges have been filed yet. In 2016, federal regulators barred Ms. Holmes from owning and operating a medical laboratory for two years, sanctions that Theranos said it would appeal. Later that year, Theranos announced it was closing its lab and laying off about 340 employees, or more than 40 percent of its work force. Walgreens also sued Theranos over a breach of contract, although the companies later settled for an undisclosed amount. The S.E.C. complaint made public Wednesday outlined a concerted effort by Ms. Holmes and Theranos to exaggerate the company’s technology, when in fact the vast majority of the tests it was conducting were done using traditional equipment made by other companies. Ms. Holmes also claimed that the Defense Department was deploying the company’s test in battlefield settings, which was untrue, according to the complaint. Ms. Holmes and the company even went so far as to demonstrate their product on potential investors, the S.E.C. said, drawing their blood through a finger stick and placing it in one of Theranos’s nanotainers. But while investors thought their blood was being tested with the company’s technology, Theranos “often actually tested their blood on third-party analyzers, because Theranos could not conduct all of the tests it offered prospective investors on its proprietary analyzers,” according to the complaint. “The Theranos story is an important lesson for Silicon Valley,” Jina L. Choi, director of the S.E.C.’s San Francisco regional office, said in a statement. “Innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday.” Theranos’s saga has proved mesmerizing: Tyler Shultz, the grandson of the former secretary of state and a Theranos director, was revealed to be a key source behind The Wall Street Journal’s investigation in 2016. A former Theranos employee, Mr. Shultz is described as cooperating with federal investigators on matters that pitted him against his grandfather, a key adviser to Ms. Holmes. Jennifer Lawrence will play Ms. Holmes in a forthcoming movie. The company’s future remains unclear. In an attempt to salvage her company two years ago, Ms. Holmes tried to pivot Theranos away from conducting lab tests to developing a miniature lab testing machine that could be used in doctors’ offices. It was able to raise $100 million in debt last December, according to Crunchbase. But unlike another highly scrutinized testing company, 23andMe, which faced a moratorium by the Food and Drug Administration on its genetic tests in 2013 but was recently allowed to begin offering certain tests directly to consumers, Theranos “is a contrasting tale,” Mr. Ramamurthy said. In a separate complaint, the S.E.C. also accused Theranos’s former president, Ramesh Balwani, of participating in the fraud. The commission said it planned to pursue its claims against Mr. Balwani in Federal District Court for the Northern District of California. Jeffrey B. Coopersmith, Mr. Balwani’s lawyer, described the S.E.C.’s actions Wednesday as “unwarranted.” In a statement, Mr. Coopersmith said Mr. Balwani, who is known as Sunny, “believed in the potential and mission of the company and its technology to promote transparency and benefit people by empowering them with access to their own health care information at a low cost.” Mr. Balwani invested millions of dollars in Theranos, Mr. Coopersmith said, and “never benefited financially from his work at the company.”",The New York Times
2018,Elon Musk Joins #DeleteFacebook With a Barrage of Tweets,"Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology. On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans. Mr. Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, deleted the Facebook pages of both of his companies. In doing so, he joined a growing chorus of tech leaders calling for people to abandon Mr. Zuckerberg’s social network after it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain and misuse data on 50 million users. The revelations have plunged Facebook into its worst public relations crisis in years. As with most news in 2018, Mr. Musk’s decision started with a barrage of tweets. The tech luminary began by criticizing Sonos, a maker of wireless speakers, which had pulled some ads from Facebook for a week. “Wow, a whole week. Risky ...,” Mr. Musk tweeted in response to a news article about Sonos’s move. A minute later, he replied to Brian Acton, the founder of WhatsApp, which Facebook had acquired for $19 billion several years ago. Mr. Acton, who has since left Facebook, had on Wednesday called for people to “#deletefacebook.” “What’s Facebook?” Mr. Musk replied to Mr. Acton. Then Mr. Musk announced he would shut down the SpaceX and Tesla pages. He said the Tesla Facebook page “looks lame anyway.” The posts, which sent the Twittersphere into a virtual frenzy, escalated a public feud between Mr. Musk and Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Musk has often urged people to be cautious of embracing technology such as artificial intelligence because of the consequences it might bring, once saying that it could become so powerful it would start wars and turn people into its “house cats.” Mr. Zuckerberg has argued that people need to trust and embrace technology in their lives. When the Facebook chief executive was asked about Mr. Musk’s warnings around artificial intelligence during a Facebook Live broadcast in 2017, he called Mr. Musk a “naysayer.” That’s an insult in a technology world that celebrates perpetual optimism. “With A.I. especially, I’m really optimistic,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “People who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don’t understand it. I think it’s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.” In response, Mr. Musk shot back that Mr. Zuckerberg did not fully comprehend the issues. “I’ve talked to Mark about this,” Mr. Musk wrote. “His understanding of the subject is limited.” The two have also clashed on space travel. Mr. Zuckerberg traveled to Kenya in 2016 for the launch of a Facebook-affiliated satellite called Amos-6, which was set to go to outer space in a SpaceX rocket. But the rocket exploded. Mr. Zuckerberg released a chilly statement. “As I’m here in Africa, I’m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent,” he wrote on Facebook. Mr. Musk is a frequent Twitter presence, who has posted increasingly macho and humor-focused messages including video of himself playing with a flamethrower. He said he plans to keep using his Instagram account, which is owned by Facebook, and on which he has 6.9 million followers. When one reporter said on Twitter that it was remarkable Mr. Musk had so much time to troll online, Mr. Musk wrote, “What, a troll, me!?” Facebook and SpaceX didn’t immediately have a comment on Mr. Musk’s deleted pages. A Tesla spokeswoman did not have a comment beyond Mr. Musk’s tweets.",The New York Times
2018,"Emails Contradict Ben Carson’s Claims About $31,000 Dining Set for Office","Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, and his wife were directly involved in selecting a $31,000 custom mahogany dining room set for his office — contrary to Mr. Carson’s claim that the decision was handled by subordinates, newly obtained documents show. In an August email, the department’s administrative officer referred to “printouts of the furniture the secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out,” according to a 163-page cache of emails obtained by American Oversight, a Washington-based watchdog group, under the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Carson’s wife, Candy Carson, played a central role in coordinating the redecoration of his office suite — down to scheduling an appointment with an interior decorator, reviewing photo boards of furniture choices last summer and pressuring staff members to find more money for furnishings, according to the emails. The correspondence came as the Trump administration proposed extensive cuts to the department. It also reveals that senior HUD staff members scrambled to figure out ways to reconcile Mrs. Carson’s demands for major upgrades to the outdated office suite with federal laws that prohibit expenditures of more than $5,000 on office furniture without congressional approval. The emails contain vivid descriptions of the “wobbling” chairs and table. In one message, a top HUD official, Sheila Greenwood, wrote that she feared one of the chairs might collapse under a visitor — which she described as a potential “embarrassment.” At least one of Mr. Carson’s predecessors — Shaun Donovan, who served under President Barack Obama — abandoned the idea of replacing the furniture when told it would exceed the statutory price limit, according to two former agency officials. Frustrated with the lack of resources, Mr. Donovan paid for several pieces of modern furniture out of his own pocket, the former officials said. (The furniture has since been put in storage.) Last spring, HUD staff members and lawyers concurred with Mr. Donovan’s assessment and counseled Mr. Carson and his advisers against making any purchase over $5,000 regardless of the need. But by the summer, the emails show, there was an abrupt about-face coinciding with the reassignment of a senior staff member, Helen G. Foster, who has claimed in a whistle-blower complaint that she refused to comply with Mrs. Carson’s request to “find the money” to fund a more lavish renovation. In August, the department’s administrative officer, Aida Rodriguez, wrote to other department officials that a $24,666 quote for the dining room table, chairs and hutch was “a very reasonable price and the funds are available.” “We also have a justification for the cost (as you know, the furniture hasn’t been changed since 1988) so this should not be a problem,” Ms. Rodriguez wrote to Mr. Carson’s executive assistant, Allison Mills. Ms. Rodriguez also sent senior agency officials a detailed estimate of the dining room set provided by a Baltimore-based vendor. It included $4,097 for the 12-foot mahogany table and base, $6,488 for the “Jefferson Sideboard” and more than $7,000 for 10 chairs. For reasons that are not clear, about $7,000 in additional costs were added when the expense was logged in a federal procurement database in December. A department spokesman, Raffi Williams, said the money was legally allocated because the dining room table served an agencywide function and did not strictly fall under the restrictions placed on the redecoration of the secretary’s office. Mr. Carson has said he was not aware of how expensive the dining room set was and requested that the order be canceled after the purchase, which has prompted an investigation by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, was revealed in news reports. The emails document a lengthy back and forth between Mr. Carson’s wife and his closest aides over the smallest details of the dining room set, including a dozen swatches detailing the fabrics available for the chairs, which were reviewed by Mrs. Carson. “When presented with options by professional staff, Mrs. Carson participated in the selection of specific styles,” Mr. Williams said on Wednesday. Mr. Carson, the emails show, was also interested in other improvements. In August, around the time the dining room set was ordered, he asked his staff if he could use any of his furniture allowance to commission a portrait for HUD secretaries not included in the phalanx of oil paintings in the corridor outside his office. There are currently no portraits of Mr. Donovan; his successor, Julián Castro; or Mr. Carson. The department’s lawyers said that the portraits cost $25,000 each and that federal law prohibited the use of taxpayer funds “for the painting of a portrait” of any government official. “This prohibition applies to the HUD secretary,” a lawyer said in an Aug. 22 email to Ms. Rodriguez.",The New York Times
2018,"Emboldened Turkey Pushes Deeper Into Syria, but Risks Abound","KILIS, Turkey — After two months of uncertain fighting, Turkey appears suddenly to be riding high in its military campaign to take control of a larger piece of northern Syria. Along the border, studded with spring flowers and pistachio and olive groves, the artillery guns and fighter jets that until recently pounded the low mountains have fallen silent since Turkish forces captured the enclave of Afrin last weekend. The victory has been widely celebrated in Turkey and has further emboldened President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has vowed to take his campaign across northern Syria and even into Iraq. Yet the road ahead for Turkey in Syria is uncertain and fraught with risks. The deepening inroads of Turkey and its allies have been tolerated so far by the two powers that control Syria’s airspace, Russia and the United States. But Turkey may yet meet resistance if it pushes much further. There is every risk that Turkey, which has a less than illustrious history dealing with its Kurdish population, could find itself embroiled in a guerrilla war in Syria, an extension of its decades’ old battle against the Kurdish insurgency at home led by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K. “Afrin is not a region easy to command for Turkey,” said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director in Turkey of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “Not only is the majority of the population there Kurdish, but an important part of the population is sympathetic to the P.K.K.” Even Turks’ euphoria surrounding their sudden win in Afrin was quickly tempered by the messy aftermath of that battle. No sooner had Turkey’s proxies on the ground, the Free Syrian Army, captured Afrin city than social media lit up with video and messages depicting looting by its fighters. The environment remains volatile. A booby trap planted in Afrin killed seven civilians and four Free Syrian Army soldiers this week. A Syrian journalist was among those killed, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported. Yet the fall of Afrin has made it increasingly clear that Turkey and its allies will have to be reckoned with in whatever negotiation might eventually end the seven-year conflict. “Turkey and the F.S.A. have become an undeniable force in Syria,” Mr. Unluhisarcikli said, referring to the Free Syrian Army. The deepening engagement places Turkey in the middle of the fight between the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who is backed by Russia, and the rebel groups determined to remove him from power. Some of those rebel groups are supported by the United States, but are bitterly opposed to Turkey and its proxies. Afrin’s capture changes things on the ground. It opens a link between parts of northern Syria, where Turkish forces maintain a presence, and the rebel-held western province of Idlib, where Turkey has been steadily expanding its presence. About two million people live in Idlib, half of them displaced from elsewhere in Syria, and they are under daily attack from Syrian government and Russian airstrikes. The opposition is dominated by radical Islamist groups, and Russia has been pushing Turkey to contain the rebels. But Turkey has been reluctant so far to confront the strongest among them, a Qaeda-linked group, Tahrir al-Sham. Flush with success, its Free Syrian Army allies are first set on pushing eastward from Afrin, and on to the city of Manbij. Along the way is a string of 15 Arab villages from which many of the Free Syrian Army fighters taking part in the operation have been displaced. The villages are now controlled by the same Kurdish group ousted from Afrin, known as the People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., which the United States has supported to combat the Islamic State. “The question is, can it be settled by way of negotiation with the U.S.,” said Sinan Ulgen, chairman of the Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies in Istanbul. Turkish officials say they have agreed to the outlines of a plan with the Americans for the Y.P.G. to withdraw to east of the Euphrates River. That could allow Turkey and the United States to undertake a joint operation in Manbij, and to avoid a confrontation between the NATO allies. But, Mr. Ulgen said, the United States has been sending conflicting signals, with the State Department working on a compromise, and the Pentagon and American commanders in the region resisting moves against the Y.P.G. An agreement between the United States and Turkey over Manbij could usher in a new era of collaboration between them in Syria after mounting tensions. “Manbij is important for reinstituting the confidence between the U.S. and Turkey,” Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. “If an agreement is reached with the U.S. about Manbij, it will have an enormously important effect on Turkey-U.S. relations.” Mr. Erdogan seemed to indicate that he was ready to work with the United States on a joint effort to secure the city and region. “If you are strategic partners with us, you should show us respect and walk with us,” Mr. Erdogan said on Tuesday at a weekly gathering of lawmakers from his party. He has insisted that Turkey’s aim is to secure areas where the hundreds of thousands of displaced Syrians — many of whom now live in Turkey — could return and run their own lives. One showcase for that effort is the town of Jarabulus, 100 miles east of Afrin, which Turkey sees as a blueprint for Afrin. Eager to show off its successful administration of areas of northern Syria under Turkish protection, the Turkish government arranged a rare visit for The New York Times. Liberated from the Islamic State in 2016, Jarabulus is now run by a local Syrian council of teachers and engineers, most of whom took part in the original uprising against the Assad government. A Turkish civil servant, Dr. Yasar Aksanyar, serves as deputy governor, coordinating reconstruction and humanitarian assistance, and the Turkish military, along with the Free Syrian Army, provides security. “The local council makes the decisions, but we provide the experience,” he said. The main challenge was infrastructure, the lack of government services, water and electricity, he said. A doctor and humanitarian administrator, he added that his priority was to help disadvantaged groups. The small border town is swollen to over twice its original population, with people displaced from all over Syria, and Turkish assistance does not go far. People in a makeshift camp complained they had received no assistance in months. But with Turkey’s help, the administration has opened a hospital and over 100 schools. The town is busy, with commerce and construction sites on every street. Some Syrians, as well as Turks, condemn the presence of the Turkish military in Syria as a colonial exercise. But the Turkish presence has allowed those opposed to the Assad government to live freely without the threat of bombings. Many of those there today said that Jarabulus was preferable to the repression they had experienced under the Assad government or radical Islamists, and to the compulsory conscription the Y.P.G. enforced in areas it controls. One man, Saleh Khodor, a doctor from the southern city of Deir al-Zour, pushed through the crowd and interrupted the deputy governor to address his visitors. “I have lived in almost all areas of Syria, under the Islamic State, the Syrian Democratic Forces and now here,” he said. “Ninety percent of Syrians would come, if they had the chance to live in this area.” He paid smugglers and traveled 15 days from the south with his family to reach Jarabulus. “I came for the security, second for the schools, and third, it’s a job opportunity,” he said. “It’s safe, it has freedom of speech.”",The New York Times
2018,"Embracing China, Facebook and Himself, Cambodia’s Ruler Digs In","STUNG TRANG, Cambodia — As the sun rose over the murk of the Mekong River, the man who has ruled Cambodia for more than three decades, Prime Minister Hun Sen, clasped hands with the Chinese ambassador and beamed. “The Chinese leaders respect me highly and treat me as an equal,” Mr. Hun Sen said last month during the groundbreaking of a $57 million Chinese-funded bridge in the district of Stung Trang. “Let me ask those of you who have accused me of being too close to China,” he added. “What have you offered me besides cursing and disciplining me and threatening to put sanctions on me?” For a quarter-century, the West helped rebuild Cambodia while it was still reeling from the genocidal Khmer Rouge. The United States and Europe tied billions of dollars in aid to an effort to transform Cambodia into a liberal democracy. That campaign has failed. Instead, Cambodia has come to stand as the highest watermark for China’s influence in Southeast Asia and as the stage for Mr. Hun Sen’s evolution into one of Asia’s most unstinting autocrats. Mr. Hun Sen, 65, likes to be known as Lord Prime Minister and Supreme Military Commander, and has said he plans to stay in power for another decade or two. He’s making sure of it: His government has dissolved Cambodia’s main opposition party ahead of general elections set for July, jailed dozens of critics and shuttered dissenting news media outlets. In Senate elections late last month, his Cambodian People’s Party swept all seats on offer. Mr. Hun Sen’s enduring grip on power has been supported by China’s largess, which comes without the West’s admonishments to protect human rights and democratic institutions. “Having alienated Western partners, Hun Sen will rely on Beijing’s political and financial support, drawing Cambodia closer to China as a result,” concluded a worldwide threat assessment by the United States intelligence community. Mr. Hun Sen’s authoritarian descent reflects an overall retreat of democracy across Southeast Asia. There is also a perception across the region that the United States under President Trump has withdrawn its influence, leaving China free to exercise its clout. While some countries, like Vietnam, nurse historic grievances with China and have tried to resist its economic magnetism, others, like Laos and Cambodia, seem on the path toward becoming client states of Beijing. “Cambodia is in danger of returning to being a totalitarian state,” said Mao Monyvann, a Cambodian former opposition lawmaker. “And the worst thing is that Hun Sen looked around and he saw that China supported him and that America was not punishing other Asian countries for doing similar things, so he just went ahead with his crackdown.” China is Cambodia’s largest benefactor, providing the country with nearly one-third of its foreign investment last year. Beijing has gifted Cambodia 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers. “In terms of funding for infrastructure, we welcome any country that’s willing,” said Sun Chanthol, Cambodia’s minister for public works and transport. “But so far, only the Chinese are responding so generously.” The United States and other Western countries are retreating further. On Feb. 27, the Trump administration announced it was cutting aid to Cambodia because the country’s Senate elections “failed to represent the genuine will of the Cambodian people.” And Germany last month placed visa restrictions on members of the Cambodian government, including on Mr. Hun Sen. Mr. Hun Sen has long condemned Western powers for treating Cambodians as pawns in a geopolitical game. He has a point: The French colonized Cambodia and the Americans bombed the countryside. A state-building experiment by the United Nations spread graft. But his government’s accusations have grown increasingly outlandish. Dissenting voices have been branded as Western agents. Kem Sokha, the leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, was detained in September and charged with treason, accused of plotting a United States-funded coup. He denies the charges. “The U.S. wants to break up Cambodia and destroy our country,” said Phay Siphan, a government spokesman. “The U.S. is paranoid and wants the Cambodian government to be weak so it can come back to this region and chase China away.” During his 33 years leading Cambodia, Mr. Hun Sen has displayed a faultless sense of when to switch sides. The son of farmers became a fighter for the Khmer Rouge, whose murderous rule from 1975 to 1979 resulted in the deaths of about a fifth of the national population. “Yes, we were Khmer Rouge soldiers,” said Dy Bit, Mr. Hun Sen’s cousin. “There was nothing else to do.” Mr. Dy Bit’s sister and neighbor were beaten to death by the radical communists. “Some us killed,” he said, “and some of us were killed.” But in 1977, Mr. Hun Sen defected to neighboring Vietnam. When Vietnamese troops ejected the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh two years later, Mr. Hun Sen, at 26, returned as the world’s youngest foreign minister. By the time the United Nations arrived in 1992 to administer a transitional authority, Mr. Hun Sen was firmly in control of Cambodia. He later sidelined his co-prime minister, whose party had won elections in 1993. Throughout his political reinventions, perhaps only Mr. Hun Sen’s antipathy toward the United States has remained unchanged. He grew up in a wooden house near the Mekong, in a province that was heavily bombed by the Americans as the Vietnam War spilled across the border. While he led the puppet administration installed by the Vietnamese, Mr. Hun Sen chafed at the fact that the United States refused to recognize his government. Instead, Washington, still smarting over its retreat from Vietnam, pushed for Cambodia to be represented at the United Nations by the Khmer Rouge, which still held a corner of the country. Mr. Hun Sen has never been invited to the White House. But he has traveled to Beijing numerous times, and in 2016, President Xi Jinping of China visited Cambodia. Shortly before Mr. Xi’s trip, Mr. Hun Sen’s government shielded Beijing from mild criticism by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of China’s expansive claims to the South China Sea. During his visit, Mr. Xi described the two countries as “good neighbors, real friends who are loyal to each other.” Mr. Hun Sen’s supporters suggest that Beijing is more sympathetic to his authoritarian impulses because that is the natural state of affairs in Asia. “We only respect one ruler because in our history there was only one king,” said Mr. Phay Siphan, the government spokesman. “The Chinese understand this because they have closer blood to us.” Mr. Hun Sen, however, has also borrowed from Mr. Trump’s playbook. At the Mekong bridge ceremony, Mr. Hun Sen pointed out New York Times journalists in the crowd and noted that the newspaper had been given “fake news” awards by Mr. Trump. He then warned that if The Times’s report was not suitably positive, “the Cambodian people will remember your faces.” Other times, he has been more direct. In a speech on March 3, Mr. Hun Sen called William A. Heidt, the United States ambassador to Cambodia, a “liar ambassador.” Mr. Hun Sen has proved adept at using social media. The public relations firm Burson-Marsteller says that his interactions on Facebook make him the third-most engaged leader in the world, although the opposition accuses Mr. Hun Sen of buying his “likes” through click farms. On a cool February morning, Mr. Hun Sen addressed 10,000 young garment workers on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The speech was broadcast live on Facebook, and a stream of hearts and thumbs up floated across Mr. Hun Sen’s page. After the hourlong talk, which strayed into the merits of drinking one’s own urine and his recent struggle with diarrhea, Mr. Hun Sen posed for photos with members of the crowd. Every worker was given the equivalent of $5 in cash in an envelope that specified the money was a gift from Mr. Hun Sen and his wife, Bun Rany. Yet his Cambodian People’s Party is not assured of the youth vote in the election scheduled for July 29. In the last election, in 2013, the opposition, buoyed by support from young Cambodians, threatened to unseat the ruling party. Mr. Hun Sen’s campaign strategy has been to position his government as the sole guarantor of peace in Cambodia. “Without us, there would still be war, and you wouldn’t have the choice to work in factories,” he told the garment workers. Yet nearly 70 percent of Cambodia’s population is younger than 30. They have known no other leader but Mr. Hun Sen, and they appear eager for change. Mr. Hun Sen, though, seems keen to keep politics a family concern. He has put his youngest son, Hun Many, in charge of courting the nation’s youth. Currently Cambodia’s second-youngest lawmaker, Mr. Hun Many has expressed interest in becoming prime minister. Mr. Hun Sen’s eldest son, Hun Manet, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, is widely considered to be angling for the job of commander in chief. The prime minister’s second son, Hun Manith, is rising in the intelligence services. “We have to remember that democracy is an important pillar, but it is not the only one,” said Mr. Hun Many, who was educated in the United States and Australia. Mr. Hun Sen’s Chinese backers echo the importance of stability. “Under the leadership of Lord Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia has maintained peaceful development and enjoyed lively economic growth,” Xiong Bo, the Chinese ambassador, said at the Mekong ceremony. Cambodia achieved 6.9 percent economic growth last year. In 2005, half of Cambodians lived below the poverty line. Less than a decade later, fewer than 14 percent did. But even as millions of rural residents have graduated to factory work, expectations are rising along with income levels. Security officers have responded to workers’ protests with bullets. That puts all the more pressure on Mr. Hun Sen to attract Chinese money. Western investors have been put off by Cambodia’s endemic corruption, not to mention the official anti-Western rhetoric. In Sihanoukville, business is booming. In the coastal backwater once popular with Western backpackers, 20 new casinos have opened in the past two years. A dozen more are scheduled to begin operations this year. The clientele is almost exclusively from China; Chinese arrivals to Sihanoukville rose by nearly 200 percent last year. On day five of business at the Chinese-owned New MGM casino last month, Chinese gamblers could be seen placing bets of $100,000 in the V.I.P. room. Chinese managers oversaw the till while Cambodian prostitutes napped nearby. Mr. Hun Sen’s vacation villa is across the street from the New MGM. In late January, Yun Min, the governor of Preah Sihanouk Province, wrote an internal report warning that so many Chinese workers had descended on Sihanoukville that the local economy was suffering. He denounced the influence of Chinese gangsters. “Some mischievous people,” he cautioned in the report, might use Sihanoukville’s makeover “to attack and influence the Cambodia-China relationship.” Mr. Hun Sen publicly dismissed Mr. Yun Min’s criticism. Less than a week later, the governor seemed chastened. “Like in any family, we might have disagreements with China,” said Mr. Yun Min, sitting in his office, a Chinese construction crane hovering above. “But our Lord Prime Minister Hun Sen is very clear that we still love our family.”",The New York Times
2018,"Emergency Plan Spends Modestly on Signals, Subway’s Biggest Woe","After Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency for New York City’s subways last year, transit officials unveiled an emergency repair plan to address the most pressing needs quickly. Yet the plan invests a relatively modest amount in the equipment that many experts say is the backbone of the subway: the signaling system, which dates to before World War II. Of the $378 million the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has so far set aside for the plan, 15 percent, or about $58 million, is dedicated to the signals that direct traffic on one of the world’s busiest systems, according to financial statements the agency released this month. The original cost of the subway action plan was $836 million, but that number was based on New York City providing half the cost. Mayor Bill de Blasio has so far refused to do so, arguing that people who live or work in New York City already contribute 70 percent of the state-run agency’s revenue. “Given the amount of controversy around the subway action plan and who pays, governor or mayor, does the subway action plan spending match up with the problems causing the delays right now?” asked John Kaehny, of Reinvent Albany, a government watchdog group. “It raises the question — and this is an open question — is the subway rider getting the biggest bang for the buck here in terms of reducing delays?” Moving the subway away from its antiquated method known as block signaling to a more modern and reliable technology is essential if the system is to become more dependable and capable of carrying a growing city into the future, experts and officials said. Under the current system, which in some cases includes cloth-covered cables, trains have to be spaced out a safe distance apart because the signals cannot pinpoint exactly where trains are. And even as major subway delays have declined slightly since the emergency repair plan started last summer, the number of significant disruptions caused by signal malfunctions has remained largely unchanged, according to M.T.A. data. Transit officials strongly rejected the notion that too little money was being spent on signals, pointing out that the plan devotes a significant amount of spending to issues that are related to the signal system. Those include repairing tracks to prevent trains from tripping signals to red, sealing leaks that can make signals sputter and improving the delivery of power as part of $202 million in electrical work by Con Edison. “Ultimately, the majority of things we are doing on the subway action plan ties back to the reliability of the signals, which ties back to the reliability of the customer’s commute,” said Phil Eng, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s chief operating officer. Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the agency, said any criticism that transit officials are not focusing enough on signals was politically motivated. “The idea that track and infrastructure work is not tied to signal work is remarkably uninformed,” Mr. Weinstein said. Transit officials have long acknowledged the need to upgrade the signaling system, but the M.T.A. began focusing on the problem two decades ago and has little to show for its efforts. It took a decade to install a new system on just one of the city’s 22 subway lines, the L train. A second line, the No. 7, was supposed to get a new system by the end of 2017, but it is still not finished. At the current pace, the agency is on track to modernize its signals in 50 years, according to a 2014 report issued by Regional Plan Association, an urban research group. The transit agency has recently begun discussing accelerating the projects, said Richard Barone, the association’s vice president for transportation, an ambitious goal with a hefty cost. “If you want to get it done that fast, you are going need more money,” he said. Under the subway action plan, the agency is spending $24 million on operating costs for signals and an additional $34 million on capital expenditures for signals, which is intended for future improvements. “The subway action plan is so we can stabilize the system for the customers, enabling us the opportunity to modernize the system through the capital program,” Mr. Eng said. But Mr. Kaehny questioned why the action plan, intended for immediate fixes to swiftly stabilize the crumbling system, has a capital portion in the first place. “This money on the operating side is buying time so that the modern signals, the modern rails, all of that, can come online over time,” he said. “The M.T.A. already has a gigantic capital budget.” Indeed, the agency’s current five-year capital plan for subways is $14.5 billion, of which $2.7 billion is set aside for signals and communications work — with nearly $1 billion of that allocation for work on just three subway corridors. Benjamin Kabak, who writes the Second Ave. Sagas subway blog, described the action plan’s spending on signals as “token” and said it failed to address the key issue: There is as yet no plan to overhaul signals at a faster rate. “Millions starts the project, but it doesn’t get you where you need to go,” Mr. Kabak said. “It’s not what you’d expect to see if they said they are seriously going after the signal problem.”",The New York Times
2018,"Emily Nasrallah, Lebanese Novelist and Activist, Dies at 86","Emily Nasrallah, a prizewinning Lebanese writer whose novels struggled with bigotry against women, the horrors of civil war and the vacuum left by fleeing refugees, died on Tuesday in Beirut. She was 86. “Lebanon and the Arab world lost an icon of literature and Lebanese creativity, and a women’s rights activist,” Prime Minister Saad Hariri said in announcing the death. Ms. Nasrallah, who was also a journalist, a teacher, a lecturer, and a women’s rights advocate, was best known in Lebanon, but some of her books were translated and published abroad. Wherever they were read, they struck a responsive chord. “You really travel through the pages,” Sirene Harb, an associate professor of comparative literature at the American University of Beirut, told The Associated Press. “It’s not anymore a book that you have in front of you, it’s something you have inside of you.” Ms. Nasrallah’s novels were tragic narratives of alienation, arranged marriages and unfulfilled love — stories of young women torn between strict village traditions and emerging rights trying to shape their lives as members of societies in transition. They recount the emptiness left by immigration, the women left behind by men seeking a better life beyond war-torn Lebanon, the parents abandoned by children desperate to fulfill the dreams they had been denied. Emily Daoud Abi Rached was born on July 6, 1931, in Kfeir, in southern Lebanon to Daoud Abi Rached and Loutfa Abou Nasr. Education in her village at the foot of Mount Hermon was rudimentary, but after completing the third grade, she appealed to an uncle, a businessman in West Virginia, who agreed to subsidize her education at the Choueifat National College, a boarding school in suburban Beirut. She was still a teenager in college when one of her teachers encouraged a local magazine to publish her work. In 1957, she married Philip Nasrallah, a chemist from Zahle, Lebanon. They raised four children, Ramzi, Maha, Khalil and Mona, who survive her. “I believe that children are a source of inspiration,” Ms. Nasrallah once said. “The writer who is a mother sees in her children the history of humanity,” She graduated from what is now the Lebanese American University in Beirut in 1958 with a bachelor’s degree in education and literature and published her first novel, “Birds of September,” in 1962. Her five siblings had left Lebanon for Canada, but Ms. Nasrallah steadfastly remained, even during the civil war that began in 1975 and lasted into the ’80s. She joined what became known as the Beirut Decentrists — a group of writers, all women, who were physically and intellectually scattered over “a self-destructing city,” as Professor Miriam Cooke of Duke University put it. Even in her children’s books, Mr. Nasrallah would hardly sugarcoat the horrors of military conflict. In “A Cat’s Diary” (1998), she chronicled war through the journal of a cat left to fend for itself by a family who had fled the fighting. Last year, the German cultural organization the Goethe Institute awarded her the Goethe Medal, an official decoration that honors non-Germans. Last month, President Michel Aoun of Lebanon honored her as a commander of the National Order of the Cedar. “I am not a feminist writer,” Ms. Nasrallah told The Daily Star of Lebanon in 2004. But she championed respect for women, not only those who, like her, had fled to more cosmopolitan lives, but also the friends and classmates she had left behind in rural villages. “These women have maintained an original language and worldview which is not spoiled by outside influences,” she said. For Ms. Nasrallah and the other Decentrists, Beirut during the civil war became a metaphor for the villages they had abandoned. “Nasrallah redefined Lebanon, the sick child, as a village,” Professor Cooke wrote in “War’s Other Voices: Women Writers on the Lebanese Civil War” (1987). “Hence, those who had left the village recovered through the war their lost identity, and with it their right to belong and to call themselves Lebanese.”",The New York Times
2018,Emmanuel Macron Becomes France’s Answer to Strongman Populism,"PARIS — The plush red velvet seats of France’s National Assembly are filled with lawmakers who owe just about everything to President Emmanuel Macron. Three-quarters of the 577 members are brand new, swept into power in the wake of his election last year. More than 60 percent are in his camp. Nearly one-third have never held public office, and 38 were under the age of 31 when they entered office. They are perfect foot soldiers for a president with an expansive notion of power and the revolutionary aim of wrenching France’s society and economy into the 21st century. With the assembly firmly in his control, Mr. Macron has had almost unchecked authority to carry out his agenda, even as critics fret that he is building a fawning cult of personality. On Thursday, tens of thousands of railway workers, teachers and air traffic controllers went on strike across France to protest salary freezes for civil servants and Mr. Macron’s pledge to cut 120,000 public-sector jobs and introduce merit-based pay and use more private contractors. But the anger on the streets has found little expression in the legislature, where Mr. Macron has been given free rein to ram through major legislation. The symbiotic relationship between Mr. Macron and a legislature made in his image is a hopeful sign to his many supporters that the sclerotic French politics of the past few decades have given way to an era of renewal in a country that has long embraced the principle of a strong presidency. Elected on promises to enact more business-friendly labor laws, put the pension system on sounder footing, cut some taxes on the wealthy and address a host of other issues that his predecessors failed to solve, he has spent his first 10 months in office methodically working through his to-do list. But there is also concern among his critics that a young and inexperienced legislature is deferring to him too much, allowing him at times to govern almost by edict, often bypassing debate and dismissing criticism. “He’s a bad example for democracy, but a good example for reform,” said Patrick Vignal, a survivor from the previous assembly and now a supporter of Mr. Macron in Parliament. He spoke with a grin, but some of his colleagues express similar sentiments with dead seriousness. In fact, Mr. Macron has come to embody a paradox of French politics. Abroad Mr. Macron has been seen as vital European defender of liberal democratic values after France sidestepped the West’s turn to populism by rejecting the far-right National Front in elections last year. But in place of populism, France got a sort of humanist but all-powerful leader who muses aloud about the solitary exercise of power, faces little internal dissent, and has effectively neutered the opposition. Less than a year into his presidency, Mr. Macron’s push to upend France has spawned intense and sometimes overheated reactions. He is routinely if perhaps hyperbolically compared to either Napoleon Bonaparte or Louis XIV in the French press. But there is no appetite to challenge or slow Mr. Macron down in the National Assembly, which is wholly dominated by his newly branded political party, La République en Marche, or the Republic on the Move. The assembly has become a showcase of Mr. Macron’s forceful powers of persuasion and the ways he wants to reshape and update all of France. “There’s been a complete cultural shock,” said Jean-Paul Delevoye, a senior official in Mr. Macron’s government who helped pick his candidates for Parliament. “We’ve completely overturned the sociology of the assembly,” he added. Diet Coke replaced wine as the most popular item at the assembly’s bar. Wine sales had plummeted, stunning the barmen, though they are creeping back up under the influence of long days. Mr. Macron’s acolytes sit through them, unlike their predecessors. Before the rule for a deputy was, arrive Tuesday morning and go home Wednesday evening. Now, many say, Mr. Macron’s deputies come for the whole week. So assiduous are they that “now, it’s hard to find a spot at the restaurant, that’s what strikes me,” said Brigitte Bourguignon, another ex-Socialist who joined Mr. Macron. Among the youthful deputies, common positions are worked out in advance on applications like Telegram, befuddling the old-timers. There is little patience for them in any case. But the ambition is also infused with arrogance, critics say, a charge frequently leveled at Mr. Macron himself. “They give the impression that the world begins with them,” grumbled Boris Vallaud, a rare remaining Socialist. “Before, there were only imbeciles. And all the reforms they are accomplishing are necessarily the best.” “They’re only there by the grace of Emmanuel Macron,” Mr. Vallaud added. “It’s a system of personal allegiance.” For those rare lawmakers who managed to survive the clear-cutting of France’s opposition and traditional political parties from the assembly, the going has not been easy. “There’s an arrogance, a lack of humility,” Mr. Vignal said, without rancor. “We were the ‘saved ones,’ ” he added. “So it was like, ‘Shut up, at least you were saved.’ ” Some of that disdain is evident in the attitudes of the new deputies. “We’re not here for the show of it, like some of these career deputies,” said Benoit Potterie, a member of Mr. Macron’s movement and a political novice who owns a string of optical shops in the north. “We’re here to work, to write laws.” Like him, a fifth of Mr. Macron’s new deputies are what the French term “executives” from either the public or private sectors. Many own small businesses. In the carpeted hallways of the National Assembly, legislative aides and the few remaining opposition deputies mumble about the “sheeping-down” of Parliament — a phrase that recurs frequently. There is little doubt that Mr. Macron is getting what he wants out of his Parliament, sometimes by cutting it out of the picture altogether. Parliament was barely to be seen last year when Mr. Macron forced through changes to France’s rigid labor code to allow companies more flexibility in negotiating directly with workers, and to limit payouts after layoffs. Instead, the president proceeded by special decree, using a rarely used procedure that allowed the National Assembly merely to vote thumbs up or down on the labor reforms — it voted up — but without the power to change or even discuss them. Then, Mr. Macron rammed through the lifting of a tax on wealth, insisting that it was necessary to free capital for investment. Many economists agreed. But apart from a few opposition whimpers there was hardly any debate. In coming weeks he proposes to take on the railway workers — the bête noir of many a French government — again by special decree. Mr. Macron wants to end the hiring-for-life, early retirement and enhanced medical insurance that have contributed to a whopping deficit. But he doesn’t necessarily want Parliament debating it. The steamroller of the reform drive has left France caught somewhere between unease at the plenitude of Mr. Macron’s powers and astonishment at the speed with which he is moving. “Debate is extremely limited,” said Jean-Michel Clément, who broke with the Socialists and joined Mr. Macron. “It’s difficult to debate when you’ve got 300 people.” What discussion there is sometimes resembles back-patting rather than debate, an echo chamber of praise. When Mr. Macron’s transport minister, Élisabeth Borne recently defended her government in Parliament, Mr. Macron’s deputies applauded in unison. Before that, it was pure flattery from the ranks. “You showed unequaled strength,” one of Mr. Macron’s deputies said, lavishing praise on the president’s handpicked prime minister, Edouard Philippe. Others disagreed that the climate had turned sheepish, to a point. “Sure, we invite our people to debate the issues,” said Mr. Delevoye, the senior Macron government official. “But once something is decided, that’s it. The decision has got to be respected.” That appears to suit Mr. Macron. He has made it clear that he doesn’t want much discussion and that power is best exercised alone. “Since I was elected president, I’ve taken the measure of the office’s responsibility, its weight,” Mr. Macron told a group of surprised journalists last month, suddenly ruminating aloud in his trademark philosophical style. “Of the part of solitude that it implies, and of the end of innocence that it announces,” Mr. Macron added loftily. Power is “something ascetic,” Mr. Macron continued. “I am the fruit of a kind of brutality in history, a kind of forcing-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy.” It was an unusually introspective portrait of the exercise of power, and there was only one person in it: Mr. Macron. The president’s many allies in Parliament were invisible, and for good reason. Some of Mr. Macron’s recent initiatives have made it ever more clear that he is not thinking about them very much. He is aiming to limit the rights of members to propose amendments, and he wants to cut back on the number of deputies altogether, by about one-third. For his dedicated supporters in Parliament, subordination is not an issue. Asked whether he had been in disagreement with the government, Mr. Potterie replied: “Ah, no. No. At the margins maybe. But for the moment, no.” In the National Assembly, “it’s true that we don’t challenge the government,” he added. “It’s because we were elected to carry out their program.” That sense of purpose runs deep. “It’s not true that we are simply puppets,” insisted Ms. Bourguignon, the former Socialist. “We’ve got a government that reforms, and we’ve got to follow the government.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Emmerson Mnangagwa: ‘We Are Bringing About the New Zimbabwe’,"Op-Ed Contributor HARARE, Zimbabwe — In November, the Zimbabwean people, led by our youth, went to the streets peacefully and joyfully, determined to have their voices heard. They called for freedom, progress and a new way of doing things. Though supported by the military, this was a popular, peaceful revolution. Watching the events unfold from exile, I was deeply proud of my fellow Zimbabweans. In a major turning point in our history, President Robert Mugabe resigned and the first transition of power in 37 years followed. On Nov. 24, I took office as the new president of Zimbabwe. In the past three months, I have heard the call of my people. I share their vision and am committed to delivering. I am working toward building a new Zimbabwe: a country with a thriving and open economy, jobs for its youth, opportunities for investors, and democracy and equal rights for all. We are starting from a difficult position. Today our economy is struggling, our youth lack opportunities, too many people are unable to afford essential goods, and our infrastructure is stuck in the past. Our recovery strategy is based on creating conditions for an investment-led economic recovery that puts a premium on job creation. In three months, we have secured $3.1 billion worth of commitments from across the world, which will create jobs and opportunities. We are embarking on a journey toward real growth, to empower our people with skills, opportunities and jobs. We will continue taking bold steps to liberalize and introduce greater market forces, building an economy in which enterprise is allowed, encouraged and protected. If we are to succeed in this global economy, we must empower our entrepreneurs and foster innovation at every level. As we put the past behind us and embrace this new dawn, we are calling upon the international community to join us. The creation of a National Peace and Reconciliation Committee, which I recently signed into law, will enable us to move forward now as one united people, part of the greater community of nations. Whatever misunderstandings we may have had in the past, let these make way for a new beginning. Zimbabwe is changing — politically, economically and societally — and we ask those who have punished us in the past to reconsider their sanctions against us. Zimbabwe is a land of potential, but it will be difficult to realize it with the weight of sanctions hanging from our necks. In the past three months, my government has taken significant steps to assuage concerns and assure any skeptics of our intentions. We have published an ambitious, responsible and stabilizing budget aimed at reducing our deficits and committing to repaying our debts. We amended the Indigenization & Economic Empowerment Act, which had constrained foreign ownership of local businesses and discouraged much needed investment. We have now removed this constraint in almost all sectors, sending a clear signal that Zimbabwe is open for business. I wish to assure everyone that all foreign investments will be safe and secure in the new Zimbabwe. Transparency and the rule of law will be key. We have already begun the effort to defeat the corruption that has plagued our nation, including requiring cabinet ministers to declare their assets and creating anti-corruption courts. Many Zimbabweans moved their money out of the country. I offered them amnesty from prosecution if they brought the money back within three months. Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been brought back to Zimbabwe. There are voices both at home and abroad who have sought to convince the world that nothing has changed in Zimbabwe. I refute those unfair and unfounded claims and commit that we are bringing about a new era of transparency, openness and commitment to the rule of law. We continue to work with civil society to ensure that human rights concerns are addressed immediately, opening channels of dialogue with opposition parties, prominent NGOs and international organizations. I commit that in the new Zimbabwe, all citizens will have the right of free speech, free expression and free association. At the heart of this will be free and fair elections, to be held as scheduled in 2018, with all impartial observers who wish to witness the new Zimbabwean democracy at work welcome to attend. I extend that invitation once again. Zimbabwe is changing, and quickly. So in this light I urge the international community to heed the saying, “when the facts change,” change your minds. We cannot remain hostage to our past but instead must look to the future hand in hand with our international partners. The new Zimbabwe fully affirms its place in the family of nations, with all the responsibilities this entails. Those who cling to the sanctions are stuck in the old Zimbabwe — the Zimbabwe of poverty and international isolationism. We are bringing about the new Zimbabwe — a country of hope and opportunity, a country that engages with the world and strives toward prosperity. We invite the international community to partner with us and help us turn our country around. Together we will unlock Zimbabwe’s vast potential and build a new, prosperous and democratic Zimbabwe for all.",The New York Times
2018,Empathy From a Pro,"Metropolitan Diary Dear Diary: In 2002, I was completing my master’s of fine arts degree at a local college. The writing program held a fund-raiser at the Culture Project on Delancey Street. The evening was hosted by George Plimpton and featured a panel of luminaries reading from their work. My professor wanted two students to read as well and I was one of those chosen. Among the impressive lineup that night was a Pulitzer Prize winner, a poet laureate, and some dude from Long Island trying not to hyperventilate. I remember being distracted at the bright wall of light separating the stage from the audience and the awkward sound of my voice coming from the microphone. I finished my selection to polite applause and immediately began to question everything: Had I picked the right story? Did I read it too fast? Does this haircut look stupid? As I returned to my seat, an elegant woman to my left smiled sweetly and reached out to me. I didn’t know if she was congratulating me or if she just she felt sorry for a young man in over his head.

2018,"Ending Secrecy, Israel Says It Bombed Syrian Reactor in 2007","JERUSALEM — Israel’s government on Wednesday publicly confirmed for the first time that it had carried out an audacious 2007 strike against a reactor in Syria that could have produced nuclear weapons fuel, lifting a decade of secrecy surrounding the episode. The country’s leaders used the occasion to warn that, if necessary, Israel would not hesitate to launch similar strikes again. “The government of Israel, the IDF and the Mossad prevented Syria from developing a nuclear capability,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces and the country’s spy agency. “Israel’s policy has been and remains consistent — to prevent our enemies from arming themselves with nuclear weapons.” International tension has been mounting over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, which were supposed to have been contained by a 2015 agreement with the United States and its European allies. Mr. Netanyahu has criticized that deal as a historic mistake and Israel has set off alarms about Iran’s growing influence in Syria, where it is a key ally of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in the country’s seven-year civil war. During that conflict, Israel has carried out scores of other covert strikes in Syria against advanced weapons convoys and stores. President Trump has said that unless the European nations agree to make the deal much stricter, he will back out of it on May 12, renewing suspended sanctions on Tehran. As the strict, decade-old military censorship lifted at 5 a.m., Israelis awoke in a kind of time warp to blaring headlines and dramatic video of the destruction of the reactor, which was supplied to Syria by North Korea. The military revealed details of the operation, code-named Outside the Box, including how warplanes bombed the facility at around 2 a.m. on Sept. 6, 2007. It distributed photographs of the pilots with their faces blocked out to conceal their identities. Accounts of the strike appeared long ago in international news media and former President George W. Bush wrote of it in his memoir, published in 2010. Though Israeli news organizations had fought for years to be able to report on it, they were barred from doing so until now. The censorship was originally meant to allow Israeli and Syrian deniability, avoiding the kind of blatant humiliation that might have pushed Syria’s president to retaliate. Israeli news organizations speculated on Wednesday about why the government lifted the secrecy about the operation. The release also prompted a frenzied, if belated, public fight over who was responsible for the operation — chiefly between former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his defense minister at the time, Ehud Barak. Increasingly urgent appeals by Israeli journalists had forced military censors to reconsider the ban. And former officials pointed to the publication this week of Mr. Olmert’s memoir, which includes his account of the operation. Mr. Barak’s memoir is expected to come out in May. Revisiting the episode may help rehabilitate the reputations of some of the protagonists, particularly Mr. Olmert, who resigned from office in 2008 in disgrace. Already blamed for what many Israelis saw as an unsuccessful war in Lebanon in 2006, he left under a cloud of criminal investigations and was later convicted of corruption charges. He served 16 months in jail before his release last year. In excerpts from his book published in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot on Wednesday, Mr. Olmert accused Mr. Barak, who became defense minister in June 2007, of seeking to delay the attack on the reactor even if that meant waiting until after it had become “hot,” or operational. At that point, any strike could have led to radioactive contamination of a large area. Mr. Olmert contended that Mr. Barak believed Mr. Olmert would soon have to resign, and that Mr. Barak could then carry out the strike himself and reap all the glory. Yediot Ahronot’s publishing house is publishing Mr. Olmert’s book. Mr. Barak denied any such motivation in Israeli media interviews. Describing the atmosphere in Mr. Olmert’s security cabinet as one of “hysteria,” he said his interest had been in making sure the operation was properly planned and that contingencies were in place in case war broke out. Arguments have also surfaced over whether discovery of the Syrian reactor was an intelligence coup or a failure. The definitive intelligence came so late that Israel had to scramble to destroy the facility before it became operational. Amos Yadlin, the military intelligence chief at the time, told reporters on Wednesday that Israel had only the vaguest idea what was happening until months before the attack. Comparing the effort to a jigsaw puzzle, Mr. Yadlin said, “If you basically say that 1,000 parts are giving you a good picture, in 2006, we had, like, 50 parts, only the first suspicions that there is a nuclear program in Syria.” Mr. Yadlin, who now directs the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that a Mossad operation yielded something like “500 parts of the puzzle.” Then “we immediately understood that we are facing a project of a plutonium nuclear reactor which had only one purpose: to produce a nuclear bomb.” From that point, he said, Israel assessed correctly that it had six to nine months to strike before the reactor became operational. According to a vivid 2012 account in The New Yorker, the breakthrough came in March 2007 when Mossad agents raided the Vienna home of Ibrahim Othman, the head of the Syrian Atomic Energy Commission, and extracted valuable information from his computer. Israeli officials calculated that since so few people in Syria knew of the reactor, if Israel carried out an attack and did not take responsibility, Mr. Assad could deny it had happened and not strike back. “Almost nobody in Syria knew about it, not even the chief of staff and the defense minister,” Mr. Yadlin said of the reactor. Amir Peretz, Mr. Barak’s predecessor as defense minister, was involved in the early planning of the raid and related discussions with American officials. He said in an interview that the Israelis would have preferred for the United States to have destroyed the reactor, but quickly understood that they were on their own. Western intelligence agencies had missed the signs of the project, partly because, from satellite pictures, it looked like a farm, he said. “Usually, when somebody sets up a nuclear facility, it is surrounded by fences, antiaircraft batteries, soldiers,” Mr. Peretz said. “This was open — there were animals wandering around.”",The New York Times
2018,Ending Term Limits for China’s Xi Is a Big Deal. Here’s Why.,"The roughly 3,000 delegates of the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature, voted almost unanimously on Sunday to end a two-term limit on the presidency, one of the main leadership posts held by Xi Jinping. While the overwhelming approval by the party-controlled congress was not a surprise, the repercussions go beyond just allowing Mr. Xi to stay on longer. Here’s what is at stake, and why ending the term limit matters. One lesson that China drew from the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution was the danger of concentrating power in one supreme, unassailable leader who ruled for life. In 1982, when China was recovering from that chaotic era, lawmakers approved a new Constitution that said the president and also the vice president “shall serve no more than two consecutive terms.” It is sometimes said that Deng Xiaoping, who led China after Mao, introduced the term limit to prevent the top leader from again becoming too powerful. But that’s not entirely true. Back then the Chinese presidency was not such a powerful post. Deng wielded much of his power informally, without titles or term limits, and through his control of the military. Even so, the politicians and legal experts who drafted China’s 1982 Constitution saw lifelong tenure as a recipe for tyranny, especially in a one-party state. “If someone stays in office for 15 years, the people won’t dare express their opinions to him,” said Fang Yi, one of the framers of the Constitution. “The French president begins with one term of seven years, with an option for a second term. But that’s different. They have opposition parties who pick their faults every day.” The presidential term limit became more important in the 1990s, when Deng prepared to pass power to his successor, Jiang Zemin. Under Deng in the 1980s, there was turmoil in succession, as two protégés were forced to resign following student demonstrations. Deng tried to ensure the success of his final choice, Mr. Jiang, by setting him up in China’s three most powerful posts: Communist Party general secretary, chairman of the commission in charge of the military and the presidency, which Mr. Jiang took over in 1993. But Deng also wanted to ensure that Mr. Jiang did not stay on indefinitely. He started a succession cycle by also promoting Mr. Jiang’s younger heir-apparent, Hu Jintao. Under Mr. Jiang and later Mr. Hu, a new norm formed. The top leader had clear authority because he held all three main posts. But he had to hand them to a successor after about a decade. “The three-in-one leadership system and form — of party general secretary, state president and military commission chairman — is not only necessary but also the most fitting for a great party and a great country like ours,” Mr. Jiang said in 2004. That arrangement allowed two of the most stable transitions of power in China’s modern history, from Mr. Jiang to Mr. Hu in 2002, and then Mr. Hu to Mr. Xi six years ago. In China, the political job that matters most is the general secretary of the Communist Party. The party controls the military and domestic security forces, and sets the policies that the government carries out. China’s presidency lacks the authority of the American and French presidencies. This difference is reflected in language. In Chinese, China’s president is called “zhuxi,” which really translates as “chairman.” Foreign presidents get a different title, “zongtong.” So in effect, Chinese people are referring to Mr. Xi as the “state chairman,” though in English his title is officially translated as “state president” to put him on an even footing with other world leaders. Still, the Chinese presidency is not entirely ceremonial. The president has the power, acting with the legislature, to declare war or a state of emergency. In times of crisis, disagreement between a party leader and president could cause trouble. The presidency has become increasingly prominent thanks to China’s growing global stature. At home, Mr. Xi usually speaks as party leader; abroad, he appears as president, who is the formal head of state. Mr. Xi relishes the prestige of state visits to the White House or Buckingham Palace, which might be awkward if he were not president. The official Chinese news media have said that Mr. Xi wants to abandon the term limit so that he can keep his trinity of leadership posts. According to Xinhua News Agency and other party-run news outlets, having a term limit on just the presidency is unreasonable because neither of Mr. Xi’s other two major posts — party leader and military chairman — has a similar limit. Of course, this argument does not address the other solution to that inconsistency: imposing limits on the party and military posts. His action leaves little doubt that Mr. Xi is clearing the way to remain top leader for a long time to come, and without clear rivals. If the term limit remained, Mr. Xi would have to step down as president at the end of his next five-year term, in 2023. Any successor could potentially become a rival. Mr. Xi seems determined to remain “three-in-one” leader because he sees himself on a historic mission to make China into a great power. Achieving that will take more than a decade, Xi has said. Last year, Mr. Xi showed his intent to stay in power by declining to promote a potential successor into the new Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s most powerful body. Mr. Xi and Mr. Hu both served political apprenticeships in the Standing Committee before taking over. Mr. Xi has produced plenty of surprises in his first five years in power, not least his decision to abolish the term limit before his second term as president had even started. So predicting Mr. Xi’s future steps isn’t easy. Even so, The People’s Daily said earlier this month that ending the presidential term limit does not “imply a system of lifelong leadership.” The point seems to be that while Mr. Xi may be around for a while, he won’t be another Mao, who remained in power even as he grew ill and incoherent with age. But Mr. Xi has not specified how many terms he plans on. Perhaps Mr. Xi himself does not have a firm idea yet. Or perhaps he figures he can enhance his power even further by keeping everyone else guessing.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Endless Trade Wars,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Mr. Trump’s Destructive Trade War” (editorial, March 4): You warn that a trade war including tariffs on steel imports that President Trump wants imposed might harm workers in American steel-using industries like autos, and you say these tariffs will send the United States into a “broader trade war, the likes of which the world hasn’t seen since the Great Depression.” In fact, we have been in trade wars for many years. When China subsidized the investment into enormous excess steel-producing capacity that could be got rid of only by dumping it on world markets, it was in effect declaring a trade war. When China adopted the policy of everything “made in China 2025,” it was declaring a trade war. When Japan allowed its auto producers to control the auto distributors, it was declaring a trade war. When China said Google and Facebook could not operate in China, it was declaring a trade war, and moreover, also declaring an ideological war. Conventional free-trade wisdom has little to do with reality.

2018,Engineer of Florida Bridge Reported Cracks Days Before Collapse,"MIAMI — An engineer reported cracks on a newly installed pedestrian bridge two days before it collapsed on a busy roadway here, killing at least six people, state officials said on Friday. The report, by the lead engineer with the company in charge of the bridge’s design, was made in a voice mail message left for a Florida Department of Transportation employee. That employee was out of the office, however, and did not receive it until Friday, a day after the collapse. The cracking was on the north end of the span but the company did not consider it a safety concern, according to a recording of the message released by the Transportation Department. “We’ve taken a look at it and, uh, obviously some repairs or whatever will have to be done, but from a safety perspective we don’t see that there’s any issue there so we’re not concerned about it from that perspective,” said the engineer, W. Denney Pate. “Although obviously the cracking is not good and something’s going to have to be, you know, done to repair that.” The transportation department said on Friday that “the responsibility to identify and address life-safety issues and properly communicate them is the sole responsibility of the F.I.U. design-build team,” referring to Florida International University, which commissioned the bridge. In a statement, Figg Bridge Engineers, which designed the bridge, said that it was “heartbroken by the loss of life and injuries” and was “carefully examining the steps that our team has taken in the interest of our overarching concern for public safety.” “The evaluation was based on the best available information at that time and indicated that there were no safety issues,” the statement said. “It is important that the agencies responsible for investigating this devastating situation are given the appropriate time in order to accurately identify what factors led to the accident during construction.” Earlier on Friday, the authorities in Miami-Dade County announced that they had called off the search for survivors. Officials were now turning their attention to finding out exactly why the new bridge — hailed as a breakthrough in speedy, safe construction — had given way over the road beneath, killing at least half a dozen people and sending 10 more to hospitals. As a backhoe slowly lifted the rubble off cars, some of them with bodies still inside, investigators said they were only beginning to consider possible failures of engineering, construction and traffic planning. What role, if any, the cracks played in the collapse has yet to be determined. “A crack in a bridge does not necessarily mean it’s unsafe,” said Robert Accetta, an official of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the accident, said at a news conference Friday night. The N.T.S.B. chairman, Robert Sumwalt, said the board has not yet determined on its own if there were cracks. Construction crews were tightening cables on the bridge when it fell, the N.T.S.B. said, which is not unusual after installation. Mr. Accetta said the safety board also would look at whether that process contributed to the collapse, adding that the “point of failure” was still unclear. But the possibility that cracks had occurred — and the question of when the bridge’s builders and designers, and school and state officials, had learned about them — was sure to become a focus of scrutiny and of finger-pointing. Two days after the voice mail message was left, and one day before it was heard, the Florida Department of Transportation said, one of its consultants took part in a meeting with the bridge’s design and construction team. At the meeting the state consultant “was not notified of any life-safety issues, need for additional road closures or requests for any other assistance from FDOT,” the department said. The meeting took place at noon on Thursday. At around 1:30 p.m., the bridge collapsed. “At no point during any of the communications above did Figg or any member of the F.I.U. design-build team ever communicate a life-safety issue,” the state Transportation Department said in its statement. But cracking in the structure was brought to the attention of representatives of the Florida Department of Transportation and the school just before the bridge collapsed, according to F.I.U. The school issued a statement early Saturday saying that during a meeting hours before the collapse, a Figg engineer “delivered a technical presentation regarding the crack and concluded that there were no safety concerns and the crack did not compromise the structural integrity of the bridge.” The meeting, which took place at a trailer on the construction site Thursday morning, was convened by the builder and by Figg “to discuss a crack that appeared on the structure,” and representatives of both F.I.U. and the Florida Department of Transportation attended, the school said in its statement. Another major question is whether Southwest Eighth Street, the busy thoroughfare below the walkway, should have been open when the walkway was undergoing crucial adjustments. The state transportation agency said it had received no requests to close the road. None of the victims had been officially identified Friday night, possibly because their bodies were still buried in their cars. But family members of several missing people feared the worst. Alexa Duran and her friend, Richard Humble, both F.I.U. students, had been stopped in a Toyota 4Runner under the bridge because of a red light ahead. The concrete overhead creaked. Mr. Humble looked up, and saw the structure falling. It crushed the car and squashed his neck, trapping him inside. “I thought when I saw the bridge coming down that I was dead,” he told NBC News. Passers-by freed him. But Ms. Duran, a freshman who lived at home and was close with her parents, often pressing shirts at the family’s dry cleaning business, did not make it out. “She was an angel,” her father, Orlando Duran, said by phone from London, where he was traveling for work, before he got on a plane back to the United States. “She wanted to become a lawyer, and she was so beautiful.” An online fund-raiser for the family of another missing man, Brandon Brownfield, had raised more than $20,000 by Friday evening. “We have not received word about his whereabouts or his medical condition,” Chelsea Brownfield, Mr. Brownfield’s wife, said in an interview. The fund-raiser page said they have three daughters. The $14 million walkway, which was to carry F.I.U. students and other pedestrians over Southwest Eighth Street, was built using “accelerated construction,” a well-regarded method of erecting bridges that avoids the long months of street closings when a structure is built over a road or river. Instead, parts of the bridge are prefabricated away from the site and then moved into place. Bridges made using the accelerated techniques are not more at risk of collapse than others, but moving them into place causes different stresses than what the bridge would normally have to withstand, said Andy Herrmann, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. Mr. Accetta said that the N.T.S.B. had not previously had to investigate an accident involving this kind of bridge. “This is a different design type of bridge,” he said. “It’s not something that we’ve encountered before.” The cables being tightened were at the north end of the bridge, the same end where the cracking was reported on the voice mail message, and the same end where the collapse appeared to begin, based on a widely circulated video of the accident. “Just preliminary, it appears that way, but we still have a lot of work to do,” Mr. Accetta said. An executive at a construction company that was working on the bridge confirmed on Friday that one of his employees had been killed and two others hospitalized. Mike Biesiada, the chief sales and marketing officer for the company, Structural Technologies, said the employee who died was Navaro Brown, 37. “We look forward to learning the cause of the accident so that it’s not repeated ever again,” Mr. Biesiada said. The bridge designers, builders and inspectors were all well-known and influential firms. Figg, based in Tallahassee, has designed a number of significant bridges in the United States, including one on Interstate 35W in Minneapolis that replaced a section that collapsed in 2007, and the iconic Sunshine Skyway Bridge over the mouth of Tampa Bay. In response to questions on Friday, the company said that “no other bridge designed by Figg Bridge Engineers has ever experienced such a collapse.” But a 90-ton segment of a bridge across the Elizabeth River in Virginia collapsed during construction in 2012, leaving four workers with minor injuries. The company was fined $9,800 by the state, according to federal records. The main builder of the F.I.U. bridge, Munilla Construction Management, specializes in roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects, and has a $63.5 million contract with the United States Navy to build a school on the naval base at Guantánamo Bay. It was founded by brothers who were Cuban refugees and whose father, the firm says, owned a construction company in Cuba that was confiscated by Fidel Castro. The company is known for having close relations with and donating to local politicians. A spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the bridge collapse, saying that “due to N.T.S.B. investigation requirements, we will not be able to address any questions pertaining to this construction project.” The bridge had been a point of pride for F.I.U., which has a center devoted to accelerated bridge construction and hosted a “watch party” last Saturday when the bridge was moved into place. The university did not offer a public response Friday night regarding the report of cracks on the bridge. Earlier Friday, Mark B. Rosenberg, the university president, said that the school was conducting its own investigation. “Obviously, everybody is in shock here,” said Mr. Rosenberg, who had been a public champion of the project. “We just want answers, and we’re going to get answers.” One of the first people to reach the accident site, Sgt. Jenna Mendez, who was heading to work at the Sweetwater Police Department, recalled being stunned as she saw the bridge fall about 300 feet in front of her. Her first thought: Why would construction workers do such a thing? “Obviously it was a collapse, but I couldn’t comprehend it,” she said on Friday. “I was thinking: ‘Why did they just block all those lanes of traffic?’” Sergeant Mendez, 36, climbed to the top of the fallen bridge, where she found four wounded construction workers. The only shouting she remembered was her own: “I need rescue! I need doctors!” She started doing chest compressions on one man who was not breathing. A motorist who said she was a doctor was guided by other drivers up the heap, where she helped administer CPR. Sergeant Mendez started crawling under the rubble to see if anyone was trapped. She had momentarily forgotten about the grave danger of sliding beneath a collapsed 950-ton bridge. “Fire rescue started screaming: ‘What are you doing? Do not go under that!’” she said. “Once I stepped back and looked, I realized: ‘There’s nothing I can do, these cars are crushed.’” She stayed at the scene until 10 p.m., went home and gave her children, ages 21, 17, 13, 10 and 3, extra tight hugs, and took some melatonin to help her sleep. “I told my husband, ‘I don’t want to drive under a bridge anymore,’” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Enlightened Sort,"Wordplay SATURDAY PUZZLE — Once again, I come to you to sing the praises of the hard, themeless puzzle. And not just because I have been charged with doing so once a week. Here’s the thing: Memory, where you store your vocabulary, expand and draw on it for tough clues, is stored in a different place in your brain than imagination, where you make creative connections. To me, even if they’re fanciful, those connections add an extra layer of gratification. Today’s puzzle by Damon Gulczynski, for example, touched on one of my own interests (no, not CHEEZ WHIZ, people, have a heart) with two of its clues, 16A and 48A. Both are to do with Eastern religions, Buddhism and Taoism (the painting above is an illustration of a Taoist parable). I was honestly raised with no religion at all, and as a younger person read a bunch of Jack Kerouac and caught his fascination with Buddhism, then had the opportunity to study it a bit in school. I don’t pretend to know much and I didn’t know 16A, but my gray cells were activated enough to look at the world (for a day, at least) through a different lens entirely. I was surprised to find out there were only four debut entries here, and they weren’t really such outlandish terms: POSTERIZE, NUDE SCENE, TATTOOIST and IT’S A WRAP. Very Hollywood, all, and apt for this big award weekend. But otherwise there seemed to be a pretty exotic menagerie, including unfamiliar clues for names like SANTO, EDER and OMAR; a bunch of slangy expressions (including a couple of long ones — EXCUSE YOU, LAZYBONES); a ton of abbreviations and shortcuts, many of which solvers are primed to pick up on — REM, IPO, OPED — and a couple of oddballs, to me at least, like PARA and ASTI. 1A: Truth be told, most of my waking hours are devoted to you people, but my actual day job depends on knowing technology. I’d seen and used “rasterize” before, a process that converts type, for example, to pixels on an image. This is more visible and artistic; Andy Warhol and Shepard Fairey, for example, famously POSTERIZE. You can, too, of course. 15A: Loved this clue! “Way out in space,” man! I’d never seen the “Far Out Space Nuts” show — it preceded me by a little, and to the best of my knowledge never made it to Nick at Nite like some other Bob Denver vehicles — but I equated those two phrases in meaning. Turns out “way” is the meaningful word here, as in, “Oh no, what’s that alarm about, is there a way out? Where’s the ESCAPE POD?” 16A: I found the northeast corner of this puzzle extremely hard Even after I got LAZYBONES and STETS I fixated on this clue, trying to make fit bodhi or “bodhisattva,” who is that person who attains enlightenment, reaches nirvana and selflessly chooses to help others do so rather than just relax and enjoy it alone. This word, ARHAT, was unfamiliar to me, although it’s been an answer before in the puzzle. So is an arhat a bodhi, and vice versa? Well, all exist. 66A: Why is ARISTOTLE the “Father of Zoology?” Well, as far back as 340 B.C. he knew this thing about animals and people, in a nutshell: “At his best, man is the noblest of all animals; separated from law and justice he is the worst.” I half agree with him, too. As far as zoology goes, Aristotle’s observations were vital to the creation of a taxonomic system; he was also the first to determine that whales and dolphins were marine mammals (not fish), and to describe and record migration. 5 and 59D: I lived my whole life saying EPSOM SALTS, so my first reaction to this was “one salt?” Then I realized that I was an unobservant lout (I have “Epsom Salt” in the house right now). Then I got curious about the Epsom part; of course, Epsom salt(s) come(s) from 17th-century Epsom, England, where mineral springs were discovered to have salubrious and purgative effects when taken internally. I’m now reminded of how good magnesium sulfate is for plants, if anyone gardens. 11D: Heathen alert — I was sure “Ishmael’s people” would be “whalers,” but they’re ARABS; in the Bible, Ishmael’s 12 sons founded the nomadic Arab nations. Of course there are a lot of twists, turns and wandering through the desert in the biblical allegory, as opposed to its aquatic counterpart, “Moby Dick.” 12D: Did I mention that I flailed away in this corner? Oxford is in OxfordSHIRE county; Cambridge is in CambridgeSHIRE county. There are only 48 “ceremonial” (or geographical) counties in all of England, and just over half of them are SHIREs. So many of you probably knew this one instantly, but I am stubbornly including it as tricky. The journey is the reward. But if you’re over living in the moment for now, here is this puzzle’s solution. While the answers are free to everyone, the Crossword puzzles require a subscription.

2018,Epitome of Completeness,"Wordplay SATURDAY PUZZLE — Roland Huget is back, with another beautifully constructed, “super symmetrical” puzzle — so called because it’s symmetrical about the horizontal, vertical and diagonal axes. In other words, you can turn this grid on all four sides and see the same configuration. Accomplishing this involved four 15-letter entries — two across and two down — no mean feat for Mr. Huget, but really mean for us solvers. To me there was an air of the classic forbidding Saturday puzzle to this one. With a couple of notably lowbrow exceptions (looking at you, IOU), the tone of the clues and the quality of the entries was less trendy than we’ve seen of late, the cultural references (VERE, SOREN, LE CID) a bit more academic, and the jokes a bit upper crustier. 8A: It struck me, while figuring this clue out, how obsolete the cassette recorder is. Could tapes ever have the cachet of vinyl, unless you have an affection for pops and hisses? I’m old enough to remember people who hoarded audiotapes of Grateful Dead shows (and usually asked me to help them move, with giant stacks of these plastic boxes reverently mummified in duct tape). Anyhow, I’d seen the word CAPSTAN before, as a nautical term, which is how it’d previously been clued. It’s a leveraged reel, basically, used on a ship for raising anchor, or on a cassette deck for hitching along your little magnetic strip so you can rock it with a boombox. 17A: When you’ve handled every last detail, you’ve crossed all your T’s and DOTTED every I. 28A: I believe I’ve been conflating “sheared” and SHEERED my whole life. You shear a sheep: T his involves a lot of wrestling while wielding a clipping shear that runs down the body, shaving the hair as close as possible to the skin. If you’ve ever tried this or watched it, there’s something of a visual metaphor there for a ship’s wake, or a harvester cutting through a field of wheat, in that this smooth path forms and the shears work in quick strokes that are sort of akin to quick changes of course elsewhere, such as at sea. I tend to think of “sheer” in terms of transparency, or the steepness of a cliff, but it also applies to certain maneuvers like those of a ship. 35A: Since both long across entries involved pop culture, I figured I’d explicate one of them. k.d. lang and Radiohead are contemporaries — Radiohead’s first U.S. single, “Creep,” also dates to 1992 — and I can’t get 31A out of my head at this point so I figured I wouldn’t inflict that on you. But Radiohead, a band that is still around and labeled by some a 21st-century Beatles, is also commonly labeled ALTERNATIVE ROCK. It’s a bit odd; usually college bands and less popular “sleeper” acts fit this category, and Radiohead sells out huge stadiums. But it’s definitely not your typical Top-40 band. Now I’ve got 31A plus this track duking it out between my ears. 1D: The role here refers to helicopters making emergency medical rescues, or MEDEVAC. This could trip up anyone who didn’t know that the first month on the Spanish calendar is spelled ENERO, since the spelling here seems interchangeable between the correct answer and “medivac.” 12D: As a lifelong fan of both trattorias and desserts, I was fairly confident in “tartufo” being the answer here, but eventually narrowed letters down to TORTONI. Somewhere deep in the recesses of my mind a bell rang, but it wasn’t to summon a delicious dessert cart. The name tortoni is derived from a 19th-century ice cream parlor in Paris, owned by a Neapolitan emigrant of the same name, that was the setting for one of the famous paintings stolen from the Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990, a Manet named “Chez Tortoni.” Of course, we have an 1898 recipe for tortoni. It looks nice, but less zaftig than the gooey sweets we’ve evolved to crave. 21D: I could not wrap my head around the idea that DIETETICS is a real word, despite knowing dietitians, or at least nutritionists, who it turns out are not the same thing. I think L. Ron Hubbard and dianetics ruined this word, among other things. 35D: Here’s an example of a clue — “Where drones return” — that bucks the trendy trend, forgive me for writing that. Nowadays, when I see the word drone I think of a children’s toy, more or less; you see them advertised in kid’s commercials, and in real life at the park or in someone’s backyard. I conveniently forget the military drone that goes on its mission and returns to its AIRBASE. 41D: Speaking of dietetics, right? I went right to delicious Mideast dishes like falafel and shakshuka. Instead the “diet” here is defined as assembly or government body — in this case, the legislative body of Israel, the KNESSET. Although it’s not too much of a stretch to see how the word diet could apply to both of these ideas — one to order eating, one to order society — it’s not really a sure thing that the two meanings have the same origin. 51D: This “Man’s nickname in a metropolitan orchestra?” turns out to be PHIL, which stands for philharmonic, if that made no sense to you. The metropolitan part made no sense to me, but I’d never really thought about orchestra vs. symphony vs. philharmonic. It seems that, in practical terms, the need for a philharmonic arises when there are two or more local orchestras confusing people, and that tends to happen only in urban settings. Although I’m sure there’s some remote island in the North Sea, perhaps, packed with high-caliber classical musicians, to prove me wrong. The original version of this grid was constructed in September 2016. A revision to the SE quadrant was requested, a revision was submitted, and the puzzle was accepted for publication in January 2017. The revision that was requested was the removal from the SE of the exclamation AM I BEAT, which was deemed too contrived. I myself have said this while plopping down on a chair — maybe it’s a Canadian thing. The block layout for this puzzle is one of my favorites. I’ve had success with versions in which there are two blocks in the middle breaking up the 15s, and in which there is a single block in dead center. This version has no central blocks. These puzzles are among my first attempts at wide open grids. As I look over the clues, 26A: PORE and 13D: ANDIRON make me chuckle, and I have Will and Joel/Sam to thank for that. I note that a fair number of changes were made to the clues I submitted, which have made the puzzle tougher, I think. Have you circled around and around this grid? Now you can take a peek at the answer key. While the answers are free to everyone, the Crossword puzzles require a subscription. What did you think?",The New York Times
2018,Equifax Picks Private Equity Executive as New C.E.O.,"Equifax on Wednesday named Mark Begor, a private equity executive who once led General Electric’s credit card business, as its new chief executive. Mr. Begor, 59, takes over for Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who has filled the role on an interim basis since September, when Richard F. Smith stepped down after a data breach exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 148 million people. Mr. Begor, a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, will start at Equifax on April 16. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO, a position he plans to give up before joining Equifax. Equifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million. Mr. Barros will stay through the transition and retire early next year, Equifax said. Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, is one of the country’s so-called big three credit reporting bureaus. It maintains files on about 220 million Americans. After the data breach — and a response by the company that was widely criticized as inadequate — Equifax has continued to stumble. In January, an app it released that was meant to let people lock their credit files was riddled with glitches. This month, a former company executive was charged with insider trading for selling Equifax shares after the breach but before it was publicly disclosed. “The team has made meaningful progress in the last several months to address a number of well-publicized issues,” Mr. Begor said in a statement. “I will prioritize continuing our team’s efforts to communicate transparently and restore confidence with consumers, customers, shareholders and policymakers.” Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate’s real-estate investment and energy management units.

2018,"Equitable Building, Spur for Modern Zoning, Will Get a $50 Million Face-Lift","Square Feet In 1915, when the office tower now known as the Equitable Building was completed at 120 Broadway in Lower Manhattan, it boasted all the latest conveniences — bad news for the owners of nearby office buildings, which were instantly rendered obsolete. It was also bad news for the tenants of those buildings because the tower’s swaggering size — it was the world’s largest office building at the time, covering an entire city block and shooting up 40 stories — cut off sunlight that had previously streamed into their offices. And it was bad news for passers-by on the streets and sidewalks, which were also cast in shadow. But it was an opportunity for critics who had long clamored for controls on untrammeled development and renewed their push for change. In 1916, New York’s first comprehensive zoning ordinance was passed, one that would inspire similar measures in municipalities across the country. Today, that former pariah is a beloved architectural treasure, designated both a city and a national landmark. Silverstein Properties, its owner, is embarking on a $50 million renovation that, among other things, will restore grandeur to the through-block corridor on the ground floor and re-establish it as a public thoroughfare. And in a twist, one of the building’s latest tenants is New York’s Department of City Planning — the keeper of the zoning code — which has just opened a new public hearing room in the very structure that helped bring about land-use controls 102 years ago. But the Equitable Building has always played a remarkable role in real estate. Ernest R. Graham designed the building, with an H-shaped superstructure atop a six-story base and a steel frame, clad in granite, terra cotta and brick. It was advanced in other ways, too. Four subway lines led directly into the building. Forty-eight passenger elevators provided speedy vertical transportation. According to Carol Willis, an architectural historian and the director of the Skyscraper Museum, the building pioneered the use of express elevators to sets of floors, promising 16,000 workers a wait of no more than 30 seconds. “It was all about efficiency,” she said. Other towers, including the nearby Woolworth Building, were taller. But the Equitable Building — a speculative structure whose floor area was 30 times the size of its lot — was far bulkier. And its shadows stretched seven blocks at their peak, prompting property owners in the vicinity to seek reductions in tax assessments because of the decline in the value of their holdings. The 1916 zoning resolution separated incompatible uses, like factories near homes. And it required that towers be set back as they grew taller, thus permitting more light to reach the street and giving rise to the “wedding cake” profile of many icons of the New York skyline. Zoning left its mark on New York, but it also shaped cities around the country. “It spread like wildfire,” said Eugenie Ladner Birch, Nussdorf professor and co-director of the Penn Institute for Urban Research at the University of Pennsylvania. The same year that New York enacted zoning, Chicago formed a zoning commission, and by 1923, it had its own comprehensive ordinance. New York endlessly tinkered with its zoning as the city grew. In 1961, a major overhaul encouraged towers in plazas, and in the decades since, more than a thousand pages of amendments have been added and numerous changes to the zoning maps have been made. The Equitable insurance company moved to Midtown Manhattan, and the building at 120 Broadway passed through the hands of a succession of big-name developers. When Silverstein Properties acquired it in 1981 for $60 million from a syndicate led by Harry Helmsley and Lawrence Wien, it also entered into a 999-year ground lease with the real estate companies that owned the land under it. The building was appealing because it offered a chance to gain control over an entire block in the financial district, said Larry Silverstein, chairman of the company that bears his name. The terms of the ground lease were particularly interesting, he said. The lease has no reappraisal provisions, meaning that his company still has 961 years left on a lease requiring annual payments of less than a million dollars, even as real estate values have soared. “It’s like owning land and never paying for it,” he said. When he purchased the building, Mr. Silverstein said, it was “a sad, old lady that needed a huge amount of time, attention and love.” A face-lift in the 1980s cleaned the facade and recreated eroded terra-cotta details. The work extended to the lobby, where the Tennessee pink-marble floor was repolished and the vaulted, coffered ceiling, decorated with plaster rosettes, was restored. For decades, the mahogany-paneled Bankers Club of America — where Queen Elizabeth II and Winston Churchill once dined — operated on the 39th floor. When Silverstein acquired the building, a luncheon club was still in operation, but as such enterprises dwindled, the company leased out the space for offices. Food and beverage service will return to the building with the capital improvements, which are scheduled to begin in May and are expected to take a year. The plans are being overseen by the architecture firm Beyer Blinder Belle, a building tenant. A cafe and espresso bar is likely to occupy the 40th floor, according to Silverstein. The renovation will also add a terrace on the roof, the amenity du jour in New York. Designed by another tenant, the landscape architecture firm MPFP, the terrace will be an elevated platform bordered by evergreen hedges and furnished with low-slung, all-weather seating. Those features will be for the exclusive use of tenants and their guests, but changes on the ground level will benefit the public at large. The wide, ground-floor corridor, which once allowed anyone and everyone to cut through the building, will become a public pass-through once again. The security desks that were installed after the Sept. 11 terror attacks will be removed. The public will also be able to stop at the shops lining the corridor, which are another part of the renovation. Tenants will proceed to the elevator banks for their floors; there, they will swipe smartphones equipped with a passcode or ID cards at turnstile sensors to gain entry. The bronze grillwork that once decorated all the elevators will be recreated. The dark green marble that now fills the arch above the Broadway entrance will be replaced with glass decorated with more grillwork, allowing sunlight to bathe the lobby once again. Working from grainy old black-and-white photos, the architects designed LED chandeliers for the lobby modeled on the originals. Rambusch, the New Jersey lighting firm that created fixtures for the Empire State Building, is making them. On a recent afternoon, after two samples were hoisted to the 31-foot ceiling, Mr. Silverstein arrived to give his stamp of approval. The developer said he planned to “hold on to this sweetheart” of a building, but makes no bones about his hopes to benefit financially from the improvements to 120 Broadway. According to a company representative, the 1.9 million-square-foot building is 93 percent leased, with asking rents in the high $50s per square foot. Macmillan Publishers recently signed a 20-year lease for five floors. The Department of City Planning, which moved in a couple of years ago, is still working through a punch list for its new public hearing room in the concourse below the lobby that leads to the subways. Marisa Lago, the agency’s director and chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, recently opened the first review session in the space. She checked off the ways the space improves on the previous location: more than three times the seating capacity, monitors spread throughout the audience area and an agenda-tracking display in the outer waiting area so that presenters know when to hustle in. The agency, Ms. Lago said, will soon start live-streaming its proceedings. “I think it’s particularly appropriate,” she added, “that we are now hearing the people’s land-use business inside the building that spawned the 1916 zoning resolution.”",The New York Times
2018,Erasmus vs. Luther — a Rift That Defined the Course of Western Civilization,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. FATAL DISCORD Erasmus, Luther and the Fight for the Western Mind By Michael Massing Illustrated. 976 pp. Harper. $45. Often the best way to understand opposing viewpoints is to imagine the proponents in dialogue. How would Euripides have responded to Plato, his Athenian contemporary, concerning the philosopher’s banishing poets from his utopia? Or picture George Eliot cornering Arthur Schopenhauer to challenge his argument that women are unsuited for artistic and intellectual greatness. The history of ideas is filled with pairs of contemporary minds who missed the opportunity to confront each other point blank, leaving us to dream up hypothetical exchanges. But sometimes our imaginations aren’t necessary. Desiderius Erasmus and Martin Luther, though they never met in person, were articulate in their assessments of each other. In their disdain for the power-hungry abuses of the church, the grotesque superstitions it encouraged in the laity and the equally grotesque scholasticism it encouraged in the era’s theologians, they might have been natural allies; instead they became implacable foes. Each, in opposing the other, clarified his own point of view. In the process, the two great reformist movements of their day — the Renaissance, embodied in Erasmus, and the Reformation, embodied in Luther — were torn asunder. Michael Massing’s riveting “Fatal Discord: Erasmus, Luther and the Fight for the Western Mind” is devoted to this fateful parting of ways. Last year, which saw the 500th anniversary of Luther’s posting of his 95 Theses attacking the church for its profit-making excesses, produced a stack of books to mark the occasion. But as far as I know, “Fatal Discord” is alone in addressing Luther by way of his relationship with Erasmus. It’s an inspired approach, and Massing, a journalist, has produced a sprawling narrative around the rift between the two men, laying out the sociological, political and economic factors that shaped both them and Europe’s responses to them, and tracing their theological disputes back to the earliest days of Christianity. Though a massive amount of material is marshaled, Massing’s journalistic skills keep the story line crisply coherent. Massing’s book begins with chapters alternating equitably between the two men. However, Luther — obdurate and reckless, bilious and doctrinaire — eventually swamps the book, as he eventually swamped the urbane and ironic man of letters. The Christianity that Erasmus advocated — eschewing the finer points of metaphysics in favor of the humility, simplicity and charity he saw in Jesus of Nazareth — was overpowered by Luther’s conviction that the Word of God, revealed in Scripture, speaks unambiguously on all doctrinal matters, no matter how abstruse. For Luther, who as a young monk had suffered from Anfechtungen (his word for the terror and despair at the thought that God would momentarily be judging him and find him failing), only apodictic certitude would do. Both men displayed a fierce determination in the way they overcame their inauspicious beginnings. Erasmus was the illegitimate son of a physician’s daughter and a priest; he rued the unlawfulness of the union all his life. He named himself Desiderius, meaning longed for. More apt would have been Desiderans, for longing. Both parents died early, and he was coerced by his guardian into a monastery and later into taking the vows of priesthood. He found monastic life suffocating, longing for the spirit of the Renaissance that had taken hold in Italy, inspired by the newly awakened passion for classical wisdom. Like Petrarch, Erasmus searched out the pagan manuscripts disintegrating in monasteries, laboriously taught himself ancient Greek and cultivated a stylistically dazzling Latin. Such achievements counted, for him, as moral achievements, almost on a par with the Christian virtues. He was a firm believer in human perfectibility, which is one of the convictions that would put him on a collision course with Luther, committed to the incorrigible depravity of human nature. Erasmus’s humanist scholarship and reformist Christianity converged in his “Novum Instrumentum,” the first Greek New Testament ever to be published. His motivation was to better Christianity by correcting corruptions of the original Greek that had insinuated themselves into the Latin Vulgate. While the orthodox condemned him, the implication that errors were embedded in church tenets made him a hero to some, including an obscure young man seeking certitude in a monastery in Wittenberg. Where Erasmus had found it necessary to flee from monastic life, Luther fled to it, against his father’s wishes. But even within the monastery, his Anfechtungen continued. How could one know that all one’s pious efforts would be judged adequate in the eyes of God? He eventually found his answer, gleaned from his reading of Paul’s Epistle to the Romans: We need not worry about failing, since nothing we do makes any difference. Our fate is predestined by God, and our salvation will come through faith in that conviction. Luther’s famous principle of “justification by faith,” making (some of) us passive recipients of God’s unearned love, would become central in the movement that would eventually be known as Protestantism. For Luther, nothing he didn’t personally hear reverberating within the words of Scripture could be sanctioned, including the vast hierarchy of the church and its self-serving dictums. Erasmus’s declaration (in his “Enchiridion”) that “monasticism is not piety” resonated with him. He also used Erasmus’s New Testament (the second of the five editions it would undergo) for his own translation of Scripture into German, so that the people themselves might take their religion directly from that one true source. “All Christians are priests,” Luther provocatively wrote. Into that narrow space of questioning the church’s authority that Erasmus had pried apart, Luther stepped, and blasted it wide open. Erasmus was horrified — horrified at the violence of Luther’s certitude, horrified at the violence his certitude bred within Christendom. Erasmus was among the earliest of pacifists, calling Mars “the stupidest of all the gods,” so there is a tragic irony in his having contributed, no matter how indirectly, to the bloody sectarian turmoil that erupted from Christianity’s splintering. In his divergence from Luther, Erasmus is often viewed as the one at a disadvantage. Whereas Luther displayed the courage of his convictions, Erasmus comes off as a self-protective pragmatist, seeking accommodation with the church so as to pursue his life with a minimum of upset. Little suggests otherwise in “Fatal Discord,” and that is regrettable. In the dialogue between Luther and Erasmus, Massing has omitted Erasmus’s strongest lines, which are epistemological in nature. Erasmus doubts Luther’s absolute rule of faith more than he doubts the institution of the church, whose flaws — he hoped — could be corrected. He is justifiably skeptical of a self-verifying criterion for truth that can generate the kind of knowledge Luther claimed for himself. This principled skepticism is the epistemological backbone that stiffened his anti-Lutheran stance. Massing writes that Erasmus’s influences on us today, unlike Luther’s, are faint. I disagree. Modern philosophy was born in the century after Erasmus and Luther. It emerged, not coincidentally, in the wake of the ensanguined doctrinal disputes that killed off Europeans at a higher percentage of their population than did World War I. Modern philosophy would be marked by its refocus on epistemology, which scrupulously analyzes the conditions for knowledge, as opposed to mere belief, and which recognizes, in the spirit of Erasmus, that among the threats to human flourishing, we should not underestimate the dangers of misplaced certitude.",The New York Times
2018,Erdogan’s Next Target as He Restricts Turkey’s Democracy: The Internet,"ISTANBUL — Having already brought Turkey’s mainstream media to heel, and made considerable headway in rolling back Turkish democracy, the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has set its sights on a seemingly innocuous target: a satellite television preacher named Adnan Oktar. For seven years, with an unholy blend of the racy and the religious, Mr. Oktar has presented his show daily via satellite, cable and the internet, where he expounds on Islamic creationism, peace and love, often to a studio audience of women in miniskirts and plunging necklines. Religious conservatives in the government now say they want to shut him down. But critics say that Mr. Oktar has become a convenient trigger for the government to pursue wide-reaching restrictions on internet content and broadcasters. The real aim, they say, besides enforcing moral standards on the likes of Mr. Oktar, is to close off a final refuge for the news media and the political opposition as the government widens an already formidable crackdown on dissent. Just three days after the government announced its campaign against Mr. Oktar, it introduced an expansive set of new internet restrictions that would affect millions of Turks who use the internet and social media. “With Master Adnan as an excuse, extensive censorship coming for internet media,” one news website headline warned. The draft law has passed the parliamentary commission stage, and may go to a vote next week, legislators say. Even before it is passed, outside authorities are raising alarms. Harlem Désir, representative on freedom of the media at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, urged legislators to revise the bill, saying it restricted pluralism online and could be incompatible with international conventions. But a creeping control of the media has been a persistent feature of Mr. Erdogan’s 15 years in power. He has used every legal means, as well as extraordinary emergency powers since a failed coup in 2016, to steadily turn Turkey into an authoritarian system under his thumb. As Mr. Erdogan plans to run in an election for a presidency with newly enhanced powers, which may come this year, the new media law would put yet another heavy finger on the scale in his favor. It would allow him to mute whatever opposition voices have not already been silenced. “It is just about control,” said Kerem Altiparmak, a human rights and media lawyer. “Considering what has been happening in Turkey, I have no doubt this is a hegemonic power, controlling newspapers, TV and the judiciary, that is now out to control the internet sector.” The irony is that Mr. Erdogan is responsible for the economic progress that has made Turkey a largely middle-class country and allowed many to be educated and able to afford cellphones and the internet. A former businessman and mayor of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan began his transformation of Turkey by building on the early, enormous popularity he gained with social programs that offered health care and pensions to all, and infrastructure projects that eased housing and transportation strains. Initially, he oversaw democratic reforms as part of Turkey’s bid for European Union membership. But as Mr. Erdogan notched up electoral successes, he not only undermined his opponents but he also turned on various allies who had helped him rise to power. His first target was Turkey’s once powerful military, which he emasculated with a series of arrests and high-profile trials that was completed in 2013. Later, he turned against former allies within the Islamist movement, followers of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States. They had led the campaign to dismantle the military and were demanding a greater share of power. In 2013, Mr. Erdogan closed down the network of university-preparatory schools run by Mr. Gulen, cutting into a major source of finance and influence for his movement. When supporters of Mr. Gulen attempted a coup in the summer of 2016, Mr. Erdogan answered with his nationwide crackdown, which is drawing increasing rebuke in Europe. So far, Mr. Erdogan has detained more than 60,000 people accused of being Gulen followers and purged or suspended 150,000 government employees. He also used the opportunity to round up academics, journalists and political opponents. The purges hastened the trend under Mr. Erdogan’s leadership of placing loyalists in government and public institutions. The police, judiciary and even universities have by now been transformed. In fact, virtually all the levers of power now belong to Mr. Erdogan, including much of the news media. The government tamed the largest and most powerful media companies by imposing huge tax fines on them and forcing them to sell off assets, and pushing loyal businessmen to take over publications and television channels. After the 2016 coup, 150 media outlets were closed down, and journalists were imprisoned at a pace that left Turkey second only to China, a much larger country, for the numbers jailed. In 2002, when Mr. Erdogan became prime minister, pro-government businesses owned fewer than a quarter of Turkish media outlets, according to “The New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey,” by Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish research program at The Washington Institute. By 2011, they owned about 50 percent, and by 2017 most of the mainstream media outlets were in their hands. Censors control content in government media offices, and private media outlets are issued strict guidelines. “Erdogan can successfully edit out reality,” Mr. Cagaptay said in an interview. The co-opting of the mainstream media has helped push Turks, especially the young and middle class, to the internet, which is delivering popular alternatives to a growing audience. Besides a growing number of entertainment providers, including Netflix, and the Turkish equivalents Puhu TV and BluTV, there are several lively independent internet news outlets that publish through social media platforms and podcasts. All of them could be targeted under an article slipped into the innocuous-sounding bill under consideration — “Tax Law and the Law to Change Some Laws and Decrees.” As drafted it would force any outlets broadcasting via the internet to be licensed. It would also give the watchdog Radio and Television Supreme Council powers to halt live-streaming and fine companies over content. Ahmet Arslan, minister for transportation and communication, who denies there is censorship in Turkey, defended the bill before journalists at an event celebrating Secure Internet Day. “We have to take measures about radio and television broadcasts if there is a wrongdoing about national security, and ethical values of the country,” Mr. Arslan said. “Our aim is to bring a legal regulation, and prevent mistakes,” he added. “It is certainly not to intervene against any correct broadcasting, any work that is done in harmony with our values.” The government already imposes restrictions on television shows, making channels edit out curses and blur cigarettes and alcohol. Shows viewed via the internet have so far escaped such controls. “If there is any wrongdoing, there should of course be an intervention,” Mr. Arslan concluded. “This is the aim of the regulation.” But Mr. Altiparmak, who is also a lecturer in law at the University of Ankara, said that while it was necessary to license television channels, because television frequencies were limited, the internet was limitless and so licensing was not necessary in the same way. Instead, the bill would merely allow the government to block any outlet it dislikes by refusing a license without having to prove grounds of national security or ethics. “The first thing is a judge will be able to block a website without having to show a reason,” he said. “Second they can bring sanctions against TV stations and fines on internet TV.” The Turkish telecommunications regulatory authority, BTK, already regulates internet providers, removing content and blocking websites that it disapproves of. Wikipedia has been blocked for months, pro-Kurdish news sites are frequently closed down, and a leftist website Sendika.org has renamed itself 62 times to get around government blocks. Indeed, the scale of the government crackdown has instilled such fear and suspicion in Turkey that many intellectuals and journalists have fled the country. In the first weeks of 2018, as Turkey began a military operation against Kurdish militants in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin, the police detained more than 600 people for opposing the intervention on social media or for taking part in protests. Garo Paylan, a member of Parliament for the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party and a member of the commission studying the bill, warned that the government intended to curb the internet the same way it had constrained television and newspapers. “Any kind of broadcast over social media can be included, which means millions of people won’t be able to broadcast,” he said in a telephone interview. “Only supporters will be able to get a license,” he added. “And it would cost an amount. Many people would hold back from applying.” The government could take action against anyone broadcasting without a license, although Hamit Ersoy, a member of Radio and Television Supreme Council, said the bill was aimed at online on-demand broadcasting and not social media, in comments to the Anadolu news agency. Mr. Paylan’s predominantly Kurdish party has especially suffered. Nine lawmakers are in jail, including the leader of the party, who was accused of terrorism. The party is effectively banned from all mainstream media. Its legislators now broadcast parliamentary news to their followers via Facebook’s Periscope. Now those broadcasts could be stopped as well, Mr. Paylan said. “If enacted, we will see the same situation for internet that the press and television fell into,” he said. “And this will detach us from the rest of the world more.”",The New York Times
2018,Eric Holder Says He’ll Sue to Block Citizenship Question on Census,"Eric H. Holder Jr., the United States attorney general for six years under President Barack Obama, stepped away from public service in 2015 but has since emerged as a bulwark against the Trump administration, taking a leading role in challenging the president’s policies in court and trying to chip away at the Republicans’ grip on state governments. Mr. Holder discussed his efforts to fight Republican gerrymandering, whether Facebook should be regulated and the potential legacy of Mr. Trump’s presidency in a wide-ranging TimesTalks conversation with the reporter Alexander Burns on Wednesday night in New York. Here are the takeaways. After the Trump administration announced this week that it would add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, Mr. Holder said he planned to sue to block the change on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which he chairs. The census aims to count everyone who resides in the country, whether they are citizens or not, and Mr. Holder echoed the concerns expressed by several states this week that the citizenship question could reduce the responses from noncitizens and even legal immigrants. He said his lawsuit would be aided by Mr. Trump’s Twitter utterances. “This is one of those incidences where I think the president’s tweets and public statements will become relevant,” Mr. Holder, 67, said. “To show the true intent — that it is not as benign as they would make it out to be. Through the words of Donald Trump and through the tweets of Donald Trump, you’ll see what the true intention was of the administration.” Normally, he noted, it would be difficult to argue in court that the government pushed a policy with a malicious intent. But Mr. Trump’s tweets provide plenty of material for lawsuits, Mr. Holder said. “It is certainly the gift that keeps on giving,” he said. Mr. Holder conceded that he prefers Twitter to Facebook but occasionally catches a glimpse of Facebook when his wife signs on. But he said he had been following the recent news that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. That security breach, along with the social network’s role in spreading Russian-backed propaganda during the presidential election, bolstered an argument for regulating Facebook, Mr. Holder said. “There needs to be a certain degree of freedom,” he said. “We don’t want to stifle the creativity that comes from those platforms.” But he added: “There is a way in which we have to think of these platforms as communication companies. What then does that mean in terms of how they should be regulated?” Mr. Holder, who served as the attorney general from February 2009 to April 2015, said he was stunned by the support Mr. Trump still enjoyed in some circles after a pornographic-film star and a former Playboy model claimed they had sexual relationships with him. “I find it hard to believe the conversations that we have about the conduct of this president. They are mind-blowing,” he said. “I think to myself, You gave my guy grief because he wore a tan suit.” Mr. Holder said that if the same allegations of extramarital affairs had been made against Mr. Obama or President George W. Bush, their presidencies would have been over. “I just don’t understand how this has not had the reaction generated that would have been generated by any other president,” he said. Mr. Trump has nominated Mike Pompeo, the director of the C.I.A., to be the next secretary of state and named a veteran of the spy agency, Gina Haspel, as the next director. Both nominations require Senate confirmation, and Ms. Haspel will certainly face questions about her work as a clandestine officer in the agency’s counterterrorism operations. She oversaw a secret prison in Thailand involved in the rendition, detention and interrogation of detainees. In 2012, Mr. Holder effectively closed that dark chapter in the C.I.A.’s history, announcing that a three-year Justice Department investigation into brutal interrogations was ending without a prosecution. The decision outraged some liberals. On Wednesday night, Mr. Holder said that Ms. Haspel would have to answer tough questions — and that the public deserved to know more about the country’s enhanced interrogation program. He said that parts of the Justice Department report and a separate Senate investigation into the program should be declassified. “The American people need to know exactly what happened during that time period,” he said. Responding to recent calls for a repeal of the Second Amendment, Mr. Holder said such an effort was impracticable but offered four suggestions to address what he called a “gun violence epidemic in the United States.” His remarks came days after John Paul Stevens, a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, wrote an Op-Ed in The Times advocating repeal. Assault weapons should be banned, as well as higher-capacity magazines, Mr. Holder said. Background checks should be expanded for prospective gun buyers, and the government should reinstate the funding of studies on gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Compare us to any other nation, and we are just off the charts when it comes to mass shootings and the number of people killed through the use of firearms,” Mr. Holder said. “We have to do something about it.”",The New York Times

2018,"Escalating Trade Fight, Trump Threatens Higher Taxes on European Cars","WASHINGTON — President Trump warned on Saturday that he would apply higher taxes on imported European cars if the European Union carried through on its threat to retaliate against his proposed stiff new tariffs on steel and aluminum. “If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S.,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter from Florida, where he was spending part of the weekend. “They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!” It was the latest indication that Mr. Trump, despite pressure from foreign allies and American business leaders, is standing by his decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from all countries. The action is likely to be signed this coming week. After Mr. Trump announced the penalties on Thursday, European Union leaders warned that American goods like Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, many of them with roots in the home states of key Republican leaders, would be treated “the same way” if the steel and aluminum tariffs were enforced. Officials from Australia, Canada and other American trade partners also made retaliatory threats. Mr. Trump has long seized on what he perceives as the unfair barriers that American automakers face in exporting their cars, noting that many Mercedes-Benzes can be seen on the streets of New York but few Chevrolets on the streets of European cities. The European Union levies a 10 percent duty on cars made in the United States, and the United States levies a 2.5 percent duty on cars produced in Europe. While the president threatened unilateral action, his ability to change the tariff, which was decided in complex international negotiations, might be limited without taking the major step of pulling out of the World Trade Organization. The auto industry is a complex target for the president — European automakers have plants in the United States and employ thousands of Americans, and United States automakers do sell large numbers of cars in Europe under brands unfamiliar to Americans. In addition, among some Europeans, American cars are seen as less desirable than those from Europe or Japan. The Trump administration has been fighting for more trade concessions from its global trade partners, with negotiators in Mexico City hashing out changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement and officials working on modifications to a trade deal with South Korea. Mexico is also looking at its options to retaliate if the Trump administration goes ahead with the tariffs, said a Mexican source close to the Nafta talks, which are taking place in Mexico City through Monday. In 2009, Mexico imposed targeted tariffs to retaliate against Washington’s violation of a Nafta agreement on trucking. Some 90 products were included, from strawberries to sunglasses to Christmas trees, to affect as many states as possible. Many economists warn that if Mr. Trump’s actions lead to an international trade war, a global recession could follow. Republican lawmakers are worried that such a trade fight would undo the promised economic stimulus from the $1.5 trillion tax cut approved last year and the administration’s deregulation push. But Mr. Trump has continued to pursue the fulfillment of his “America First” campaign promise and his vows to protect struggling American steel makers, writing on Twitter on Friday that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” “The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our ‘very stupid’ trade deals and policies,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!” The president’s move contradicts the positions of many top economic advisers in the administration, including Gary D. Cohn, who has lobbied heavily against the tariffs and warned that he might resign if they are put into place. Jerome H. Powell, the new Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress on Thursday that “the tariff approach is not the best approach” for trade disputes.",The New York Times
2018,Escort Says Audio Recordings Show Russian Meddling in U.S. Election,"BANGKOK — A Belarusian escort with close ties to a powerful Russian oligarch said from behind bars in Bangkok on Monday that she had more than 16 hours of audio recordings that could help shed light on Russian meddling in United States elections. The escort, Anastasia Vashukevich, said she would hand over the recordings if the United States granted her asylum. She faces criminal charges and deportation to Belarus after coming under suspicion of working in Thailand without a visa at a sex-training seminar in the city of Pattaya. Ms. Vashukevich, who described herself as close to the Russian aluminum tycoon Oleg V. Deripaska, said that audio recordings she made in August 2016 included discussions he had about the United States presidential election with people she declined to identify. Mr. Deripaska, a billionaire with close ties to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, also has business ties to Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman. Mr. Manafort is under investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into the campaign’s connections to Russia. “If America gives me protection, I will tell everything I know,” Ms. Vashukevich said on Monday. “I am afraid to go back to Russia. Some strange things can happen.” Her assertion could be easy to disregard were it not for a 25-minute video investigation posted last month on YouTube by the Russian opposition figure Aleksei A. Navalny, which relies heavily on videos and photographs from Ms. Vashukevich. She and nine people from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were arrested late last month in Pattaya, a city about 70 miles south of Bangkok known for its adult entertainment scene. Most of those arrested, including Ms. Vashukevich, 21, who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka, are accused of working without a permit. Some are also accused of not having a valid Thai visa. Ms. Vashukevich and Alexander Kirillov, the organizer of the sex seminar, spoke to three reporters while standing behind bars and a mesh screen during visiting hours at the Immigration Detention Center in Bangkok. Immigration officials stopped the interviews midway and told the reporters to leave the facility. Ms. Vashukevich, wearing a bright green T-shirt with the word “detainee” in Thai, is a long way from the days she spent sailing on a yacht with Mr. Deripaska and his friends, including Sergei E. Prikhodko, a deputy prime minister. According to her version of events, she was working for a modeling agency when she and several other models were sent to spend time on Mr. Deripaska’s yacht. She later posted photographs and videos on social media showing Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Prikhodko together on the yacht. Financial records show that companies controlled by Mr. Manafort owed millions of dollars to Mr. Deripaska. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Manafort offered to give Mr. Deripaska private briefings on the campaign. Mr. Navalny charged in his video that Mr. Deripaska’s yacht trip was an attempt to bribe Mr. Prikhodko, and that Ms. Vashukevich was one of “several” prostitutes aboard the vessel. In the video, the tycoon and Mr. Prikhodko can be heard discussing Russian-American relations. The video also highlights a book Ms. Vashukevich wrote titled “Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire.” Russia has tried to block Mr. Navalny’s video, which had nearly 6.4 million views on YouTube as of Monday. A spokesman for Mr. Deripaska has said the allegations of bribery and prostitutes on the yacht were a “hot story that appears far from being the truth.” In the interview at the immigration center on Monday, Ms. Vashukevich said that she had often recorded conversations between Mr. Deripaska and his associates, and that she had 16 to 18 hours of recordings, including conversations about the United States presidential election. “They were discussing elections,” she said. “Deripaska had a plan about elections.” But, she added, “I can’t tell you everything.” Some of the conversations were with three people who spoke English fluently and who she thought were Americans, she said. “It is not only about me,” she said. “It concerns a lot of people in America and other countries.” Ms. Vashukevich and Mr. Kirillov, who also goes by the name Alex Lesley, are prominent on social media and are considered by some to be publicity seekers. Ms. Vashukevich took part in a small protest in Moscow last year defending Harvey Weinstein after he faced numerous accusations of sexual abuse. Standing mostly naked near the American Embassy, she and four other women held signs with slogans such as “Hands Off Harvey” and “Harvey Weinstein Welcome to Russia.” Ms. Vashukevich said she arrived in Thailand on Feb. 16, and that she was only an observer at the sex seminar but did not work at the event. Several attendees said that no sex had been involved, and that the multiday training had focused on improving communication and on perfecting the art of seduction. Those who are taken to the immigration detention center are often on the verge of being deported. But an immigration official said that Ms. Vashukevich and five others taken to the center still faced criminal charges for their part in the seminar. They will be sent back to Pattaya for court proceedings. Ms. Vashukevich described being held in a crowded cell with more than 100 women and only three toilets. She said a Thai official had asked her to sign a paper saying that she believed she would be safe in Russia, but that she had refused. In general, people seeking asylum must apply in the country where they hope to take refuge. A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Bangkok said she was aware of the arrests but declined to discuss the case or any asylum request. Mr. Kirillov said that he believed publicity would help protect them. “I think the press makes us a little bit safer because if they killed us in the prison, everyone would know,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"Et Tu, Rafael? Cruz Asks Democratic Rival, Beto O’Rourke, ‘What’s in a Nickname?’","WASHINGTON — The day after the Texas primary, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, jumped into his general re-election campaign on Wednesday with a quick strike trying to paint his Democratic opponent, Representative Beto O’Rourke, as a Latino-come-lately. But Mr. O’Rourke, whose family has lived on the Mexican border in El Paso for four generations, hit back with a secret weapon — a picture of him as a preschooler with the name “Beto” stitched onto his sweater. At issue is that most intangible of political assets, authenticity, or perhaps a Shakespearean question, “What’s in a name?” Mr. Cruz, taking a page from President Trump’s playbook of stamping damaging labels on his opponents, seemed to be trying to undermine the authenticity of Mr. O’Rourke, whose birth name is Robert Francis, but who has been known since childhood as “Beto.” A quick radio and online jingle, released on Wednesday, drawled, “Liberal Robert wanted to fit in, so he changed his name to Beto and hid it with a grin.” It is the kind of skewer that worked for Mr. Trump, including against the Texas senator, whom he called “Lyin’ Ted.” With a quick photo response that leaned more cute than cutting, Mr. O’Rourke may be able to defuse any lasting effect of Mr. Cruz’s approach. Mr. O’Rourke owned up that he tried to go by Robert as a student at Columbia University, but when his friends found out that he was known as Beto, that name stuck. “I am really happy with whatever anyone calls me,” Mr. O’Rourke said in an interview. He said Texas voters were far more interested in discussing jobs, health care and immigration. “They want us to take on these really urgent priorities,” he said, “not just this smallness and pettiness that dominates the national conversation today.” But as Mr. Trump showed, derisive nicknames can plant doubt, as it did in the case of “Crooked” Hillary Clinton, and “Little Marco” Rubio during the campaign, and with “Low Energy” Jeb Bush, “Liddle Bob Corker” and “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer,” among others, as president. Of course Mr. Cruz comes to this game with his own label liability: He was born Rafael Edward Cruz, but goes by “Ted.” “Cruz lacks Trump’s visceral instincts,” said Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist. “Plus, I suspect voters are getting tired of Trump’s schtick from Trump; they’re unlikely to want a pale imitation.” So if Mr. O’Rourke is going for a Latin sound to appeal to one segment of Texas voters, Mr. Cruz could be accused of veering Anglo-Saxon to appeal to another. That Mr. Cruz would move so quickly to try to skewer his opponent is a measure of how seriously he is taking the challenge from Mr. O’Rourke, even though no Democrat has won a statewide office since 1994. “If you’re gonna run in Texas, you can’t run as a liberal man,” his jingle intoned. Mr. Cruz told “New Day” on CNN: “In terms of the jingle, some of it is just having a sense of humor. We had some fun with it.” As for his own use of Ted rather than Rafael, Mr. Cruz said, “You’re absolutely right. My name is Rafael Edward Cruz. I am the son of my father Rafael Cruz, an immigrant from Cuba who came to Texas with nothing.” Mr. O’Rourke has been raising more money than Mr. Cruz in recent quarters and has tried to awaken a dormant Democratic vote in rural parts of Texas by relentlessly holding town hall-style meetings. But Mr. Cruz, known as a skilled tactician and debater, is still the clear favorite in the race.",The New York Times
2018,Ethan Hawke and Paul Dano to Star in ‘True West’ on Broadway,"Ethan Hawke and Paul Dano will star as mismatched brothers in a coming Broadway production of Sam Shepard’s “True West” directed by James Macdonald, Roundabout Theater Company announced Tuesday. The play is slated to open on Jan. 24, 2019, at the American Airlines Theater; previews are to begin on Dec. 27. Mr. Hawke will play Lee, a troubled thief, and Mr. Dano will play Austin, Lee’s younger sibling and a screenwriter. After having not seen each other for several years, they are thrown together when Austin house-sits for their mother at her home near Los Angeles, where the brothers hash out their rivalry. “I have wanted to do Sam Shepard’s ‘True West’ for some time with James on board to direct,” Todd Haimes, artistic director and chief executive of Roundabout Theater Company, said by email. “It’s taken us several years to find the two ferocious, magnificent stage actors that this play demands,” he continued. “We finally got them in Ethan and Paul.” The play will serve as a reunion of sorts for Mr. Hawke and Mr. Dano. The two acted together in the film “Taking Lives” (2004) and Mr. Hawke directed Mr. Dano in an Off Broadway production of “Things We Want” (2007). “True West” will be Mr. Dano’s return to Roundabout. He made his Broadway debut in the company’s 1995 revival of “A Month in the Country” at the age of 10. Mr. Hawke also has a history with Mr. Shepard and his work. In 1995 he appeared in Mr. Shepard’s “Buried Child” at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago. More recently, in 2010, Mr. Hawke directed an Off Broadway production of Mr. Shepard’s “A Lie of the Mind.” After Mr. Shepard’s death in 2017, he told Entertainment Weekly: “For my generation, there’s a bit of hero worship that went along with Sam. He was someone who could act and direct and write at such a high level. He’s a poet of the first order. I first saw a production of ‘True West’ when I was 14. That production did for my generation what Brando and ‘Streetcar’ had done for a generation earlier.” “True West” was last performed on Broadway in 2000, with Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly taking turns playing the leading roles.",The New York Times
2018,"Ethel Stein, Who Created Intricate Textile Art, Dies at 100","Ethel Stein, a weaver who created countless intricate textile artworks and one particularly influential sock puppet, died on Friday in Cortlandt, N.Y. She was 100. Her son, Carl, said the cause was complications of pneumonia. Working largely out of the artistic limelight at her home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Ms. Stein resurrected historical weaving techniques and merged them with 20th-century Bauhaus design sensibilities. “The result was something new and profound,” Daniel Walker, former chairman of the department of textiles at the Art Institute of Chicago, said by email, “seemingly simple patterns based on geometry and shading, whose apparent simplicity had been made possible only because of the technical complexity of the weaving. Stein’s artistic legacy is thus a unique one.” A more lighthearted part of her legacy came from a side business that grew out of her penchant for repurposing things that others might have discarded. She turned old socks into puppets, first for her son’s nursery school, then for a growing body of fans. She began selling them at a booth in a department store in Manhattan; a monograph published by her representative, Browngrotta Arts, says she sold 10,000. One wound up in, or on, the hands of a young puppeteer named Shari Lewis, who by 1953 was making a name for herself in children’s television in the New York market. Ms. Stein, the monograph says, designed several puppets for Ms. Lewis, who would later in the 1950s achieve national fame with Lamb Chop, Charlie Horse and the rest of her puppet pals. Ethel Levy was born on June 22, 1917, in New York City to Tanya Levy. Carl Stein said his mother never spoke of her father. She was reared by an aunt and uncle, Ella and Abbo Ostrowsky, and spent several years at the progressive Hessian Hills School in Croton-on-Hudson, where the teachers included the painter George Biddle and the sculptor Wharton Esherick. She did not attend college, but by the latter half of the 1930s she was working as an assistant at the Educational Alliance Art School in Manhattan, where Mr. Ostrowsky was director. There she learned from the sculptor Chaim Gross, and after moving to Cambridge, Mass., in the late 1930s, she studied with Josef Albers and others associated with the Bauhaus movement. She also met her future husband, the architect Richard G. Stein, who was completing his master’s degree at Harvard. After his service in World War II, they settled in Croton-on-Hudson. Ms. Stein was a sculptor early in her career but became increasingly interested in textiles, and in the 1970s her woven work took on a new level of complexity after she met Milton Sonday, then the curator of textiles at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. She began studying the textiles in the museum’s collection, sometimes under a microscope, to see how they were made. “Perhaps more than any other significant textile artist of the 20th century, Ethel Stein’s work grew out of her study of historical textile techniques that she decoded to achieve an extraordinary freedom of expression in her own woven art works,” Lucy A. Commoner, former head of conservation and senior textile conservator at Cooper Hewitt, said by email. “Through years of research in world-renowned museum textile collections,” Ms. Commoner added, “she made permanent contributions to the academic study of textile structures while simultaneously informing her own work.” That work could be colorfully geometric, like her “Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Orange” series from 1995. It could be monochromatic, like “White Pinwheel,” a 1990 work that achieves a tunnel-like effect. It could be abstract or figurative, meticulously planned and diagramed or a product of experimentation and happy accident. Ms. Stein’s works were exhibited in group shows at institutions including Cooper Hewitt, the American Craft Museum in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as in England, the Netherlands and Switzerland. But she was not widely known outside the textile-art world. “Ethel Stein did not shun an audience; rather, she sidestepped the pervasive marketing focus of others,” Jack Lenor Larsen, a noted textile designer and author, wrote in the introduction to the monograph. “She would rather just get on to the next project.” Ms. Stein’s husband died in 1990. In addition to her son, she is survived by a granddaughter. In 2012, Ms. Stein donated 34 of her works to the Art Institute of Chicago, which in 2014 gave her, at 96, what Mr. Walker said was her first solo exhibition. A video made for that exhibition shows her not only working a formidable loom, but also making the mathematical calculations necessary to achieve the patterns she was after, hand-dyeing the threads and more. Mr. Walker put it simply. “She was,” he said, “a weaver’s weaver.”",The New York Times
2018,Ethiopia Seeks Calm With a New Leader,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopia’s governing coalition named a new leader late Tuesday night, paving the way for a peaceful transition of power in a country rocked in recent years by violent protests. Abiy Ahmed, who is expected to become the country’s next prime minister, would be the first member of the Oromo ethnic group, which makes up a third of Ethiopia’s population, to lead the government. The group, which has suffered political and economic repression, has been at the center of protests demanding more economic opportunities and greater freedom of expression. The country has been in a state of emergency since the former prime minister’s resignation in February. The choice of Mr. Abiy was widely seen as a move to maintain stability in Ethiopia, which has East Africa’s largest economy and is a critical player in the regional fight against terrorism. “The short term significance of this choice is that it will calm things down,” said Mekonnen Mengesha, a political analyst and professor at Wolkite University, which is about 100 miles outside of Addis Ababa, the capital. “But in the long run the main question is, is this move just shuffling leaders, or is it a systematic change from the administration?” Mr. Mekonnen said Mr. Abiy would face many challenges in unifying and leading the country. “It will be a struggle to change the status quo,” he said. “He is energetic and reformist, but that could also shake the government.” A movement for change began in 2015 with street protests in the Oromia region, which includes Addis Ababa, and spread to other regions unhappy with the dominant party’s grip on economic and political power. At least 700 people have died in the protests. Earlier this year, Ethiopia’s governing coalition had made concessions to popular demands for change, releasing hundreds of political prisoners, a move championed by Oromo activists. The resignation in February of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, was widely viewed as an acknowledgment that those concessions had not gone far enough — making it virtually inevitable, experts said, that the next prime minister would come from the Oromo group. Although the country is led by a coalition of four parties, the minority Tigrayan party has long been seen as controlling the political and economic life of Ethiopia. Mr. Abiy, 41, was named the leader of the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization, one of the four parties in the coalition just last month. Young and charismatic, he delivers public statements in multiple languages, including English, to appeal to people beyond his own ethnic group. “Abiy was probably the most popular candidate, the most favored candidate, by the public, broadly speaking,” said Hallelujah Lulie, a political analyst in Addis Ababa. That support has come in part because of the welcoming way in which Mr. Abiy has spoken about the street protests and demands for change, Mr. Hallelujah said — but he has always done so as a political insider, equally attuned to the demands of power inside the governing coalition. Previously, Mr. Abiy has been a soldier, an intelligence officer and a minister of science and technology, as well as the vice president of the Oromia region. The news was greeted with unexpected calm across Ethiopia, and with hope that life — and business — will go back to normal. Leaders of large companies have complained that foreign exchange has been difficult to come by, making business and investment difficult. “Our businesses were crumbling,” said Daniel Gebre, who runs an electronics maintenance shop in Addis Ababa. “It was very difficult to do anything because the roads were blocked and there was a shortage of goods.” Mr. Abiy’s appointment as prime minister will become official with the approval of Parliament, expected in the next two weeks. Mr. Mekonnen said the first real signs of the new prime minister’s strength and intentions would come when he named his cabinet — and if he decided to lift the state of emergency. His handling of the security agencies will be equally important. The intelligence and security services have a hand in the economy, Mr. Hallelujah, the analyst, said. Many Ethiopians perceive the security services — and the money and power they control — as dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, a wealthy minority that also controlled the governing coalition, until the Oromia protests forced talk of political change. But some people warn that the success of the street protests from Mr. Abiy’s region may also be his downfall, because sometimes violent protests can result in changes in power.",The New York Times
2018,"Ethnic Clashes in Northeastern Congo Leave Dozens Dead, Officials Say","GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Ethnic clashes between Hema herders and Lendu farmers in the northeastern province of Ituri in the Democratic Republic of Congo have killed more than 40 people, local officials said Friday. Tensions between the groups have been largely dormant since their battles from 1998 to 2003 left thousands of people dead, but violence has flared again in recent months because of disputes over land. At least 30 people were killed in two days of clashes last month between armed Hema and Lendu. Militia activity has increased across eastern Congo’s borderlands near Uganda and Rwanda in the past year, stoked in part by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down in December 2016 as required by the Constitution. Alfred Ndrabu, a member of the Roman Catholic Church’s Justice and Peace Commission in Ituri, said a colleague in the village of Maze had counted 49 bodies from Thursday’s clashes, which continued into Friday morning. “The Lendu and their allies attacked the village of Maze,” Mr. Ndrabu said. “They were pushed back by security forces.” “They returned with reinforcements,” he said, “which was when they perpetrated the carnage.” Jean-Bosco Lalo, an activist based in the provincial capital, Bunia, said his organization had so far recorded 43 deaths. He did not say who had initiated the violence. “It was a case of reprisals by the two communities,” said local army spokesman, Jules Ngongo, who did not yet have a death toll. “According to our information, there were cases of people being decapitated.” Millions of people died during conflicts in Ituri and elsewhere in eastern Congo around the turn of the century, mostly from hunger and disease related to the violence. Three warlords from Ituri have been tried by the International Criminal Court — two of them have been convicted — for their roles in those conflicts. Another is currently on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity.",The New York Times
2018,Eugenie Bouchard Has One Victory and Many Setbacks Off the Court,"INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Eugenie Bouchard scored a victory in court last month, gaining a favorable ruling from a jury and an undisclosed settlement for damages after suing the United States Tennis Association for a fall in the women’s locker room at the U.S. Open. But it was the only victory in recent months for Bouchard, 24, who is struggling on the tennis court and, increasingly, off it. The latest off-court development is the departure of her agent, John Tobias of TLA, who severed ties with Bouchard last week. Her list of sponsors was once long and lucrative, as she capitalized on her 2014 on-court success, but those relationships have dried up too. TLA was the fourth agency to represent Bouchard since she reached the Wimbledon women’s singles final in 2014. That is an unusual number for any professional athlete, especially in such a short time frame. She had previously been represented by two heavyweights in sports management, Lagardère and WME/IMG. “I didn’t agree with the way some things were being done, and felt it best if she found someone else,” Tobias said. After losing in the first round at the BNP Paribas Open here on Wednesday, Bouchard conceded that the parting with Tobias was not “by mutual agreement.” “I don’t have anyone in place right now,” she said. “A lot has been going on and it’s, like, the seventh thing on my mind right now. But after this tournament I’ll regroup, spend some time with my team and try to figure something out.” Three people with knowledge of Bouchard’s contracts said that three of her biggest sponsors did not renew their agreements this year: Colgate; the insurance company Aviva; and Usana, a line of nutritional supplements. With her longtime clothing sponsor Nike, Bouchard’s compensation is strictly performance- and rankings-based. That is a fairly standard part of the latter stages of those contracts. Bouchard is currently No. 116 in the WTA rankings. And according to two people with knowledge of Nike’s practices, the company is paying her zero dollars, as of March 1. It is expected that she will no longer wear a line exclusive to her. Of more pressing concern is the fact that her longtime contract with Babolat rackets expired at the end of 2017, and was not renewed. Two minor endorsements in recent weeks were made without Tobias’s knowledge and damaged the player-agent relationship. One advertisement has Bouchard promoting an e-book about cryptocurrency. She is seen posing near a basketball court, with the home page of the company’s website appearing on her mobile phone. The second shows Bouchard in full makeup pointing to a tube of chewable energy tablets from Neuenergy. Neither is a blue-chip endorsement with a well-established brand like Rolex and Beats, collaborations that characterized Bouchard’s endorsement portfolio until now. Both advertisements appear on Bouchard’s Instagram feed, which has more than 1.7 million followers and once was filled with various promotional posts. All that remains are photos from her latest appearance in Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue and pictures and videos of her training. After testing rackets during the off-season, Bouchard began the 2018 season playing with a Head model. But she quickly returned to her tried-and-tested Babolat Pure Aero by the time she competed at the Australian Open. On the practice courts at the BNP Paribas Open, Bouchard was still trying out rackets, even though the season is more than two months old. In her first official match since the beginning of February, she lost to the American qualifier Sachia Vickery, 6-3, 6-4, in an error-strewn effort that spoke to her lack of recent match play. Her preparation, cut short by the time spent in New York for the trial, was curtailed even more by an infection that required the extraction of two wisdom teeth shortly before she flew to California. The effect of the fall at the 2015 United States Open on Bouchard’s performance may never be fully quantified. She had been struggling that season long before she slipped and fell in the women’s locker room. But Bouchard had remained highly marketable despite her fall in the rankings. She has been given a significant number of wild cards into tournaments, including one into the main draw of the BNP Paribas Open this week. And her appearance in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue was a repeat performance from 2017. But it seems that now, the effects of her struggles on the court finally are being felt off it.",The New York Times

2018,Europe Once Saw Xi Jinping as a Hedge Against Trump. Not Anymore.,"BRUSSELS — A year ago, the self-styled global elite gathered at Davos, shaken by the election of Donald J. Trump, who made no secret of his contempt for the multilateral alliances and trade that underpin the European Union. Then up stepped the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, promising that if America would no longer champion the global system, China would. European officials and business leaders were thrilled. But a year later, European leaders are confronted with the reality that Mr. Xi could also be a threat to the global system, rather than a great defender. The abolition of the two-term limit for the presidency, which could make Mr. Xi China’s ruler for life and which is expected to be ratified this week by China’s legislature, has punctured the hope that China would become “a responsible stakeholder” in the global order. Few still believe China is moving toward the Western values of democracy and rule of law. Instead, many European leaders now accuse China of trying to divide the European Union as it woos Central Europe and the Balkan states with large investments. They are also wary of how China has become more aggressive militarily, in espionage and in its investment strategy abroad — with targets including its largest trading partner in Europe, Germany. For decades the European Union has benefited from the global system created by the United States after World War II, as has China. Even as Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin has remained a revanchist power, trying to destabilize the bloc and win back territories lost in the Cold War, China’s economic success has depended on stability and order — which benefited Europe, too. But the prospect of Mr. Xi as ruler in perpetuity has scrambled the equation. Many European leaders distrust Mr. Trump, who says he sees them less as allies than as competitors. But if moving closer to China once seemed like a smart hedge, at least while Mr. Trump was in office, now Mr. Xi also presents a problem — and he may not be going away. “We’re at an inflection point,” said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. “The Western world now understands that we have to take China’s push out into the world much more seriously than we have in the past.” Mr. Trump’s declaration that he will impose stinging tariffs on imported steel will hurt Europe more than China, another example of how Europe is getting caught between Washington and Beijing. European political leaders were already growing wary of Chinese intentions, especially given the vacuum of foreign policy leadership from the Trump administration and the persistent meddling from Russia. Last month, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel of Germany warned that China was pursuing its own model of world order and attempting “to put a Chinese stamp on the world and impose a Chinese system, a real global system but not like ours, based on human rights and individual liberties.” Mr. Gabriel was especially concerned about China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative, a huge infrastructure project promoted by Mr. Xi to expand Chinese power by developing new trade routes, including in Europe. To expedite this, Beijing has created the “16 plus 1” group, which brings China together with 16 European nations, 11 of them members of the European Union and the rest from the western Balkans. “If we don’t succeed in developing a single strategy toward China,” said Mr. Gabriel in an earlier speech, “then China will succeed in dividing Europe.” At the time, some regarded his remarks as alarmist. Less so now. Despite Germany’s huge exports to China and investment there — China is Germany’s largest trading partner, with two-way trade last year of $230 billion — even the German ambassador in Beijing, Michael Clauss, has openly criticized China’s policies and domestic repression, a marked change from years of German silence. Chinese companies have also made waves by buying a major German machine-tool and robotics company, Kuka, and then trying to buy a key semiconductor company, Aixtron. The latter bid was blocked by American objections on security grounds. The sudden purchase last week of nearly 10 percent of Daimler, the iconic German car manufacturer, by a much smaller Chinese car company, Geely, has also raised hackles, and questions about where the money, some $9 billion, really comes from. “It’s a highly public discussion about Chinese influence in Germany,” said Angela Stanzel, an Asia expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “There have been 10 times as many articles about Daimler than about Xi prolonging his rule.” Berlin and Brussels have been shaken amid concerns that the real intent of Beijing’s “One Belt, One Road” program is as much political as economic. “The main worry was China’s divide-and-rule policy,” Ms. Stanzel said. “The new worry is that because China is trying to make this format work, it will invest less effort and money into its relationship with Brussels.” Both Germany and France have been pushing the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, to draw up stricter investment screening regulations to better protect European companies and European security. Europe will have to find a new China strategy, Ms. Stanzel added, one free of any illusions, “because now we’re sure we’ll have Xi for the rest of his life.” Minxin Pei, a China scholar at Claremont McKenna College, said China’s actions in Europe, much like in the South China Sea, “have a probing quality, to test where the weaknesses are and where the pushback is.” Trade is only part of the overall security and geopolitical picture, he said, noting that Mr. Xi may be pushing too hard, too fast and that “this grandiose vision and ruthless actions are a bit premature.” Politically, the European Union has been troubled by convulsions in recent years as far-right parties have challenged the political establishment, while leaders in Poland and Hungary are challenging democratic norms. No European leader confused China with being an emerging democracy, yet analysts say many Western officials hoped and assumed the Chinese system would gradually become more like the democratic West. “I don’t know who is still fooling themselves about convergence and liberalization — Xi put an end to that long ago,” François Godement, a China scholar at Sciences Po in Paris. “Official China has been increasingly frank about a systematic competition with democracies.” By now, European leaders are accustomed to dealing with Mr. Putin and Russia. Mr. Xi is very different, says Susan Shirk, an expert on Chinese politics who served in the Clinton administration. “While Putin wants to be a spoiler, Xi wants to be respected as a global leader,” said Ms. Shirk, who is now director of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. “He hasn’t tried to subvert the structures that exist. But he has recently started to build his own.” With China returning to a more Leninist system, “we still don’t know what that will mean for global governance,” she said, “especially with Trump abdicating and trashing it.” Still, she said, the world must engage with China to get Mr. Xi “to fulfill his ambitions in the context of existing structures, and not overreact every time China takes the initiative.” For Europe, the prospect of China as a strategic competitor, as well as a political competitor, is a major challenge. “Europe is so disaggregated and so lacking in fortitude that its countries don’t think like big leaders,” said Mr. Schell. “America always has, but with Trump we’ve gone missing, and nature abhors a vacuum.” Now Mr. Xi’s open-ended tenure could give China a chance to plan long-term and carry out its policies systematically with “a steady hand on the helm of a great power,” Mr. Schell said. “But it is rooted in Leninism, autocracy and control, which will make it a tremendous challenge for liberal democracies rooted in a different value system, especially in a world reeling with no leadership.” OpinionMary Gallagher",The New York Times
2018,Europe Was Colder Than the North Pole This Week. How Could That Be?,"Subfreezing temperatures have spread across much of Europe over the past week, stretching from Poland to Spain. Snow fell in Rome for the first time in six years. Norway recorded the lowest temperatures of the cold snap: minus 43 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 42 Celsius) in the southeast part of the country on Thursday. And on Friday, Britain and Ireland were buffeted by a storm that brought snow and high winds, along with cold that was expected to linger for days. If Europe feels like the Arctic right now, the Arctic itself is balmy by comparison. The North Pole is above the freezing mark in the dead of winter; there are no direct measurements there, but merging satellite data with other temperature data shows that temperatures soared this week to 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). That is 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, and 78 degrees warmer than in parts of Norway. The Arctic warmth and the European cold snap have raised questions over whether the unusual weather occurrences are linked to each other, and if they are somehow related to climate change. Here are some answers. Probably, according to Judah Cohen, a climatologist who is director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a weather risk assessment firm. Dr. Cohen is the author of a 2017 study that linked a warming Arctic to the intermittent blasts of cold that those of us in the Northern Hemisphere have come to know as the polar vortex. The polar vortex is a low-pressure system that, as its name suggests, ordinarily rests over the North Pole. (There is also a polar vortex over the Antarctic.) When it behaves normally, the polar vortex helps trap cold air in the Arctic. “It’s locking in that cold air at the high latitudes in the Arctic region,” Dr. Cohen said, comparing the polar vortex to a dam holding back the frigid arctic air from the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. But sometimes that dam bursts as the polar vortex weakens and allows cold air to escape the Arctic to more temperate climes. This has always happened from time to time, but a growing body of research suggests that because of climate change the warming Arctic is weakening the polar vortex. Researchers are still figuring out how the warming Arctic is triggering the polar vortex’s aberrant behavior. Some of them, including Dr. Cohen, point to melting sea ice, caused by global warming. Dr. Cohen says the loss of ice creates patterns of high pressure near the Barents Sea and Kara Sea off northern Russia. That high pressure blocks the low-pressure system of the polar vortex, weakening it in the process. There is not yet a scientific consensus over the root cause of the weakening polar vortex; it’s fair to say that it is not as definitive as, say, the evidence for human-caused climate change, which is agreed upon by 97 percent of climate scientists. But it’s worth noting that in January the extent of Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever recorded for the first month of the year. In some parts of the Arctic the sea ice is already breaking up before winter’s end. And Arctic sea ice has been declining since at least the late 1970s. When the polar vortex weakens it allows cold air to escape and head south. This is what Dr. Cohen suspects happened in late December and early January when the Northeast United States endured some of its coldest temperatures on record. Other researchers who conducted a rapid analysis of the weather event aren’t so sure, though they stress theirs is just a first pass at the data. In the days leading up to the European cold snap, the polar vortex didn’t just get weaker, Dr. Cohen said — it split into two. One piece went into northern Eurasia and drifted westward into Europe, earning it the nickname “Beast from the East.” The other piece wound up in northwestern Canada, which led to the Western United States cooling off after an unusual warm period. “The West, that their winter is being saved to some degree, completely has to do with this polar vortex split,” Dr. Cohen said. But meanwhile, some countries like Spain that are wholly unused to the cold are freezing. Dr. Cohen likens the Arctic to the refrigerator in your kitchen. When the refrigerator door is closed, the fridge stays cold and the kitchen stays warm, but if you leave the fridge door open all the cold air comes out. Because air is spilling out of the fridge, it has to be replaced by surrounding air — air also has to flow into the fridge, or in this case the Arctic. And since the air outside the Arctic is warmer, it will necessarily move in.

It is in Bilbao, Spain, not San Sebastián. An earlier version of this story misstated an effect of climate change. Melting sea ice in the Arctic is causing more snow to fall in Siberia, scientists say; there is not a “lack of snow” in the region.",The New York Times
2018,European Automakers Prepare for an Electric Future,"Mike Reid loves his cherry-red 2016 BMW 335i sports sedan, especially the way this 2016 model accelerates and zips around corners. “It’s a fantastic car to drive,” said Mr. Reid, an investment manager and a part-time hockey player in Ann Arbor, Mich. “The pick up is incredible.” But when BMW starts introducing a new generation of electric cars in the next year or so, Mr. Reid is not likely to be rushing out to the showroom. Although electric cars tend to have a lot of torque, he’s just not sold on the idea of plugging in and charging batteries. “I wish there were something I could get excited about, but I kind of like the hydro-carbon-powered approach to my transportation,” he said. He added that he often headed into the wilds of Michigan to hunt and hike, places where he would be unlikely to find a good way to charge the car. And he said his neighborhood tended to lose power during storms, which could sometimes complicate charging at home. “I’m just not sold on the reliability of the technology at this point,” he said. “Gas prices are pretty low. My car gets good gas mileage. So electric vehicles? No, I’m not interested.” That type of sentiment presents a big challenge for Europe’s luxury carmakers. Many automakers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche and Volvo, are scrambling to produce lines of electric, hybrid and plug-in models. Some of this next wave will be on display at the Geneva auto show, which opens to the public on March 8. Among the models will be the Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-powered crossover that is something of a cross between a hatchback and a coupe. Jaguar unveiled the production version of the I-Pace last week in Graz, Austria, in a bid to build buzz ahead of the Geneva show. The car is packed with advanced safety and driver-assist technologies and features two electric motors — one to deliver power to the front wheels and one for the rear axle. Together they are rated at 394 horsepower. The car is expected to go 240 miles on a single battery charge, Jaguar said. The small vehicle, with its short hood, is also a jarring break from the classic Jaguar look of a low, sleek roof line, long hood and rounded back. “It’s quite distinctive,” Ian Callum, Jaguar’s design director, said at the Graz event. “It’s quite different. It’s quite radical.” The company is hoping the vehicle will appeal to upscale buyers who want to drive an upscale car that is also environmentally friendly. “It’s electric,” Mr. Callum said. “Guilt-free.” Volvo is expected to use Geneva to show the V60 station wagon, a plug-in hybrid and one of the models it is adding as part of a plan to add full or partial electric power to every one of its models by 2019. Volvo and its Chinese owner, Geely, are also developing a new brand of electric cars to be sold under the Polestar name. Details of the brand’s first model, the Polestar 1, will be released at the Geneva show. Audi is expected to offer showgoers test drives of the E-tron all-electric S.U.V. that is due in showrooms this summer. Those are only some of the electric models European carmakers have in the works. Daimler AG, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, is spending $11 billion to develop at least 10 new electric models, due on the road by 2022. Mercedes is expected to market them under the brand name EQ. BMW plans to introduce at least 12 electric models between now and 2025, including a self-driving car it is calling iNext. Before then, BMW plans to introduce improved versions of its i3 electric car and i8, an exotic sports car featuring a hybrid powertrain. While the company will continue offering cars powered by gasoline engines for years to come, BMW expects electric cars and hybrids to make up 25 percent of its sales by 2025. “At the core of our product offensive is a clear focus on electrification,” Bernhard Kuhnt, chief executive of BMW North America, said in January at the Detroit auto show. For the last several years, Porsche has offered hybrid versions of its sports cars and high-powered S.U.V.s, but in 2019 it is expected to add the all-electric car Mission-e. To ease worries about recharging the car, Porsche has started to install charging stations at its 189 dealers and at other locations in the United States. “What we are doing here is creating a new world for Porsche,” said Stefan Weckbach, Porsche’s head of battery electric vehicles. Carmakers are developing all of these models despite the reluctance of many car buyers. In 2017, 104,487 battery-electric vehicles were sold in the United States, less than 1 percent of the total market; 89,992 plug-in hybrids were sold. And manufacturers that have jumped in early have had a bumpy ride. BMW’s i3 has been a slow seller. Last year, BMW sold 6,276 i3s, fewer than the number of 3 Series sedans it typically sells in a single month. But one word convinces them that they are on the right track: Tesla. It is constantly on the minds of European makers, who fret about losing to the upstart maker of battery-powered luxury cars. Tesla sold more than 100,000 vehicles worldwide last year, making it a serious player in the upper-priced levels of the auto industry. The United States market is not the reason Europe’s automakers are racing ahead with electric technology, however. The European Union and China are tightening regulations that force automakers to cut tailpipe emissions. For years, many European manufacturers were counting on selling a heavy mix of diesel models to help them meet the stricter targets. But Volkswagen’s diesel scandal — the company for years equipped diesel cars with software that cheated emissions testing — has chilled sales and the willingness of governments to accept more diesels. Several large German cities have been pushing to ban certain diesel vehicles from their streets, and a landmark court ruing last month cleared the way for them to do so. Britain and France have said they intend to ban new diesel and gas cars by 2040. China has moved the same way on tailpipe emissions and is shaping regulations to increase sales of electric cars to combat the poor air quality in many of its congested megacities. Dieter Zetsche, the chairman of Daimler, said it was unclear when the market for electric vehicles would take off, but he was certain it would. “It’s like a bottle of ketchup,” he said in a conference call in January. “It will come. You just don’t know when and to which extent when you shake it.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated partial sales totals of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in the United States in 2017. During the year, a total of 104,487 battery-electric vehicles were sold, not fewer than 15,000, and a total of 89,992 plug-in hybrids were sold, not about 10,000.",The New York Times
2018,European Museums Get Adventurous With Virtual Reality,"PARIS — At the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, visitors can take a trip to an ice blue celestial plane surrounded by an aurora borealis. There, a branching orb traces 460 species, including humans, back to the last universal common ancestor, or LUCA, a small single-celled organism thought to be the common origin of all current life on earth. It’s a new permanent virtual reality installation at the museum, where visitors can don a headset to explore connections between species and zoom in on creatures, simulating the experience, for example, of standing right in front of an elephant to understand its magnitude. Bruno David, president of the museum, said it was impossible to illustrate the same concept if restrained to the traditional means of physical objects and text, so the museum turned to technology. The museum renovated a room to permanently house five VR stations and plans to offer a VR sea diving experience to coincide with a 2019 exhibition. Virtual reality, he said, could help make the taxidermy gallery — home to Louis XV’s pet rhinoceros — a little less stuffy. “My aim was to introduce technology of the 21st century into the world of a museum which is generally not regarded as such,” Mr. David said. France’s National Museum of Natural History is just one of many cultural and art institutions using the technology as a new way to engage visitors. While this museum has gone all in, others have been experimenting with VR before committing portions of their budgets. In 2015, the British Museum was one of the first institutions to offer a virtual reality experience through a weekend event dedicated to Bronze Age objects and showing them in their original context. Hannah Boulton, head of press and marketing at the museum, says it has been a testing process over the past few years to find where VR can have the most impact for the institution. “For us, it’s about audience engagement,” she said. “We don’t want to be doing it for VR’s sake. What we want to do is use VR where it can lend that extra context.” The museum has since also released a virtual tour of its Egyptian gallery that can be explored through either a web browser or a VR headset. Tate Modern in London has integrated VR into its current Modigliani retrospective in which visitors can explore the artist’s Paris studio. Since there is no photographic record of the artist’s final home, Tate undertook painstaking research to recreate it as a virtual reality space. A team took forensic-level photographs of the present-day studio, now private property, and designed furniture based on photos from the artist’s move, analyzed paint materials and took details from visitors’ diaries and letters. “VR has value for us as an interpretation tool,” said Hilary Knight, head of digital content at Tate. “It’s a way of conveying feeling, helping people feel a connection with an artist. It’s a different way of absorbing that information, and it makes the artist a living person.” While VR might be an obvious attraction for younger, tech-hungry audiences, institutions are finding older visitors are also eager to explore digital worlds. The National Museum of Finland in Helsinki uses a new VR feature to transport visitors into R.W. Ekman’s painting “The Opening of the Diet 1863 by Alexander II,” where they can speak with the Russian emperor and other depicted characters. Hanna Forssell, head curator of education, expected it to appeal mostly to the under-18 set that makes up one-third of the museum’s entries. Instead, she was surprised by the interest from all ages. When the feature started recently, she said, “There was a long line of mainly older people over 60.” Ms. Knight said she would like to use VR more in future exhibitions, but despite the success of the Modigliani experience, she is still uncertain about sustainability. Ms. Boulton also said the British Museum’s VR projects are “heavily funded” by technology partners. “It’s hard to create a strategy at the moment because we don’t yet know where funding for these kinds of projects will come from,” Ms. Knight said. “Visitors ask about future exhibitions, so there is an appetite.” Creating VR programs is expensive, especially for public institutions that have seen budgets slashed in recent years. Last year, the consumer electronics company HTC, which makes VR headsets, started VIVE Arts, a multimillion-dollar initiative that funds and develops VR content for museums and cultural institutions. Victoria Chang, director of VIVE Arts, said the program was born in response to an increase in the number of requests that HTC began receiving about two years ago and that continues to grow. “It was important for us to be able to foster this phenomenon in a more systematic way,” Ms. Chang said. She says VR will soon be just as important to a museum as its website. “When the internet was just developing, institutions didn’t see the need to have an online presence,” Ms. Chang said. “Now with social media and cellphones, all the major institutions have apps.” The Kremer Museum has gone even further, staking its entire existence on VR because the museum exists only as a virtual space. No lines, no crowds: just a solitary, private visit to a pristine gallery of 17th-century Flemish and Dutch masters. The VR experiences from Tate and the French National Museum of Natural History are available online to the public. As for critics who worry that might keep some people at home and out of museums, institutions agree virtual will never replace reality but can enhance it. “People are coming to a museum to see real objects because real objects are emotional,” Mr. David said. “If you’re going to L’Orangerie, it’s to see Monet’s original ‘Water Lilies,’ not to see a copy. Otherwise, on your computer you can see much better images than the real thing.”",The New York Times
2018,Europe’s Grandest Art Fair Draws the Faithful. But Can It Expand Its Appeal?,"MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands — Works made within the past 100 years are dominating the art market. Contemporary and modern pieces accounted for 73 percent of the value of all fine art auction sales in 2017, according to the second annual Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report, which was published Tuesday. European old masters generated just 7 percent of last year’s sales, even factoring in Leonardo da Vinci’s $450.3 million “Salvator Mundi.” The report said that Leonardo price “should be considered an outlier variable.” European old master pictures, and the works of art and decorative objects associated with them, were once the most prestigious status symbols that money could buy, but they are no longer the height of collecting fashion. Dealers specializing in these objects now look to sell their best pieces either to museums or to a relatively small pool of wealthy connoisseurs. The European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, whose 31st edition opened March 8, is the one event in the art world calendar where specialist dealers show a critical mass of museum-worthy art of the past. Last year’s event attracted more than 71,000 visitors over 10 days. “There are so many dealers in one place. In terms of the decorative arts, there’s nothing comparable,” said Gloria Groom, chairwoman of European painting and sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago. She said she was one of six members of the museum’s staff visiting the fair, which this year featured 275 exhibitors. Such is the quantity and quality of the pieces on show in Maastricht that curators — and, equally important, groups of private patrons — from institutions such as the Art Institute of Chicago; the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles make the pilgrimage from the United States every year. But this year, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam beat the Americans to a star museum piece. The London dealer Benjamin Proust was offering on consignment the original wax model for “The Genius of the Medici,” a bronze fountain sculpture now in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, Italy. Dating from the 1550s, the statue, showing a young boy seated on a pedestal and raising an orb, was identified as a work by the Florentine sculptor Bartolomeo Ammannati. The wax model, owned by a private European collector, was included in an exhibition on Ammannati at the Bargello museum in Florence in 2011. Frits Scholten, senior curator of sculpture at the Rijksmuseum, spotted the sculpture. He was given first refusal at a museum discount price of 700,000 euros, or about $866,000, and fast-tracked the Dutch institution’s purchase, according to Mr. Proust. Mr. Proust said he had deliberately avoided marketing his star piece before the fair opened. “Everyone should be surprised,” he said. “If I send out stuff before the fair, why should they come?” Who does and doesn’t come to Tefaf is an ongoing concern for its exhibitors and organizers. In an attempt to widen the fair’s international appeal — and to reach out to American collectors reluctant to travel to Europe after the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels — Tefaf collaborated with the art investment advisory firm Artvest Partners to start fall and spring fairs in New York in November 2016 and May 2017. Under the aegis of Christophe van de Weghe, the new chairman of the fair’s Modern section, Tefaf’s spring edition, scheduled for May 4-8, will feature powerhouse galleries who currently do not exhibit in Maastricht — including Gagosian, Hauser & Wirth and David Zwirner. But has this diluted the appeal of the mother fair in the Netherlands? “There could be a handful of people who won’t come to Maastricht because of Tefaf New York. But it will increase awareness of the brand,” said Howard Shaw, president and director of Hammer Galleries, a New York dealership that exhibits at both Tefaf Maastricht and New York Spring. “I can’t tell you how many of my clients haven’t heard of this fair.” In Maastricht, Mr. Shaw sold the small but vibrant Vincent van Gogh canvas “Lilacs,” painted in Paris in 1887, priced at $9.5 million. It had been owned by the foundation of the gallery’s creator, Armand Hammer, since 1971. Though the arrival of leading international galleries such Perrotin, Massimo de Carlo and Mazzoleni gave an extra edge of quality to Tefaf Maastricht’s Modern section, most of the truly exceptional objects and sales remained concentrated in the booths devoted to older artworks. “There’s a freshness about the fair this year,” said Ms. Groom of the Chicago Institute of Art. “There are more revelations.” The top-of-the-range Paris dealers Kugel Gallery sold an opulent ivory and silver gilt astronomical clock, made in the 1630s by the Augsburg goldsmiths David I. Schwestermuller and Daniel Zech. The price of the so-called Bulgari Clock was a closely guarded secret. Also kept quiet was the price of a newly discovered half-length canvas of St. Stephen from the 1640s by the Neapolitan baroque painter Bernardo Cavallino, which sold before the fair opened by the Rome dealership Giacometti Old Master Paintings. Retaining its original frame, and fresh from a private Italian collection, this was regarded by many as the outstanding old master of the fair. It was bought by an American private collector. Among the confirmed sales, the London dealers Agnews found a private European buyer for “The Serenade, or The Ambulant Musicians,” a multi-figure composition by Jacob Jordaens that was once owned by Empress Joséphine, Napoleon’s first wife. Painted around 1640-5, this was another recent rediscovery and was priced at $5 million. It was first offered, however, at Tefaf New York last fall. Tefaf has signed up for a further 10 years in Maastricht. The agreement has followed assurances from the local authorities that the fair’s tired 1980s venue, the MECC Maastricht, will be revamped, luxury hotel rooms created and travel links improved. But will demand for the fair’s traditional “destination” strength of old master art and objects be set for an upgrade, too — particularly if collectors tire of today’s increasingly formulaic contemporary market? Clare McAndrew, who from 2008 to 2016 wrote much-referenced art market reports for Tefaf and now does it for Art Basel and UBS, is not so sure. “Old masters could become more popular again, but it’s doubtful if it could swing back in a big way,” Ms. McAndrew said. “The supply is so thin.” Unlike today’s counterparts, Ammannati and Cavallino didn’t make art in editions of six.",The New York Times
2018,Europe’s Planned Digital Tax Heightens Tensions With U.S.,"WASHINGTON — A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms. On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley’s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates. The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules. The global tensions — and the dueling tax efforts — stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions. But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports. “Tax and trade have basically merged” as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been trying to coordinate global efforts to combat tax evasion. In a report on digital taxation issued on Friday, which was separate from the European Union proposal, the organization said that more than 110 countries agreed to review the international tax system, parts of which had been rendered obsolete by the digital economy. Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies. “We think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,” Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. “It is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.” He added: “To the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.” Pascal Saint-Amans, the director of the O.E.C.D.’s Center for Tax Policy and Administration, said that the level of animosity could undermine what had been a coordinated, global effort to crack down on tax avoidance. “There are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,” Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that “these countries don’t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.” The European Union’s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business. For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay. Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union’s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon. Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion. Within the past few years, the European Commission has ordered Apple to pay €13 billion in back taxes and levied fines against other tech giants for abusing their dominant market positions. In January, European antitrust officials fined Qualcomm, the chip maker, €997 million for illegally shutting rivals out of the market for certain smartphone and tablet chipsets for more than five years. Qualcomm said it would appeal the ruling. Last year, the European Commission fined Google €2.42 billion for using its search engine to favor its own comparison shopping service — called Google Shopping — in search results while demoting results of rival services. Google has appealed the ruling. Now, as the European Union prepares to institute comprehensive new data protection rules in May, European regulators have opened a novel line of attack. They are investigating the tech giants’ vast information-gathering operations as potential anti-competitive abuses. In December, Germany’s federal cartel office said Facebook had abused its dominant position by requiring its users to let the social network “limitlessly amass” data by tracking them through other online services — including the Facebook-owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp. Antitrust regulators said they were “not convinced that users have given their effective consent” to Facebook’s data practices and that the extent of the data collection violated mandatory European data protection principles. In a blog post, Facebook said that it was cooperating with the German agency, but challenged the claim that it had a dominant position, saying that the social network was merely “popular in Germany.” The company also said it would “be working directly with relevant data protection officials” to ensure compliance with the upcoming European data regulation. The European Commission’s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top €50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union. The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc’s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses. “The taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,” said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. “Some member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.” As the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate. In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president’s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses. But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules. There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington’s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.",The New York Times
2018,Even Popular Gun Law Proposals Have a Tough Road in Florida,"MIAMI — The Florida State Senate shocked even itself on Saturday when it voted to approve a two-year moratorium on sales of AR-15 semiautomatic rifles, going far beyond the gun-related measures that Republican legislative leaders said they would consider. Tellingly, though, that two-year moratorium lasted only 15 minutes. It had been approved by a voice vote, and opponents quickly insisted on reconsidering it, this time with a roll call to formally record how each senator voted. Evidently that turned some of the ayes heard by the Senate president into nays, because the proposal was defeated, 21 to 17. The moratorium episode — the closest that Florida’s Democratic gun-control proponents have come to success after a Feb. 14 shooting rampage, at a high school in Parkland, left 17 people dead — illustrates why it is so difficult to pass firearm restrictions in the State Legislature: When it comes to backing a significant change, even a popular one, the votes just aren’t there. In the rare Saturday session, the Senate debated a Republican-sponsored bill that would raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 from 18; mandate a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases; ban bump stocks, which enable semiautomatic rifles to fire much faster; and set up a voluntary program to arm trained schoolteachers and pay them a stipend to participate. Democrats offered a slew of amendments over eight hours of debate on the bill, including a permanent ban on assault weapons and the elimination of the armed-teacher program. Both of those changes would be popular with Florida voters: A Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed that 62 percent favored an assault weapons ban and 56 percent opposed giving teachers firearms. The 15 Democrats in the State Senate presented a united front, but it mattered little. Republicans hold 23 of the Senate’s 40 seats (two are vacant), leaving Democrats with too few votes to block bills on their own. And though the map of State Senate districts was redrawn by court order in 2016 to make it more fair, only a few Republican senators represent competitive districts, where voting against gun control might hurt them in a general election. As a result, Democrats managed to get just one amendment passed: adding 12 hours of required diversity training for participants in the program to arm teachers. That was meant to address black lawmakers’ concerns that teachers with guns might discriminate against black students in deciding when to use them. Students from the school in Parkland, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, sprang into political action after losing classmates and teachers in the Feb. 14 mass shooting. They traveled by the busload to Tallahassee, meeting with lawmakers, chanting in hallways and protesting on the steps of the State Capitol in favor of stricter gun laws. But Parkland is in Broward County, the most heavily Democratic county in Florida. No Republican senator represents any part of the county; there was no chance of one of them breaking party ranks to side with student survivors from the district. The only two Republican senators who did consistently vote with the Democrats on Saturday were Anitere Flores and René García, representing neighboring Miami-Dade County. That is Florida’s most populous and most urban county, where even Republican constituents tend to be less strident about gun rights than in the rest of the state. A third Republican senator, Tom Lee, from the Tampa Bay area, joined in efforts to scrap the statewide armed-teacher program, which he called needlessly divisive, noting that local sheriffs and school superintendents can already set up such programs where they are wanted. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, has maintained that he does not want to arm teachers. He is widely expected to run for a United States Senate seat this year, and knows he will have to appeal to voters beyond his own party in a race against the incumbent Democrat, Bill Nelson. But the calculus is different for the speaker of the House, Richard Corcoran, a likely candidate for governor in a crowded Republican field. Mr. Corcoran would like to appeal to President Trump’s voter base in his party’s primary, and he has backed the armed-teacher program enthusiastically, calling it a “game changer.” The Senate president, Joe Negron, also a Republican, suggested a possible compromise on Friday, arming noninstructional school personnel rather than teachers. Mr. Scott did not respond last week when asked whether he would accept that. One way or another, though, Mr. Scott has said he is determined to pass the gun package, which would also include significant funding for school safety and mental health measures, before the end of the annual legislative session, which is scheduled to wrap up on Friday.",The New York Times
2018,"Even With Takeover Bid Blocked, Qualcomm ‘Is in a Tight Spot’","SAN FRANCISCO — President Trump appeared to bail out Qualcomm on Monday by blocking Broadcom’s hostile takeover attempt of the chip maker, citing national security fears about China. But Qualcomm’s management team may not be out of the woods. Another arm of the United States government, the Federal Trade Commission, contends that some of Qualcomm’s key business practices are illegal. So does Apple, the most influential trendsetter in wireless phones. Such legal threats, and some signs of shareholder support for Broadcom’s $117 billion bid, suggest that Qualcomm’s chief executive, Steven Mollenkopf, may still be in the hot seat. That means the company, which is based in San Diego, may need to take new steps to assuage investors unhappy with its performance. “The feedback on the ground was a manifest dissatisfaction with the management team,” Edward Snyder, an analyst at Charter Equity Research, said of what he had heard from Qualcomm’s shareholders. “Qualcomm is in a tight spot at this point.” A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment. Directors will likely give Mr. Mollenkopf more time to execute on promises to increase Qualcomm’s profits, said a person close to the company who declined to be named because discussions are confidential. Changes have already been taking place. This month, Qualcomm’s board had announced the replacement of Paul Jacobs, a son of one of the company’s founders, as executive chairman in favor of an independent chairman. It has also made plans to trim $1 billion in expenses and raise its dividend by 9 percent, further attempts to convince shareholders that management intends to improve returns. Qualcomm had earlier decided to reshape its business by buying NXP Semiconductors, a $44 billion transaction that would take Qualcomm into many chips used in cars and other products. Regulators in China have yet to approve that transaction, and Mr. Trump’s order could prompt them to delay or block the deal, said Chris Caso, an analyst at Raymond James. The chip maker will also be closely scrutinized for any progress on the legal front — particularly making peace with Apple, which has been withholding patent payments after starting a court battle over Qualcomm’s licensing practices. The company is also under the microscope for how well it can exploit the next generation of cellular networks, based on a technology known as 5G. Qualcomm has led cellular transitions before. The technology pioneer’s chips manage communications and run apps in smartphones. But the company earns most of its profits by licensing patents to handset makers, using a royalty formula based on a percentage of the wholesale price of the phones. That two-part structure has triggered many scraps with antitrust authorities over the years. Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive, repeatedly said Qualcomm’s business model was broken, vowing to move quickly to change it and end the company’s legal woes. But Qualcomm says patent royalties are essential to allow the company to fund development of new wireless technologies years before chips incorporating them hit the market. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government panel that recommended that Mr. Trump block the deal, argued that Broadcom’s strategy of limiting spending on long-term research and development could impede Qualcomm’s leadership and aid Chinese rivals like Huawei. “Changes to Qualcomm’s business model would likely negatively impact the core R&D expenditures of national security concern,” the committee, known as Cfius, wrote in a March 5 letter to the companies. The Federal Trade Commission attacked some patent-related practices in an antitrust suit filed against Qualcomm in January 2017. The suit said, among other things, that Qualcomm got an unfair advantage in negotiating patent licenses because its customers feared it could cut off supplies of chips they needed to keep making handsets. As a result, the F.T.C. argued, the company can press for higher royalties than other patent holders charge. Qualcomm has denied wrongdoing, and is vigorously contesting the F.T.C. and Apple cases, as well as others in Europe, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Broadcom may face fewer repercussions after its apparent loss in the four-month takeover battle. The company, which specializes in buying chip makers and selling off less-profitable pieces, may turn to other acquisition targets soon, analysts said. Broadcom is scheduled to report quarterly financial results on Thursday. The company did not immediately return a request for comment. Beyond the two chip giants, Mr. Trump’s blocking of the Broadcom bid raises already high barriers to foreign takeovers in the industry. Cfius has repeatedly blocked semiconductor acquisitions by companies in China since 2016. But Mr. Trump broke new ground by taking action against a Singapore-based company that was in the process of moving its headquarters to the United States. Members of Congress are now considering even tougher legislation to impede American companies looking to set up joint ventures in China, a frequent requirement for doing business there but one that critics feel can transfer sensitive technology to foreign rivals. “The entire system is going to be under a lot more scrutiny,” said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a policy think tank. “I think we’re living in a new world now.”",The New York Times
2018,"Even by Trump Standards, a Lot Has Happened This Week. Let Us Catch You Up.","There has been a lot of news this week, and it’s hard to keep track of it all. Including White House staff shake-ups — President Trump is on to his third national security adviser — and major trade action against China, here are six of the biggest stories driving American politics this week. (And some links to other stories if you want to read further.) The House passed a $1.3 trillion government spending bill, called an omnibus, on Thursday that would fund the federal government through September. With a deadline looming, the Senate took up the bill early Friday morning and passed it, 65 to 32. There was a catch: Mr. Trump threatened to veto the bill. He reversed his threat, however, and announced on Friday afternoon during a news conference at the White House that he had signed the legislation. The signing prevented what would have been the third government shutdown this year. Spending Plan Passed by Congress Is a Rebuke to Trump. Here’s Why. Trump Signs Spending Bill, Reversing Veto Threat and Avoiding Government Shutdown Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster resigned. General McMaster, a battle-tested Army officer, became Mr. Trump’s national security adviser after Michael T. Flynn was pushed out in the early days of the administration. The president announced Thursday that John R. Bolton, the former American ambassador to the United Nations, would take his place. The choice of Mr. Bolton, who was considered a hawk among hawks when he served in President George W. Bush’s administration, was immediately met with both acclaim and criticism. John Bolton, an Undiplomatic Voice for American Might 3 Examples of John Bolton’s Longtime Hard-Line Views How the Left and the Right Reacted to John Bolton as National Security Adviser It’s the strongest trade action that the president has taken so far against a country he blames for lost American jobs and revenue. The White House, which says the measures are in response to China’s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets, will come up with a list of products that will face tariffs within 15 days. In response, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced it was proposing its own set of tariffs on American goods. Financial markets plunged on fears of a potential trade war between the world’s two largest economies, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropping by 2.5 percent. Responding to Trump’s Tariffs, China Shows ‘Cautious Anger’ Trump’s Trade Threats Put China’s Leader on the Spot Trump Just Pushed the World Trade Organization Toward Irrelevance Trump’s Tariffs: Another Retreat From the Postwar World Order Last weekend, The New York Times published an article about how Cambridge Analytica, which consulted for the Trump campaign, harvested private information on Facebook to help profile and influence American voters. On Friday, The Times reported that the company was hired early on by a political action committee founded by Mr. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s incoming national security adviser, who knew about the data harvesting. Facebook has also come under fire since the revelation that its data was misused, with many users considering a departure from the social media platform. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, released a statement on his own Facebook page and told CNN that he would be “happy” to testify before Congress “if it’s the right thing to do.” Cambridge Analytica also suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections. For Many Facebook Users, a ‘Last Straw’ That Led Them to Quit Data Firm Tied to Trump Campaign Talked Business With Russians John Dowd resigned as the lead lawyer on the president’s team for the special counsel’s investigation. He is said to have left over a disagreement about whether Mr. Trump should agree to be interviewed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. This comes days after Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Mueller on Twitter. It was a signal that the president was increasingly ignoring the advice of his lawyers in favor of a more aggressive posture toward the investigation and an attempt to clear his name.

I’m not that kind of girl.’” Mr. Trump is also facing accusations of an affair with Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress who goes by the name Stormy Daniels.

2018,Every Plant Has a Story. You Just Need to Dig.,"Greg Grant, a horticulturalist and raconteur, is restoring the rural Texas homestead where his family has lived for five generations. Greg Grant has planted longleaf pines, growing here in a field of goldenrod, on his land in Arcadia, Tex. In a few months he will use a controlled burn to stimulate native grasses and wildflowers while controlling hardwoods and shrubs that compete with the pine.CreditCreditAllison V. Smith for The New York Times As a matter of habit, Greg Grant leaves his varmint gun at home when he gives a garden tour. But on a late winter Saturday afternoon in Arcadia, Tex., while Mr. Grant was tramping between a stand of native bamboo and a spray of spider lilies, Sonny Boy Desalvo Fontenot caught wind of an armadillo. Sonny Boy, one of Mr. Grant’s four critter dogs, started barking and baying, and Acer, the Jack Russell, joined in. Next, the rat terriers got into it. And the botanical lecture came to a temporary halt. “We didn’t bring a gun,” Mr. Grant said, as he peered through the woods for the dog pack. “They’re not happy until you’re all involved.” The armadillo — or maybe a skunk? — had worked its way into tree roots above the red clay banks of Grandma’s creek. And the furious barking had persuaded the animal to stay put. Mr. Grant, 55, has roamed these acres since he was a boy. He is, in fact, the fifth generation of his family to occupy the little house up the hill. He’s the seventh generation to live here in Shelby County, in the piney woods between Dallas and Shreveport, La. And as the area’s pre-eminent horticulturist and de facto natural historian, Mr. Grant knew how to handle a cornered armadillo: walk away. “You do have long arms,” Mr. Grant said to me. “If you want, you can reach up in there and get it out.” Rain check on the country hospitality, thanks. The home gardens that Mr. Grant has been restoring here for the past 30 years leave no room for fussiness. He plants and weeds with a tractor disc and a Bush Hog. He manages invasives, woody brush and weeds with a gas can and a drip torch. On one hand, the way he gardens is practical. Mr. Grant has been purchasing empty buildings and property up and down the road: He maintains three houses, the church picnic grounds, the derelict town store and the mail cubbies salvaged from the old Arcadia post office. And you can’t manage 50 acres with a hand trowel. On the other hand, the approach appears to be philosophical. “It’s got to be my grandparents’ landscape,” he said of his garden plan. “It’s got to be able to have raccoons, possums, squirrels, snakes, birds, deer.” In truth, Mr. Grant rarely encounters problems with deer nibbling his historic tea roses or his vast repository of pass-along bulbs: forgotten jonquils, crinums and narcissus. A deer-proof plant is any specimen surrounded by four barking terriers that live outdoors and off-leash. In garden design, a name exists for the style of old-fashioned — and proudly unfashionable — landscape that Mr. Grant wants to nurture here. “It’s a farm,” he said. All of Mr. Grant’s parcels lie along a two-lane farm-to-market road, running south to north. You could walk it in 20 minutes. But this being Texas, we hopped in the truck. Mr. Grant rolled past his second house, white with a pyramidal roof, which previously belonged to Miss Lou, the late shopkeeper. Behind the building lies his next project: 20 acres of longleaf pine savanna. Or the start of it, at least. Two centuries ago, the longleaf — Pinus palustris — covered 90 million acres of the American Southeast: vast reaches from the Carolinas to East Texas that supported more than 200 bird species. Logging swallowed big swathes of the savanna; cotton and sugar plantations chewed up the leftovers. Today, less than 3 percent of the ecosystem remains. The longleaf pine, with its tufts of needles, some 18 inches long, looks a little like the bearskin hat worn by the Queen’s Guard, stuck on a teetering rack. Starting a few years back, Mr. Grant transplanted 12,000 trees (“not all of them survived”). Next, he scattered an understory of grasses: little bluestem, big bluestem, splitbeard bluestem, broomsedge bluestem, et cetera. Controlled burns each spring clear out the oaks and hardwoods that predominate everywhere else. Mr. Grant’s father, Neil, operates a large cattle ranch adjacent to his son’s property. He refers to Mr. Grant’s nearby “pocket prairie” as a “weed patch” and offers the services of his tractor. “Dad has 1,200 acres,” Mr. Grant said. “He takes forests and turns them into pastures. And I buy pastures and turn them into forest.” Big Momma’s House marked the next stop on Mr. Grant’s show-and-tell: the dwelling of Mr. Grant’s great-grandparents, where his father played as a child. Mr. Grant hired a carpenter friend to renovate the structure, with its pine clapboard walls and 14-foot ceilings. “Renovating,” to be clear, means “rusticating”: stripping out every architectural element or domestic appliance invented after 1920. Practically speaking, Mr. Grant said, “My rules were no ‘P’s’ in the house: no plastic, no plywood, no PVC.” Mr. Grant lived at Big Momma’s for a couple of years, and he still comes back daily to shower in the bathroom with the .22-caliber Ruger rifle over the toilet. (“My great-aunt kept a gun there,” he said.) With its boxy geometry and dogtrot porch — three rooms on one side of the breezeway and two on the other — the folk-style house looks like a collaboration between Donald Judd and Annie Oakley. Mr. Grant said: “Anyone can look at a plantation home and say it’s important to preserve that. And everybody did. But I think darn few people could look at the most rudimentary, simple, vernacular house and say, ‘Those are important and need to be saved.’ And nobody did.” Back in the truck, Mr. Grant pointed to a tumbledown shack on the west side of the road. (Preservation plan B? Ruins.) This home last belonged to Crazy Larry, he said. “It was my grandmother Ruth’s sister — who died in a car wreck — her husband’s second wife’s son.” Along with being the keeper of the bulbs and buildings no one else wants to claim, Mr. Grant has become the caretaker of half-forgotten names. He estimates that of the 500 people who once occupied the community of Arcadia, he could classify half as kin. (The current population stands at 57.) Mr. Grant sometimes applies a country term to his background and pastimes: “redneck.” Be that as it may, Mr. Grant has also written six books. His latest, “The Rose Rustlers” (written with William C. Welch and published last fall by Texas A&M University Press), describes the hunt for lost Southern roses, and the effort to repopularize them in Texas gardens. For a time, Mr. Grant worked with Dr. Welch at the Antique Rose Emporium, near College Station, Tex. This specialty nursery would grow out cuttings discovered by the Rustlers in cemeteries and unkempt yards, then return these robust and fragrant roses to new gardens. A decade later, Mr. Grant established his own heritage farm to spread the hardy but hard-to-find bulbs that he had collected from his neighbors. These tales feed the lectures that Mr. Grant gives to garden clubs. Over the years, he has delivered more than 1,500. “Every plant has a story,” Mr. Grant will say. “If you don’t have a story, I will give it a story. ‘You bought a plant at Lowe’s, you fell and skinned your knee, and the cat peed on it.’ That’s the story: It starts there.” This old plant stuff also became the germ plasm that Mr. Grant has tapped to breed and select new ornamentals. The goal: plants that will thrive in Texas and beyond. A well-adapted narcissus, for instance, will bloom beyond a year or two. Twenty is a reasonable minimum; 200 would be better. “I went to horticulture school to learn to grow things,” he said. “And now what I grow is plants that grow without me. I wasted my parents’ money.” Mr. Grant has introduced more than 50 cultivars: roses, bluebonnets, mums, phloxes, salvias, verbenas. These plants carry the names of friends, colleagues, grandparents, first ladies (“Laura Bush” is a disease-resistant petunia) and beloved dogs. Several of his bulletproof best-sellers earned the label “Texas Superstars,” a crown in commerce. Jerry M. Parsons, a retired professor of horticulture and an early mentor, said Mr. Grant possesses a matchless eye for color and variations in foliage. “It’s not a trick,” Dr. Parsons said. “It’s a gift from God, is what it is.” While gardens may be his life’s vocation, Mr. Grant maintains a conflicted relationship with the horticulture trade. “I don’t like selling stuff, period,” he said. Accordingly, Mr. Grant has spent the better part of his career in university jobs. A lot of them. Mr. Grant has worked in every office and niche of academic horticulture: research, teaching and extension. For versatility, this is a little like the gardening equivalent of chasing the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony). Dr. Welch, who first taught Mr. Grant 30 years ago, likes to characterize his friend’s peripatetic career in an anecdote. “Did you hear about when he applied for a new job?” Dr. Welch said. “The same day he showed up for work, he gave them a letter of resignation so they’d have it handy.” Mr. Grant’s friends may have wondered, privately, what kept him coming back to his family land in Arcadia. At last, he’s found a good answer. Last September, Mr. Grant said, the self-described confirmed bachelor married. From Mr. Grant’s habit of socializing with elderly gardeners, his mother, Jackie Grant, said, “I always thought he would marry an old woman.” Not so. The new Mrs. Melanie Grant, 47, first dated Mr. Grant when she was an undergraduate at Louisiana State University. He was a graduate student and the adviser of the horticulture club. A quarter of a century later, she tracked him down, like a lost rose, on his garden blog. “I Googled Greg,” Mrs. Grant said. “He leaves an impression on everyone, not just me.” Mr. Grant said, “Notice she didn’t say ‘good impression.’ Just ‘impression.’” He continued, “I was always married to my job, my career in horticulture.” He’d created a homestead tailored perfectly to one (and only one) person. Mr. Grant recalled that people would tell him, “No woman is going to live in that house with you.” This assessment proved correct. “She came in and looked at the bedroom and said, ‘I’ll never spend a night in this house.’” “And I didn’t,” Mrs. Grant said. “I called it ‘The Museum.’ It was not livable.” “It didn’t have central air and heat,” Mr. Grant said. Mrs. Grant said, “In the summer! In Texas!” Grandma Emanis’s old house includes both heat and air now. Cable TV, too. Mr. Grant has turned his novel domestic arrangement into an opportunity to do something quite familiar: that is, overhaul the garden. He compiled an inventory of Mrs. Grant’s favorite plants — a cape jasmine gardenia, sweet olive, daisies, blackberries. Within a couple of months, he’d put them all in the ground. “I’ve got to take the house from horse barn to Pottery Barn,” Mr. Grant said. It’ll take a generation or two.",The New York Times
2018,Everybody Needs a Bit of Sparkle,"PARIS — On a cold evening several weeks ago, a coterie of editors and influencers gathered around a candlelit table at the restaurant Caviar Kaspia here for a dinner party hosted by De Beers. After the finale of Champagne and strawberries, diamond bracelets, necklaces and rings were served up for the guests’ review. They all whipped out their smartphones — and tapped the KiraKira+ icon, the wildly popular app that adds twinkling effects to iPhone and Android pictures and videos. “I remember when friends on the front row first started using KiraKira+ last season, we were all completely obsessed and wanted to know what it was and how we could use it too,” said Doina Ciobanu, a model and fashion blogger based in London who has 372,000 followers on Instagram. Her sparkle-enhanced content proved a huge hit, she added, and she has used the app regularly, particularly for jewelry posts. “I think people are always looking for something new and fun that can make their pictures really stand out,” Ms. Ciobanu said. “KiraKira+ helps users do that, and is particularly female orientated, given how pretty and dreamy it makes everything look.” KiraKira, which means sparkly in Japanese, was introduced in 2015 by Kentaro Yama. He created the app as a side project to his full-time job at Tha Ltd., an interactive design studio in Tokyo. But after its enthusiastic adoption last fall by Eva Chen, Instagram’s head of fashion partnerships, its success has been stratospheric. At 99 cents in the Apple iOS store, it’s now rated as the second most-popular app in the American store’s Photo & Video group. The app, which works through a phone’s camera, highlights any reflections or hint of shine in an image with a shimmery twinkle, and filters allow for varying degrees of color intensity and sparkle. Last month, Swarovski became the first brand to partner with the app, sponsoring a new Brilliance filter inspired by the aurora borealis. Fans of the app include the makeup artist Pat McGrath, the supermodel Rosie Huntington Whiteley and all the Kardashian clan. And the Belgian makeup expert Peter Philips loved KiraKira+ so much that it inspired the beauty look he created for the Dries Van Noten spring 2018 show. Mr. Yama, who also has developed two other photo-editing apps, A-HDR and AHDR2, said that he was delighted by social media users’ appetite for sparkle, and the success of what had been just a hobby. Far more economical than buying actual diamonds, it’s an app that is a shine of the times.",The New York Times
2018,Everyday Wines: The Most Important Bottles You Will Drink,"The Pour Books have been written about the marvels of Montrachet, the complexities of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti and the luscious wonders of Yquem, all remarkable wines that most people can only dream of being able to afford. Instagram is lined with photos of the proverbial unicorn wines, bottles so rare that they are sighted with the frequency of mystical animals. Somehow, these shots often seem to be posted by sommeliers, proving that such bottles are scarce only for those without access to other people’s money. As much attention as is paid to the rare and profound bottles that fire the imagination, far less is devoted to the sorts of wines that people might actually consume at any given weeknight meal. Yet the bottles we might open every day are actually the most important wines in our lives, just as the art we live with in our homes is ultimately more meaningful than what we might see on an occasional visit to a museum. The rare bottled masterpiece may stretch the mind, enlarging our notion of what wine can be and the emotions it can provoke. These special bottles, if we are lucky enough to drink one, occupy an exalted place because they set benchmarks and stretch context as they surprise and astound. But the simpler pleasures of everyday wines shape our attitudes and desires, pique the curiosity and fire the imagination. They forge our relationship with wine, and ultimately define its role in our lives. The joys of one cannot be understood without the pleasures of the other. Missing out on either side distorts the whole. But I would argue that for people who love wine or who want to understand it better, paying more attention to everyday wines rather than rare and expensive bottles can improve one’s drinking life significantly. This especially holds true for wine authorities of all kinds. Rather than paying lip service every once in a while to “good values” or “Tuesday night bottles,” I would like to see regular, purposeful attention directed at everyday wines, good bottles that are moderately priced and easy to drink in relaxed, casual settings, yet are still interesting enough to inspire wonder and to be deeply pleasurable. The world is full of these sorts of wines, yet paradoxically they seem hard to come by. How can that be? Over the last 25 years, an explosion in diversity has blown apart the once-simple framework for getting to know and understand wine. Here in the United States, we now have access to more different sorts of wines than ever before, from more places, in more styles, made often from grapes that were largely unknown at the end of the 20th century. But rather than make the job of finding and selecting a good, interesting bottle easier, this new diversity seems to have made it more difficult. So many choices can be confusing. Rather than take a chance on the unknown, many people choose instead to settle for familiar grapes, enticing brand names and well-known places. I have great sympathy with this point of view. We have only so much time and energy to absorb new ideas, especially in a world in which the unexpected arrives at frightening speed. Good food and good wine are not everybody’s priority. Even if you would like it to be a more important part of your life, wine still comes in too many varieties and from too many places to comfortably and quickly absorb. So I would like to offer some practical recommendations to make it easier to drink better every day. Think of wine as food. If you care where your food comes from, how it’s raised, grown or made and about its ethical and health consequences, apply that same logic to wine. You will end up with wine that is grown and made more conscientiously, with greater thought and care. Your wines will be less likely to be widgets and more likely to be expressions of culture. Topple wine off its pedestal. It’s just a beverage, a pleasurable drink. It should be thought of as a staple of the table, like bread or olive oil. It’s not just for special occasions, it’s not only ceremonial, it does not require special tools to enjoy or unusual powers of taste or smell to know what’s good and what’s not. We know oysters are wonderful, for example, but some people cannot abide them, and the same is true with certain wines. It’s just personal taste, not a judgment of one’s personality or character. Think of the occasion, rather than what’s at the top of a universal scale of greatness. Many might agree that grand cru Burgundy or first-growth Bordeaux or older Barolos are among the very best wines in the world. But those might not be the best wines for a weeknight, when you are tired and want a quick bite and an easygoing bottle. On those occasions, the very best wine might be a good Finger Lakes riesling, or a basic Etna Rosso, not a profound Chambertin. Find a good wine shop. This greatly increases the odds of finding good bottles, because conscientious merchants have weeded out much of the dreck. Avoid supermarkets and other indifferent outlets. Though you may find the occasional decent bottle, they are full of processed wines and vacuous brands that are the equivalent of empty calories. Rely on merchants and sommeliers. Nobody knows the wares better than the merchants who buy them. In good shops, ask for help. Tell them your budget, maybe what you are cooking, or the kinds of foods you like to eat if you are buying more than a bottle or two. This direct approach is far more useful than looking at apps that aggregate scores or purport to discern your taste. Merchants want return business. Forging a good relationship will pay off sooner than you think. The same is true in restaurants, where good sommeliers are more concerned with your happiness than in upselling you to more expensive bottles. They want you back. Spend a little more. For $10, you can find many sound bottles, but I’ve long argued that at $15 to $20 the potential for quality and excitement increases exponentially. I realize that for many people that is a lot to spend on wine every day, or even every other day. But nonetheless, that’s the reality of wine pricing. If it’s too much, maybe try it once a week. Commit to diversity. I don’t like to think in terms of house wines, likable bottles that are bought in bulk. So many great wines are available today that it seems a shame for the sole choice to be white or red. This is not to say that you should avoid buying age-worthy wines by the case. It’s a great pleasure to drink the same bottles over the arc of their existence, to see how they evolve. That’s a lot different from drinking the same wines every night. Explore. If you stick only with inexpensive versions of well-known, high-status grapes like pinot noir, chardonnay or cabernet sauvignon, you will rarely find good value. Many of these cheaper bottles are processed with technology or flavorings to imitate expensive bottles. Instead, you will find better values by seeking out honestly made wines from little-known grapes and largely unknown areas. If you can take these steps, you will be on your way to drinking much better. Other things can be helpful, like having some decent wine glasses. But nothing is more important than the wine itself. Good wine will still be good consumed from tumblers, but even the best glasses won’t help a mediocre bottle. One more element will help to further the appreciation of everyday wines: Broaden the definition of greatness. Every worthy type of wine has a role to play. Pairing bottles to occasions is every bit as important as pairing wine with food. For too long, we have thought of great wines solely in terms of their potential to age, to evolve, to be profound and to be complex. These are all wonderful attributes, and they define wine at its highest level. But maybe we need to think of greatness in terms of how well wines can play their role. If certain bottles are accessible enough to be everyday wines, yet interesting enough to capture our attention while refreshing and delighting, isn’t that great as well? I think so.

2018,Everyone Wants ‘Power.’ Everyone Thinks Someone Else Has It.,"First Words Our usual message to children is that they have a lot less authority than they might wish. Parents, teachers, adults: These are the people, we explain, who are in charge. But in March, as tens of thousands of children across the country flooded out of their classrooms to protest gun violence in schools, the moment was hailed by some as a tremendous display of power — perhaps especially in those places where school administrators flexed their own authority and tried to prohibit students from participating. “Supporters say the walkouts and demonstrations represent a realization of power and influence by young people,” The Washington Post reported. “So amazing to see young people take back their power and USE it!” Miley Cyrus tweeted. “By myself, I don’t think I have the power,” one student told MSNBC. “But together with all these people here, I think we can make a change.” The very reason for the demonstrations, of course, was that the students did not possess one very specific kind of power — the ability to make rules or laws that might somehow curtail the number of guns and shootings in their schools. This lack of control over their own safety has been a key aspect of their rhetoric ever since survivors of the February shooting in Parkland, Fla., captured the nation’s attention via Twitter. “We’re children,” David Hogg said in an appearance on CNN. “You guys are the adults.” At least one senator seemed to agree, locating the real power not with the students but with the audience they addressed: “Keep speaking truth to power and demanding change,” Kirsten Gillibrand urged. In theory, that power resides with the nation’s voters, but even this is too indirect; we already know that Americans overwhelmingly favor more stringent gun regulation than their elected officials are inclined to enact. It is a much smaller segment of people who hold the clearest authority to change things: the professional political class. And even as those children demonstrated, a healthy portion of that class was studiously ignoring them and earnestly debating the merits of arming teachers instead. If they were in any real way affected by the power of a student walkout, they certainly weren’t admitting it. The students’ power to captivate a share of the public sat in one corner; elected officials’ power to actually rule over that public sat quietly in another. No matter how thundering the children’s dissent might have been, there was no meaningful intersection between those two kinds of power. In 1990, the Harvard international relations scholar Joseph Nye published a book, “Bound to Lead,” in which he drew a distinction between two different forms of power. One was what he called “hard” or “command” power — the traditional guns-and-money leverage one nation could use to force another nation to do what it wanted. For the other, he coined the term “soft power” — meaning “when one country gets other countries to want what it wants.” Soft power was more seductive than coercive; it could be built on culture, on ideals, on leading by example. Nye’s terms are now used by political scientists and business-school professors alike. They are a product of the same line of thinking that appears in a common expression: “Power comes in many forms.” This is the same line of thinking too that so often has undergraduate students intoxicated by the ideas of the French theorist Michel Foucault, who saw power as ephemeral, taking countless shapes, everywhere and nowhere: It was “at once visible and invisible, present and hidden, ubiquitous,” like a light emanating from a thousand pinprick sources. Foucault’s idea of resistance was to spend your time mapping out all those pinprick sources of power, like the stars: If you wanted to speak truth to power, he suggested, you first had to divine your position inside a whole constellation of influence. This sort of thinking can make our view of power far more nuanced and complex, but it can also make it quite confusing. The dispiriting message some took away from Foucault was that things were, ultimately, a bit hopeless: Power was far too chaotic to help anyone figure out the right thing to do. This dizzying and disordered vision of power isn’t reserved for high-stakes international affairs or abstract philosophical contexts. It is a feature of almost every social or cultural battle we have. The question of power has buzzed its way, for instance, through a huge share of recent conversations about sexual harassment. In many #MeToo stories, the power a harasser has over his target is clear and hard as a diamond: He is the boss; he can hire or fire, promote or demote. But in so many others, a softer pull is involved — a matter of age, or ambient status, or standing within an industry. Last month, when several women told NPR about what they saw as exploitative relationships with the writer Sherman Alexie, one described her account as one “about power, and abuse of power.” This wasn’t because Alexie necessarily held any formal or official power over the other writers he encountered; the power his accuser was referring to derived from his literary success, influence and social standing. People hold countless opinions about accusations like this, and plenty of them have already been aired at great and contentious length. But even within those arguments, the question of who holds “power” is a constant, each side insisting it lies with the other. In a Slate interview with Isaac Chotiner, the writer Katie Roiphe, who has expressed skepticism about what she sees as the rush to judgment of #MeToo, described being pilloried in response. When Chotiner tried to suggest that being vilified by Twitter users might not be so consequential, the two reached an impasse. “You are saying they don’t have power, but I think they do have power,” Roiphe said. She saw a group of social media critics and writers as having the power to set the terms of the conversation; they undoubtedly felt the same way about her, a tenured professor scolding them from the pages of a prestigious publication like Harper’s. It was this point, Chotiner said, that was “the crux of our disagreement.” Which is in its own way a summation of where we all are: Everyone, from the online critic to the president, seems always to believe that power lies elsewhere, in some branch of the constellation beyond their reach. Try to map out almost any part of this cultural moment, and you will find something similarly chaotic — all the players passing by one another, each convinced they are doing the right thing, and very few convinced that they, in the face of powerful opposition, have enough influence to affect much at all. Those who feel inspired by cultural moments like the student walkout tend to be struck by how easy it can feel, once a certain critical mass builds, to sweep away what once seemed like entrenched and unassailable sources of might. “Power is like money: imaginary, entirely dependent on belief,” Tim Kreider wrote in a Times Op-Ed in March, urging the young to rise up against the usual order of things. “Most of the power of institutions lies in the faith people have in them.” But the slippage between those two sentences — between “entirely” and “most of” — is not always easy to overcome. Some power is very concrete; some power really is a gun to your head. And the fact that some of it is very soft — that it is socially constructed, or dependent on belief — does not make it any less real. It is indeed just like money, just not in the way Kreider thinks: You may conclude that dollar bills are mere worthless symbols of value, but your lack of faith will not prevent your starving to death without them. The chaos and multiplicity of power, then, can be something of a magic trick, keeping us arguing forever about who has it. Which isn’t to say there isn’t room for clarity about certain definite, reliable sources of power. The science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, for instance, found it difficult to believe in any single, stable reality — but in a 1978 essay, he explained how even an anarchic world could have its masters. He believed in creating new realities, he said; he’d dedicated his life to it. But he didn’t think all realities were created equal. “Unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudorealities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms,” he said. “I do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot of it.” He was talking, back then, about television and the Disney corporation. Today, though, it’s easy to hear those words and think of Facebook, or Twitter, or any of the “electronic mechanisms” on which our broad movements of anger or disinformation emerge. Right now the owners of these platforms seem to believe they are merely facilitating maps of every point of power in the universe. They thrive on all our little contests and arguments about who has power over whom and eschew responsibility for any of the chaos created by them. But as we’ve learned in recent weeks, there is actual power accruing to the hosts of all our debates, and to the maps they make of us — maps others may use in trying to manipulate, say, the outcome of an election. This power is concrete, and its source obvious. It is worth, as Dick says, our distrust.",The New York Times
2018,Everything You Always Wanted to Know About a Reporter’s Interest in a Woody Allen Remake,"People often ask me where an article of mine came from, and my answer, quite frequently, is “How much time do you have?” “The Woody Allen Reboot You Won’t See at the Oscars (or Maybe Anywhere),” about a remake of “Annie Hall” with a cast from a Manhattan senior center, began more than 700 miles from New York City, at Indiana University, where Matt Starr took a class about New York’s downtown avant-garde art world. “It changed my life,” Mr. Starr, now 29 and living in New York, said. Among the artists covered in the class was the filmmaker Jonas Mekas, whose movies struck a chord with Mr. Starr: “Jonas is just a living legend,” he said. Mr. Mekas, 95, is also one of six older New Yorkers whom I started following three years ago for a New York Times series called “85 and Up,” and, more recently, a book drawn from the series, “Happiness Is a Choice You Make: Lessons From a Year Among the Oldest Old.” The presence of Mr. Mekas drew Mr. Starr to the series. Sometimes I think Jonas Mekas is my connection to half the world. In early January, after the latest installment in the series, “Want to Be Happy? Think Like an Old Person,” in which I wrote about the joys of spending time with older people, Mr. Starr contacted me on Facebook. He and his directing partner, Ellie Sachs, 25, had just finished making “My Annie Hall,” starring a 94-year-old man, Harry Miller, in the Woody Allen role, and Shula Chernick, 73, as Annie Hall. We were telling the same story in different media. “Annie Hall” had been one of my favorite movies, but I was more drawn by the generational drama playing out among the new film’s principals. Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs and their artist friends were struggling to get by in a city that was increasingly unwelcoming to young people and artists. Mr. Miller and Ms. Chernick and their friends from the senior center, by contrast, were bouncing between art openings and lectures and free movies at the center, returning at night to Upper East Side apartments for which many paid anachronistically low — and frozen — rents. “They’re all dating and having a great time,” Mr. Starr said. “We have bills to pay, it’s New York, and we’re either doing what we like and not making enough money to live a comfortable life, or we’re doing what we hate and making enough money, and not happy.” Plus, he told Ms. Chernick, “You’re much more active than our friends.” Mr. Miller, who is not dating, said he had never been happier. Sociologists call this the “paradox of aging,” citing research that shows older people are more content and less stressed than teenagers or young adults. “There is a life satisfaction that sets in with older adults, but 20-year-olds are the most tortured generational group we know,” said Jessica Balboni, who runs the senior center where the gang all met. “Not just for the living conditions, but developmentally — who am I, what’s my identity, who am I going to become?” Ms. Chernick sympathized with the young directors. “We had challenges coming up, but I don’t think life was as difficult as it is now,” she said. “It wasn’t as costly. And I enjoy the little things. I walk down the street and I can’t be unhappy when I see a baby or some of the dogs.” Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs said they were trying to get there. In the meantime, they had new friends and surrogate grandparents. As for Mr. Miller, he hoped his next movie would allow him to sing and dance. He even had a number he was interested in, made famous by Maurice Chevalier: “I’m Glad I’m Not Young Anymore.”",The New York Times
2018,Ex-Chief of C.I.A. Suggests Putin May Have Compromising Information on Trump,"WASHINGTON — John O. Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Wednesday that he thought Russia may have some kind of compromising information on President Trump, setting off furious speculation about whether the former spy chief was basing that assertion on inside information. In an appearance on Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Mr. Brennan, who served as C.I.A. director from 2013 to 2017, speculated that Russians “may have something on him personally” when he was asked if he thought Mr. Trump was afraid of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “The Russians, I think, have had long experience with Mr. Trump, and may have things that they could expose,” he added. Mr. Brennan was running the C.I.A. when a salacious dossier surfaced in 2016 that claimed the Russians had compromising information on Mr. Trump. If there were any current or former American officials who might know if there was truth behind the allegations in the dossier, Mr. Brennan would most likely be one of them. And his comments came the day after a phone call Mr. Trump made to Mr. Putin congratulating him for winning an election raised new questions about the president’s relationship with Russia. As C.I.A. director, Mr. Brennan was never known as particularly chatty around the news media or in public. And since leaving office, Mr. Brennan has taken to starting conversations with journalists by telling them, “I’m not going to be an anonymous source for any stories.” But last weekend, Mr. Brennan — in response to Mr. Trump’s praise for the firing of the former deputy director of the F.B.I., Andrew G. McCabe — issued a remarkable condemnation of the president. “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” Mr. Brennan wrote on Twitter. Mr. Brennan’s pointed criticism of Mr. Trump on MSNBC and on Twitter was hardly unique. From the outset of the Trump presidency, a litany of retired intelligence officials — the kind of people who have traditionally shied away from criticizing presidents, even in retirement — have come forward to criticize Mr. Trump. The former officials have included those like Mr. Brennan who served under Democrats and others who served under Republicans, such as Michael Hayden, who ran both the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency under President George W. Bush. Nearly all insist they have no desire to wade into partisan politics, but are genuinely alarmed by what they see as Mr. Trump’s fundamental disregard for the rule of law and his impetuous approach to the nation’s security. So Mr. Brennan’s latest accusations on Wednesday quickly became fodder for news articles, social media conspiracy theories and hours of speculation on cable news channels. And his remarks seemed to go beyond what he had said publicly in January 2017, five days before he stepped down as C.I.A. director, when he had said the dossier was “unsubstantiated” and his criticism of Mr. Trump was relatively mild. “I don’t think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia’s intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world,” Mr. Brennan said then in an appearance on Fox News. But later in the day on Wednesday, Mr. Brennan explained that his comments were speculation based on Mr. Trump’s words and deeds, as well as how Mr. Putin’s government has operated at home and abroad — but not on any inside knowledge. “I do not know if the Russians have something on Donald Trump that they could use as blackmail,” he said in a written response to questions from The New York Times. “When asked the question, I have pointed out the perplexing submissiveness of Mr. Trump toward Mr. Putin — despite continued evidence of malign Russian activities,” Mr. Brennan added. “I do not know why he refuses to call out Russia; that is a question that can only be answered by Mr. Trump.” Along with Mr. Brennan, who is a paid contributor to NBC and MSNBC, other retired officials with contributor deals included James Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; Steven L. Hall, the former director of Russia operations at the C.I.A.; and Jeremy Bash, a former C.I.A. and Pentagon official. Mr. Hayden, in an interview, made the case for former intelligence officials becoming talking heads of a sort, saying he believed that it was important for Americans to understand what the country’s intelligence agencies did and did not do. He also said he tries to bring the skills he learned as an intelligence officer to his public appearances, providing analysis based on facts. “Lord knows CNN has enough people just throwing opinions,” said Mr. Hayden, who is a paid contributor to the network. “I try not working backward from assumption but build forward from data.” He added, “John has a right to say what he says — I also have trouble explaining events with regard to the president and Russia.”",The New York Times
2018,Ex-Equifax Executive Charged With Insider Trading Tied to ’17 Breach,"A former top Equifax executive was charged on Wednesday with insider trading for selling nearly $1 million in company stock after he learned about a major data breach in 2017 but before it was publicly announced. Jun Ying, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s core United States consumer reporting division, exercised all of his vested stock options and sold nearly $1 million in shares a little more than a week before Equifax announced that hackers had broken into its systems, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The breach compromised sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, of more than 140 million Americans. Mr. Ying avoided $117,000 in losses because of the timing of his sale, the S.E.C. said in a civil complaint. The United States attorney’s office in Atlanta announced parallel criminal charges against Mr. Ying on Wednesday. “Corporate insiders who learn inside information, including information about material cyber intrusions, cannot betray shareholders for their own financial benefit,” said Richard R. Best, the director of the S.E.C.’s office in Atlanta, where Equifax is based. Stock trades by Equifax employees have drawn scrutiny since the breach was disclosed. Four senior executives, including the consumer credit reporting agency’s chief financial officer, sold shares worth $1.8 million in the days after the company began investigating the breach and more than a month before the public was told of it. After conducting its own investigation, the Equifax board concluded that none of the four executives knew of the breach when they made their trades. Mr. Ying’s trades were different. He was not among the executives whose trades initially came under scrutiny. On a Friday afternoon in late August, an email went out to several top executives at Equifax asking them to begin work immediately on an emergency project related to a “VERY large breach Opportunity,” according to the S.E.C. complaint. Mr. Ying was one of the recipients. Later that day, after a brief conversation with David Webb, Equifax’s global chief information officer, Mr. Ying began to understand the extent of the problem, the S.E.C. said. He texted one of his employees: “We may be the one breached … Starting to put 2 and 2 together.” Three days later, a Monday, Mr. Ying exercised all of his vested options to buy Equifax shares, and then sold them immediately. Mr. Webb, who was Mr. Ying’s boss, retired in September, shortly after the breach was disclosed. Equifax offered to promote Mr. Ying to fill the vacancy. The offer was rescinded when the company learned of Mr. Ying’s stock trading, according to the S.E.C.’s complaint. In an interview on Wednesday, Julia Houston, Equifax’s chief transformation officer, said the company learned of Mr. Ying’s trades during an internal investigation. On Oct. 16, the company summoned him to a meeting at which it planned to fire him, she said. Mr. Ying resigned instead. Equifax alerted the S.E.C. and the Justice Department about Mr. Ying’s trading, Ms. Houston said. “We take corporate governance and compliance very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of our policies,” Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., Equifax’s acting chief executive, said in a statement. Ms. Houston declined to comment on whether the company is investigating any other suspicious trading activity. Mr. Ying declined to comment through his lawyers at the firm Schulte Roth & Zabel. Mr. Ying’s LinkedIn page shows that he left Equifax in October. It lists his current job as “a little bit of everything. Stay tuned.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Ex-Justice Stevens’s Call to Repeal the Second Amendment,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Repeal the Second Amendment” (Op-Ed, March 28): The retired justice John Paul Stevens is right to highlight the Second Amendment’s role in the gun debate, including the fact that it is sometimes deployed as a “propaganda weapon” against gun regulation. It is also important to recognize that, as a matter of law, the Second Amendment is perfectly consistent with gun regulation. Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller (from which Justice Stevens dissented) emphasized that “the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.” He enumerated a wide range of “presumptively lawful” gun regulations, including bans on possession by felons and the mentally ill, dangerous and unusual weapons, and the carrying of weapons in sensitive places. In more than 1,000 Second Amendment cases in the decade since Heller, courts have fleshed out those categories. They have struck down stringent (and extremely rare) laws like bans on public carry. And they have upheld the vast majority of reasonable gun laws. People sometimes say they oppose gun regulation because they support the Second Amendment, or vice versa. The gun debate is difficult enough without that false dichotomy. JOSEPH BLOCHER, DURHAM, N.C. The writer is a professor at Duke University School of Law. To the Editor: This Op-Ed article is precisely why more people don’t support gun control. Articles like this imply that anyone who wants sensible restrictions to prevent mentally ill teenagers from shooting up schools also wants to repeal the Second Amendment. John Paul Stevens does not speak for me or scores of other people who support both gun rights and responsible gun sales. He is holding the gun control movement back, not pushing it forward. SARYTA RODRIGUEZ, NEW YORK To the Editor: Rather than subject the country to a prolonged, deeply divisive and likely unsuccessful campaign to repeal the Second Amendment, would it not be preferable to revise its language so as to reflect contemporary social concerns (such as gun violence) while preserving the time-honored right to bear arms for legitimate purposes? This would require us to agree on three main points: 1) gun ownership is a central part of American life; 2) all but a tiny minority of gun owners use them safely and responsibly; and 3) any restrictions on access to, as well as ownership or use of, firearms should apply only to those who might harm others (and themselves) with these weapons. A revised Second Amendment could read as follows: “The right to bear arms for hunting, sport and recreation being a cherished and time-honored tradition, the exercise of this right by responsible persons for these purposes shall not be infringed.” JOHN V.H. DIPPEL SALISBURY, CONN. To the Editor: John Paul Stevens has finally declared out loud what gun advocates have desperately tried to avoid: that the Second Amendment is obsolete. The National Rifle Association shouts that our freedoms are at risk, while Rick Santorum, a former senator, recommended that student protesters stop exercising their First Amendment rights and instead learn CPR. While many of us waste time feeling outraged over the controversial statements, we lose sight of the real goal — eliminating an amendment written by founding fathers whom history has judged to be wrong about several important issues. Recent protests provide hope that the younger generation will prioritize strict gun regulations as they mature into positions of greater influence. Meanwhile, I fear for the generation of children who have to go to school while the adults of today bask in inaction. MARCO STARGERBRIDGEWATER, N.J. To the Editor: Three cheers for John Paul Stevens! The Second Amendment was intended to equip a militia, but we haven’t had one in centuries. It is as quaint as the Third Amendment, about quartering of soldiers. How many Americans are concerned about discovering an uninvited soldier in their living room? ARMAND W. LORANGERBEDFORD, N.Y. Opinion OpinionJohn Paul Stevens",The New York Times
2018,"Ex-Leader of Baltimore County Schools, a Tech Booster, Pleads Guilty to Perjury","A former superintendent of Baltimore County Public Schools, the 25th-largest district in the United States, pleaded guilty on Thursday to four counts of perjury related to payments totaling about $147,000 that he received for consulting and speaking engagements. The state said the former superintendent, Shaun Dallas Dance, had made false statements on his financial disclosure forms “to conceal the nature and extent of his outside business interests and conflicts of interest.” Among other sources of income, the state said, Mr. Dance received payments from a school leadership training company that he had helped win an $875,000 no-bid contract from his school district. After his financial relationship with that school vendor became known, the state said, Mr. Dance falsely told a Baltimore County Public Schools ethics panel that he had not been paid by the company while it was doing business with the district. He also provided the ethics panel with what the state described as a “sham” service agreement with the company supporting his false claims. Prosecutors have asked for a five-year sentence and said they wanted Mr. Dance to serve 18 months of it. A sentencing hearing was scheduled for April 20. Andrew Jay Graham, a lawyer representing Mr. Dance, declined to comment on the case. Verletta White, the interim superintendent of Baltimore County schools, said in a statement, “We are saddened by the news but trust the judicial process.” Mr. Dance has been at the center of questions about close relationships between Baltimore County school officials and education technology companies seeking the district’s business. An article in The New York Times in November profiled the district as a case study in how tech companies court and cultivate relationships with school officials. Mr. Dance, who became superintendent in 2012 and announced his resignation 11 months ago without citing a reason, was no longer employed by the district and was already under investigation by the state when The Times’s article was published. His actions have been also been the focus of reporting by The Baltimore Sun. Baltimore County’s schools had embarked on an ambitious technology makeover, committing more than $200 million to providing laptops for students and millions more on no-bid contracts for learning apps. The Times found that tech industry-funded groups or vendors paid for flights to conferences, as well as hotels and dinners, for school officials. In court documents, the state said Mr. Dance had concealed about $12,000 in payments he received through his consulting work in 2015, including $4,600 from the Education Research and Development Institute — ERDI for short — an organization that pays superintendents to attend meetings with educational tech companies. ERDI has charged companies $13,000 to organize a meeting with five superintendents or other school leaders to discuss products, according to documents obtained by The Times. After Mr. Dance participated in confidential meetings with two of his district’s tech vendors at an ERDI conference last year, the district extended both companies’ contracts. The district continues to pursue large technology deals — with a $140 million contract for student and staff laptops awaiting a vote from the school board.",The New York Times
2018,"Ex-Model, Mob Suspect and a Murder Could Bring Down Slovakia’s Government","BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — When a former Miss Universe contestant and topless model was given a plum government job as an assistant to Slovakia’s prime minister despite having no discernible qualifications, journalists asked the obvious question. Why? Among them was Jan Kuciak, an investigative reporter. After months of digging, Mr. Kuciak sent questions to the authorities, looking for a response to what seemed like troubling connections between government officials and people suspected of being part of organized crime. Days later, he was killed. Mr. Kuciak’s body was found on Feb. 25 on a stairway in his home. His fiancée, Martina Kusnirova, was killed in the kitchen. The bullet hole in the top of her head indicated that she had been on her knees when she was executed. But if the goal of the killings was to cover up corruption and silence a critical voice, it failed spectacularly. The deaths have instead forced a reckoning in this small central European country. The government of Prime Minister Robert Fico is now in danger of falling as public anger swells and the scale of corruption comes into focus. On Friday, tens of thousands of people gathered in the heart of the capital, Bratislava, in a show of solidarity, despite warnings from Mr. Fico that there could be “possible attacks.” More than 50 similar gatherings took place across the country. The killings of Mr. Kuciak, who worked for Aktuality.sk, a news website, and his fiancée come less than six months after a car bomb killed another journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, in Malta. She was also investigating government corruption. The killings have raised concerns across the continent about threats to a free press at a time when journalists are already under almost daily verbal assault from populist leaders. Slovakia has been one of the biggest cheerleaders of the European Union, even as leaders from Poland to Hungary to the Czech Republic have presented different challenges to the cohesion of the bloc. But long before Donald Trump had popularized the phrase “fake news,” Mr. Fico regularly attacked journalists as “hyenas” and “presstitutes.” After the murders, he has not reflected on his past rhetoric. Instead, Mr. Fico has decided to adopt some of the conspiratorial language of the leaders of neighboring countries. This week, Mr. Fico found a familiar foe to blame for his problems, telling the public that the globalist George Soros was behind efforts to undermine his government. The Slovak president, Andrej Kiska, accused Mr. Fico and the ruling party of “an arrogance of power” and said that the only way to regain the public trust was a “radical reconstruction, or early elections.” In turn, Mr. Fico accused Mr. Kiska and the news media of “dancing on the graves” of the victims. After saying he would pay a bounty of one million euros to anyone who helps find the killers, Mr. Fico called a news conference where he laid bundles of cash on a table as evidence of his seriousness. Critics saw the move as a further reflection of a mob mentality where cash can solve any problem. Michal Vasecka, the director of the Bratislava Policy Institute, said that the prime minister has succeeded only in stoking more outrage. “We knew this country was dramatically corrupt,” Mr. Vasecka said. “But it is now clear that the whole system is corrupted and is like an octopus overwhelming the entire country.” One week ago, thousands took to the streets mainly to mourn Mr. Kuciak and Ms. Kusnirova. During Friday’s demonstration, nearly everyone in the crowd raised their arms, keys in hand, and jingled them together, a symbol of the peaceful protests of the 1989 Velvet Revolution that turned out the Communist government. Zuzana Benkovska was 15 then, when she joined the protest in the same square. Now 44, she said she went on Friday for her children. “It is different this time, because the murders of these two young people has touched everyone emotionally,” she said. “Even though they were 27 years old, everyone saw them as children. And we all have children.” One organizer, Katarina Nagy Pazmany, 28, said it was simply “unacceptable for a journalist to be murdered in a democratic country and the motive to be tied to his work.” “We demand a thorough and independent investigation of Jan Kuciak’s and Martina Kusnirova’s murder with participation of international investigators,” she said. “And we call for a new and trustworthy government without people who are suspected of corruption and connections to the organized crime.” The public frustration could be seen at the dozens of shrines that have popped up in towns and cities across the country, where photos of the young couple look out over a mass of candles, flowers and signs calling for change. “Indifference makes us accomplices,” read one handwritten sign. At another shrine, a T-shirt stained blood red had a message: “Lies will be killed by the truth.” Many of the shrines were placed under commemorations of the Velvet Revolution in 1989, when the country broke free from the Communist bloc. Sona Szomolanyi, 71, a professor of political science at Comenius University in Bratislava, said the atmosphere felt similar today. She noted that it was the rumored death of a young student, in 1989, that spurred mass protests and the eventual fall of the government. (The report proved untrue.) Corruption has long bedeviled Slovakia, which is a member of both NATO and the European Union. Intrepid local journalists have exposed all manner of malfeasance over the past two years, but there have been virtually no prosecutions of top officials. The government’s response to accusations — “the deed did not happen” — has been repeated so often it has become a bad joke. When thousands of protesters took to the streets last year, they carried banners with the words in bold letters. But there is no denying the deed now. While corruption may have once seemed complicated and abstract, the deaths have made it real. “All the dirt has come to the surface and is now visible and personal,” Dr. Szomolanyi said. Indeed, before he was killed, Mr. Kuciak had found that the model turned government adviser, Maria Troskova, was connected to an Italian businessman, Antonino Vadala, fond of racing his Lamborghini along the remote roads where he lived in the Slovak countryside. The two had lived together, and founded a company together. Mr. Kuciak also discovered that Mr. Vadala had been named in Italian court documents in connection with the ‘Ndrangheta, the Calabrian organized crime syndicate. He uncovered links between Mr. Vadala’s business dealings and top government officials and indications of a scheme to embezzle European Union funds meant to bolster agriculture in the country. Mr. Vadala did not answer questions when reporters visited his house, but he denied any connection to organized crime or any wrongdoing in an interview with a local paper. Ms. Troskova, who has stepped down from her government job, has also denied any impropriety. Far from being frightened into silence, journalists at Mr. Kuciak’s website Aktuality have picked up where his reporting left off. Peter Bardy, the editor in chief, sat in a conference room turned war room at Aktuality. On one wall were a dozen photographs of people suspected of being involved in shady dealings — from businessmen to top officials. Nearby, was a diagram linking Mr. Vadala’s companies to politicians and other businessmen to government officials. It makes for a spider’s web difficult to untangle. But Mr. Bardy said the journalists owed it to Mr. Kuciak to keep digging. Mr. Kuciak’s investigation was undertaken with the support of several international organizations, including the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, and a special newsroom has been set up in Bratislava, open to journalists from around the world. “We are sharing our information with any journalist who wants,” Mr. Bardy said. There are now armed police in the lobby of Aktuality, a new reality in a country that had thought of itself as having moved a long way from its socialist past and the wild early days of democracy. But Dr. Szomolanyi said there was a ray of hope to be seen in the current mess. “Despite all the problems,” she said, “the reaction of the ordinary people to these deaths really does show that we belong in the West.”",The New York Times
2018,Ex-Playboy Model Karen McDougal Details 10-Month Affair With Donald Trump,"The former Playboy model Karen McDougal gave her first television interview about the affair she alleges she had with Donald J. Trump more than a decade ago, saying that he offered her money after their first sexual encounter. “After we had been intimate, he, he tried to pay me — and I actually didn’t know how to take that,” she told Anderson Cooper of CNN in an interview broadcast on Thursday night. “I looked at him and said, ‘That’s not me, I’m not that kind of girl.’” As a security aide of Mr. Trump’s drove her home, she said, “I started crying, I was really sad — it really hurt me.” But, she said, in spite of that encounter in 2006, “I went back,” conducting what she described as a 10-month, serious relationship that she finally ended when she could no longer bear the guilt of betraying Mr. Trump’s then-new wife, Melania. Pressed by Mr. Cooper on what she would say to Mrs. Trump now, Ms. McDougal looked directly into the camera, tearing up, and said, “What can you say except, ‘I’m sorry — I’m sorry.’” Ms. McDougal’s interview made for a jarring, split-screen news night, with the major presidential headlines toggling between the allegations about an extramarital affair from a former Playboy model and Mr. Trump’s decision to remove his national security adviser H. R. McMaster and replace him with John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations. The interview came despite an agreement Ms. McDougal struck during the 2016 presidential campaign with American Media Inc., which owns The National Enquirer, to sell it the exclusive rights to her story about Mr. Trump in a $150,000 deal — part of what is known as a “catch and kill” agreement in which a tabloid buys a story only to bury it. Mr. Trump is a friend of A.M.I.’s chairman, David J. Pecker. Ms. McDougal filed suit earlier this week to get out of her deal with American Media, saying she signed it under pressure and false pretenses, effectively silencing her on the affair. (American Media has denied her claims, saying over the past couple of days that the contract is valid, it was not trying to silence her, and indicating the story “may be published” just yet). Many of the details Ms. McDougal shared in her interview with Mr. Cooper were included in a piece in The New Yorker magazine last month, based on handwritten notes she took about the relationship. But an in-person, television interview is uniquely visceral, and Ms. McDougal’s appearance was clearly of a sort Mr. Trump’s allies would have wanted to avoid during the campaign. On Sunday, “60 Minutes’’ is planning to show an interview by Mr. Cooper with another woman who is suing to get out of a deal restricting her from speaking about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump, the adult entertainment star Stephanie Clifford. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied that he had an affair with either of the two women. Composed, unwavering, yet sometimes tearful, Ms. McDougal told a detailed story about a relationship that was based on love — “he always told me he loved me,” she said — and was facilitated by one of Mr. Trump’s bodyguards. She described herself as a Republican and said she voted for Mr. Trump in November, describing him as “brilliant” and “charming” and someone she loved enough to even consider marrying. She said she was now eager to tell her story because it was already known and she wanted the chance to tell it herself. Ms. McDougal said she first met Mr. Trump when he filmed an episode of “Celebrity Apprentice” at the Playboy Mansion in 2006, where they struck up conversation and he asked for her number. She said they had their first date that June, on Mr. Trump’s birthday, at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Mr. Trump invited her for dinner, she said, so she was surprised when they entered the grounds from a rear entrance and went directly to a private bungalow. “We’re talking about his birthday, and then as the night ended, we were intimate,” she said. What followed, she said, were dozens of dates and sexual encounters in which, she said in answer to a specific question from Mr. Cooper, Mr. Trump did not use birth control. Many of those encounters, she said, took place at the Beverly Hills Hotel, but she also spent time with Mr. Trump at his other properties across the country. “I went to his golf course in California,” she said. “I went to his golf course home in New Jersey. I went to his home in New York.” At one party, she met his son Eric, and posed with him in a picture, she said. At another, at the Playboy Mansion, she posed for a picture with Mr. Trump, Melania Trump, Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and other people, keeping her distance from Mrs. Trump as best she could, she said. Ms. McDougal said Mr. Trump had compared her, favorably, to his daughter. “He said I was beautiful like her and, ‘You’re a smart girl,’” she said. Once, she said, she was even whisked to his apartment at Trump Tower, when Mrs. Trump and Barron were not home. “I said, ‘Aren’t you afraid to bring me here?’ He’s like, ‘They won’t say anything,’” she said. While he gave her a tour, she said, “we passed a room and he said this is Melania’s room she likes to have her alone time.” But, she said, being in the apartment, “just puts a little stab in your heart,” and she could not wait to leave. An unbearably guilty conscience prompted her to finally end the relationship in 2007. Ms. McDougal said she was “disgusted” by the hot-mic “Access Hollywood” tape recording that came out late in the presidential campaign in which Mr. Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, just as she was “mortified” when more than a dozen women leveled sexual misconduct allegations at him. “I’ve never seen that side of him,” she said. Asked about denials Mr. Trump’s representatives have issued about her allegations of an affair, Ms. McDougal said, “I think somebody’s lying, and I can tell you it’s not me.” An earlier version of this article, using a preliminary transcript, misquoted part of a comment by Karen McDougal. She said that after she had been intimate with Donald Trump for the first time, “he tried to pay me; and actually I didn’t know how to take that.” She did not say, “I actually did not take that.”",The New York Times
2018,Ex-Playboy Model Karen McDougal Sues to Speak on Alleged Trump Affair,"A former Playboy model who claimed she had an affair with Donald J. Trump sued on Tuesday to be released from a 2016 legal agreement restricting her ability to speak, becoming the second woman this month to challenge Trump allies’ efforts during the presidential campaign to bury stories about extramarital relationships. (Read the complaint.) The model, Karen McDougal, is suing The National Enquirer’s parent company, which paid her $150,000 and whose chief executive is a friend of President Trump’s. The other woman, the adult entertainment star Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, was paid $130,000 to stay quiet by the president’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. She filed a lawsuit earlier this month. Both women, who argue that their contracts are invalid, are trying to get around clauses requiring them to resolve disputes in secretive arbitration proceedings rather than in open court. Mr. Trump has denied the affairs, which both women have described as consensual. In other potential legal trouble for the president, a Manhattan judge on Tuesday denied a move by Mr. Trump’s lawyers to block a defamation suit from Summer Zervos, a former “Apprentice” contestant. She accused Mr. Trump of sexually harassing her after she appeared on his reality show. He has called her and over a dozen other women who accused him of harassment “liars.” The decision can allow lawyers to subpoena documents and call on other women to testify in depositions. The judge, Jennifer G. Schecter, cited the Paula Jones harassment case that led to Bill Clinton’s impeachment and said, “It is settled that the president of the United States has no immunity and is ‘subject to the laws’ for purely private acts.” Ms. McDougal, in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims that Mr. Cohen was secretly involved in her talks with the tabloid company, American Media Inc., and that A.M.I. and her lawyer at the time misled her about the deal. She also asserts that after she spoke last month with The New Yorker, which obtained notes she kept on Mr. Trump, A.M.I. warned that “any further disclosures would breach Karen’s contract” and “cause considerable monetary damages.” In an email to The New York Times, her new lawyer, Peter K. Stris, accused A.M.I. of “a multifaceted effort to silence Karen McDougal.” “The lawsuit filed today aims to restore her right to her own voice,” he said, adding, “We intend to invalidate the so-called contract that American Media Inc. imposed on Karen so she can move forward with the private life she deserves.” Shortly after Ms. McDougal filed her suit, CNN announced that she would sit for an interview with Anderson Cooper on Thursday. Ms. Clifford was to appear on “60 Minutes” three days later to discuss her relationship with Mr. Trump and the efforts Mr. Cohen undertook on his client’s behalf to pay for her silence. Mr. Trump joined a legal effort last week seeking some $20 million in penalties tied to Ms. Clifford’s agreement. The court dispute has drawn public attention to an issue that was previously sidelined. And both women’s suits could provide more fodder for federal complaints from the watchdog group Common Cause that the payoffs were, effectively, illegal campaign contributions. Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal tell strikingly similar stories about their experiences with Mr. Trump, which included alleged trysts at the same Lake Tahoe golf tournament in 2006, dates at the same Beverly Hills hotel and promises of apartments as gifts. Their stories first surfaced in the The Wall Street Journal four days before the election, but got little traction in the swirl of news that followed Mr. Trump’s victory. The women even shared the same Los Angeles lawyer, Keith Davidson, who has long worked for clients who sell their stories to the tabloids. Ms. McDougal negotiated with the country’s leading tabloid news provider, A.M.I., which is known to buy and bury stories that might damage allies of its chief executive, David J. Pecker — a practice known as “catch and kill.” Ms. McDougal’s legal complaint alleges that she did not know about the practice, or about Mr. Pecker’s friendship with Mr. Trump, when she began talking to company representatives, shortly after Mr. Trump locked up the Republican nomination. A.M.I. has previously acknowledged that Mr. Trump had been friends with Mr. Pecker, but said that he had never tried to influence coverage at the company’s publications. In a statement on Tuesday, A.M.I. said that its contract with Ms. McDougal was valid and that it looked forward “to reaching an amicable resolution.” It added that while she had given the company “editorial discretion to publish her life story,” she had been “free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with President Trump since 2016.” A.M.I. amended her contract after the election, allowing her to answer “legitimate” questions from the press. But the lawsuit contends that the parameters were unclear to her, and her lawyers argue that A.M.I. can continue to control her responses. Ms. McDougal has said that she was ambivalent about selling her story on the tabloid news market, but felt that her hand was forced after a hint of the alleged affair appeared in May 2016 on social media. Convinced something more would come out, she was determined to tell her story on her terms, her suit says. A mutual friend connected her to Mr. Davidson, who, she said, told her the story could be worth millions. He arranged an interview with Dylan Howard, A.M.I.’s chief content officer, in Los Angeles. Mr. Davidson told her before the interview that A.M.I. would put $500,000 in an escrow account for her, and that “a seven-figure publishing contract awaited her,” the complaint reads. Mr. Howard spent several hours pressing Ms. McDougal on the details of her story. But several days later, the media company declined to buy it, the complaint reads, and “Mr. Davidson revealed that, in fact, there was no money in escrow.” A spokesman for Mr. Davidson said on Tuesday that the lawyer “fulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal to accomplish her stated goals at that time,” but that commenting further would “violate attorney-client privilege.” A.M.I. told The Times last month that it decided not to print Ms. McDougal’s story because it could not verify important details, though it acknowledged discussing her allegations with Mr. Cohen, the president’s lawyer, saying it did so as part of its reporting process. The tabloid company showed renewed interest in the story in summer 2016, when Ms. McDougal began talks with ABC News. This time, A.M.I. offered a different deal. Mr. Davidson informed her that A.M.I. would buy her story but not publish it because of Mr. Pecker’s relationship with Mr. Trump, the suit says. The payment would be $150,000, with Mr. Davidson and others involved on her behalf taking 45 percent. More alluring to Ms. McDougal, who is now a fitness specialist, was that the media company would feature her on its covers and in regular health and fitness columns, the complaint says. As A.M.I. and Mr. Davidson pushed her to sign the deal on Aug. 5, Ms. McDougal expressed misgivings. But, her suit says, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Howard argued in an urgent Skype call that the deal to promote her would “kick start and revitalize” her career, given that she was “old now.” She was 45. In all, they said, the contract would obligate A.M.I. to run more than 100 columns or articles and at least two covers featuring her. When she asked Mr. Davidson what she should do if her story leaked, he responded in an email, “IF YOU DENY YOU ARE SAFE,” and urged her to sign as soon as possible, according to the court documents. The Times reported last month that Mr. Davidson sent Mr. Cohen an email on Aug. 5, 2016, asking him to call. Mr. Davidson then told Mr. Cohen over the phone that the deal had been completed, according to a person familiar with the conversation. The timeline provided in the lawsuit shows that Mr. Davidson’s email came as he and A.M.I. were still hashing out the terms of the deal, which Ms. McDougal did not sign until the following day, Aug. 6. Mr. Cohen told The Times last month that he did not recall the communications. After signing the contract, Ms. McDougal grew frustrated when she did not hear about columns or cover shoots for several weeks. She later figured out why. Though the agreement explicitly mentioned “a monthly column” on aging and fitness for OK! and Star, and “four posts each month” on Radar Online, it only gave A.M.I. “the right” to print them. It was not an obligation. “She was tricked into signing it while being misled as to its contents (including by her own lawyer, on whose advice she was entitled to rely),” the lawsuit reads. So far, A.M.I. has run one cover and roughly two dozen columns or posts featuring her. The company said that it had been trying to schedule a photo shoot for another cover but implied that Ms. McDougal felt she had not been paid enough. Her legal team denied that she was seeking more money. Mr. Stris contends that his client was misled and that the contract was executed under fraudulent circumstances, giving her the right to sue in court rather than proceed in arbitration.",The New York Times
2018,Ex-Russian Spy ‘Stable’ After Nerve Agent Attack in U.K.,"LONDON — The former Russian spy Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, remain unconscious and are in critical but stable condition, Britain’s home secretary, Amber Rudd, told lawmakers on Thursday, adding that it was too early to apportion blame for a “brazen and reckless” attack involving a nerve agent. A police officer who assisted the two victims, and was also hospitalized, is in serious but stable condition and is “conscious, talking and engaging,” Ms. Rudd added, in an update on an investigation that has stirred much speculation about Russian involvement. In a police statement, the officer was identified as Nick Bailey, a detective sergeant. While she described the incident as an “attempted murder in the most cruel and public way,” Ms. Rudd said she would refrain from attributing blame until the hundreds of antiterrorism police and security officials working the case reached conclusions based on solid evidence. “There will come a time for attribution,” Ms. Rudd said, promising that there would be “consequences” for those behind the attempt on the life of Mr. Skripal and his daughter, who were taken ill on Sunday afternoon in the city of Salisbury. In 2006, a Russian court convicted Mr. Skripal, a former colonel in Russia’s military intelligence arm, of selling secrets to the British. He was released in 2010 and sent to Britain as part of an exchange of spies. Inevitably, the incident has revived memories of the murder in London of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former Russian spy and critic of President Vladimir V. Putin who died in November 2006, aged 43, after ingesting polonium 210, a rare radioactive isotope. That episode caused an international outcry and led to years of tension between Britain and Russia, though several British lawmakers have suggested that the government in London did not take tough enough measures against Moscow. It was not until 2016 that an official inquiry finally linked the killing to the Kremlin. On Thursday, one Conservative lawmaker, Edward Leigh, said that circumstantial evidence that Russia was behind the Salisbury attack was strong and that, if its role were proved, it would be a “brazen act of war.” An opposition Labour Party lawmaker, Ben Bradshaw, referred to the “terrorist Russian state.” On Wednesday Mark Rowley, Britain’s chief police official for counterterrorism and international security, said that Mr. Skripal, 66, and Ms. Skripal, 33, “were targeted specifically,” but did not say what kind of nerve agent was used, or even whether investigators had identified it. On Thursday, the Wiltshire Police said that 21 people in all had been treated as a result of the nerve gas poisoning in Salisbury. If the British government does ultimately attribute the attack to Russian state actors, the use of a nerve agent would suggest a significant statement was being made to other potential targets. The Russian government has denied involvement, and on Wednesday the Russian embassy in London described warnings of potential British retaliation as “a testament of London’s growing unpredictability as a partner in international relations,” adding that British policy toward Russia was “inconsistent and looks rather miscalculated, not least in the eyes of the Russian public.” The Russian news media had mostly ignored the nerve agent attack, until the evening news on Wednesday on the government-controlled Channel One, when the host issued a lightly veiled threat to those like Mr. Skripal who had “betrayed the motherland.” “Being a traitor is one of the most dangerous professions in the world,” the host, Kirill Kleimenov, said, adding that the stress could be so severe as to turn a person’s hair white. “Alcoholism, drugs, stress, nervous breakdowns and depression are inevitable illnesses of a traitor,” he said. “As a consequence — heart attacks, strokes, traffic accidents, suicides, ultimately.” In an apparent attempt at humor, he also said that Mr. Skripal’s fate might have something to do with living in England, a place that has become home to hundreds of thousands of Russians, some of whom left to escape life — and sometimes death — under the government of Mr. Putin. Whether you are a professional traitor or just hate Russia, Mr. Kleimenov said, “Don’t go to England. There is something wrong there. Maybe the climate.” Wednesday’s edition of Moskovsky Komsomolets, a Russian tabloid, quoted an anonymous intelligence officer as saying that Mr. Skripal was no longer of interest to Russia’s security services, and blaming the incident on the British. “What has happened is only in their interest. But with the poisoning they really put their foot in it, they acted too traditionally. Anyone who has studied history knows that it’s precisely the Brits who are champions in poisoning,” the officer was quoted as saying.",The New York Times
2018,Ex-Trump Aide Sam Nunberg Says He Will Refuse Grand Jury Order. Unless He Doesn’t.,"WASHINGTON — It began with a subpoena. It ended with a question about whether its recipient was drunk on live television. Sam Nunberg, a onetime Trump campaign aide who recently met with investigators for the special counsel, set cable news alight on Monday when he declared that he was subpoenaed to go before a grand jury on Friday, but that he was unlikely to appear or to provide documents he was ordered to hand over. He indicated he did not know what the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was seeking by ordering him to appear before the grand jury and to turn over a number of documents. There was no way to authenticate the subpoena; Mr. Mueller’s office declined to comment. But Mr. Nunberg said he was unconcerned about the potential for being arrested. By midafternoon, he had been interviewed on MSNBC and CNN. Fox News soon joined in with coverage. On air, Mr. Nunberg denigrated Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, as a “slob.” Twitter cataloged his insults, mesmerized by his repeat performances. One CNN host asked him if he had been drinking. By evening, Mr. Nunberg told reporters he might comply with Mr. Mueller’s demand after all. Unless he doesn’t, of course. And so it went with Mr. Nunberg, a protégé of the self-described dirty trickster Roger J. Stone Jr., who has been a focus of aspects of the various investigations into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Part of the subpoena document, which Mr. Nunberg provided to The New York Times, is dated Feb. 27 and makes no mention of requiring him to appear before the grand jury. It calls only for him to preserve documents from Nov. 1, 2015, through the present related to several people connected to the Trump campaign. They include President Trump; the departing White House communications director, Hope Hicks; the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist; Mr. Trump’s longtime bodyguard, Keith Schiller; the former Trump Organization lawyer Michael D. Cohen; and Mr. Stone, a longtime confidant of Mr. Trump’s. “They have requested a ridiculous amount of documents,” Mr. Nunberg said. “Should I spend 30 hours producing these? I don’t know what they have. They may very well have something on the president. But they are unfairly targeting Roger Stone.” The subpoena also demands any documents related to Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who was secretly surveilled by the Justice Department as part of the Russia investigation, as well as Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, and his deputy, Rick Gates. Mr. Manafort has been indicted on a string of money laundering and fraud charges, and Mr. Gates recently pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller’s investigators. The list of people about whom Mr. Mueller is seeking information from Mr. Nunberg raises questions about his target, as does the time frame. Mr. Nunberg was fired by Mr. Trump during the summer of 2015 and thus was gone from the campaign in November. And he and Mr. Lewandowski are known to be combatants. Still, Mr. Nunberg — whose mentor, Mr. Stone, goes by the motto that all press is good press — spent hours on Monday engaged in a media tour with The Times, The Washington Post, CNN and MSNBC, describing his plans to flout the subpoena and professing his lack of concern about what could happen to him. “I was fired within six weeks” of the campaign’s start, Mr. Nunberg told The Times, despite having “saved” Mr. Trump during a fight with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that summer after Mr. Trump’s remark that Mr. McCain was not a war hero because he was captured in Vietnam. Mr. McCain was shot down during the war and imprisoned for more than five years in Hanoi, refusing early release even after being beaten repeatedly. Mr. Nunberg added that the president often sounded “like a moron, but this whole thing is a witch hunt.” Mr. Nunberg said he anticipated his lawyer, Patrick J. Brackley, would fire him for speaking publicly. Mr. Brackley did not immediately respond to an email asking whether that was the case. Mr. Nunberg could avoid appearing before the grand jury if his lawyer sent prosecutors a letter asserting his Fifth Amendment rights not to incriminate himself. If that does not happen, Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors could ask a judge for a bench warrant for Mr. Nunberg’s arrest. Mr. Nunberg has spoken with the Senate Intelligence Committee in its own investigation into Russian election meddling, according to a person familiar with the matter. He has not spoken with the House Intelligence Committee, according to three of its members. Its own examination of Moscow interference has languished amid partisan infighting. Mr. Stone, asked for comment, said he was not surprised that his information was being sought. “I was part of the Trump campaign, have been the president’s friend and adviser for decades, and would expect that Mueller’s team would ask for any documents or emails sent or written by me,” Mr. Stone said in a text message. “But let me reiterate, I have no knowledge or involvement in Russian collusion or any other inappropriate act.”",The New York Times
2018,Executive Who Sold Self-Driving Truck Start-Up to Uber Departs,"SAN FRANCISCO — One of the founders of Otto, a self-driving truck company founded by former Google employees and acquired by Uber, has left the ride-hailing service. Lior Ron — who along with Anthony Levandowski sold Otto to Uber in 2016, six months after leaving Google — was in charge of Uber Freight, a truck shipment booking service. Most of Uber Freight’s business does not involve the company’s autonomous trucks. The departure followed a fatal crash involving an Uber self-driving car in Tempe, Ariz. The police said the car, driving in autonomous mode, had failed to slow down before it struck and killed a woman who was walking her bicycle across a street. Uber has stopped testing of its autonomous vehicles in Arizona, California, Pittsburgh and Toronto while investigators look into the accident. A week after Uber halted testing, Arizona’s governor ordered the company’s self-driving cars off state roads. Uber also pulled an application to renew its permit for testing autonomous vehicles in California. CNBC reported Mr. Ron’s departure earlier on Wednesday. An Uber spokesman, Matt Kallman, said the departure was unrelated to the Tempe crash, but he would not elaborate on why Mr. Ron had left or on the timing. Uber executives have said self-driving car technology is a key to the company’s future. But the effort had become a headache long before the crash in Arizona. The company’s cars were struggling to meet internal development expectations and falling way behind the improvements made by competitors. Otto became the centerpiece of an intellectual property lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google. Waymo had accused Uber of conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal important technology plans. Mr. Ron, who is not an engineer but has a background in business development, was a prominent figure in the lawsuit. His name came up repeatedly in evidence presented by Waymo to support its case that Mr. Levandowski — one of the engineers who helped start Google’s driverless car project — stole trade secrets. Uber fired Mr. Levandowski in May when he refused to cooperate with its case against Waymo. Uber and Waymo settled the case last month. While Uber’s autonomous vehicle testing has been stopped at least temporarily, Waymo is embarking on an ambitious expansion of its operation. The company said it would buy up to 20,000 electric cars from Jaguar Land Rover for its driverless ride service.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Exit Tillerson at State,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Tillerson Out After Rocky Tenure at State; Pompeo to Replace Him” (nytimes.com, March 13): Are we supposed to believe that Rex Tillerson’s firing has nothing to do with his criticism of Russia over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain? This only serves to emphasize the need for a further investigation into Trump-Russia ties. In a way, the Trump presidency has become a test to answer several questions. How gullible are the American people? How many of its principles will the Republicans jettison to keep power? How long can a corrupt incompetent cling to power? The answers are already disturbing, but we apparently have not plumbed the depths yet. HOWARD SCHMITT, GREEN TREE, PA. To the Editor: President Trump, in firing his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said Mr. Tillerson’s views were too far from his own. It makes one wonder what was looked at when Mr. Tillerson was vetted for the job, and what was discussed when Mr. Trump interviewed him. ROBERT WEISS, MILL VALLEY, CALIF.",The New York Times
2018,"Expelling Diplomats, a Furious Kremlin Escalates a Crisis","MOSCOW — Russia on Thursday escalated a confrontation with Europe and the United States over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, saying it would expel 60 American diplomats and an unspecified number of envoys from other countries to retaliate for a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats working in the West and beyond that was ordered this week. Furious at what it described as an anti-Russian campaign orchestrated by Washington and London, the Kremlin exceeded an equivalent response to the United States and ordered the closing of the American Consulate in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city. The consulate is bigger and far more important to relations than the Russian Consulate in Seattle, which the Trump administration ordered closed on Monday as part of its expulsion decree. The crisis over the March 4 poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter has driven tensions between the Kremlin and the West to their highest pitch in decades and forced European countries like Germany that are usually wary of clashing with Moscow to choose sides. Britain contends that the poison used was a signature Russian nerve agent created by Soviet-era scientists. Voicing alarm that the East-West confrontation was spinning out of control, the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, said that the crisis recalled the Cold War, only without the controls and channels of communication established before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union “to make sure things would not get out of control when tensions rise.” The intensifying crisis has also put new pressure on President Trump. He has been loath to criticize Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and, against the advice of his advisers, he avoided any mention of the March 4 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England, when he telephoned Mr. Putin to congratulate him on his lopsided victory in Russia’s March 18 election. Following his practice of avoiding public criticism of Russia, Mr. Trump made no mention of the expulsions during a speech on Thursday afternoon in Ohio. Hours later the White House issued a muted response, calling the Kremlin actions “a further deterioration” in United States-Russia relations. “The expulsion of undeclared Russian intelligence officers by the United States and more than two dozen partner nations and NATO allies earlier this week was an appropriate response to the Russian attack on the soil of the United Kingdom,” the White House said in a statement. “Russia’s response was not unanticipated, and the United States will deal with it.” In a sign that Russia’s political elite still retains hope that President Trump wants to take a softer line on Moscow, Vladimir Dzhabarov, deputy chairman of the international affairs committee in Russia’s upper house of Parliament, told the Interfax news agency on Thursday that Mr. Trump had been forced to expel Russian diplomats on Monday under “pressure” from unidentified foes of the Kremlin who were angry that he had congratulated Mr. Putin. Russian politicians and state-controlled media outlets have long clung to the idea that Mr. Trump is Moscow’s friend and would like to improve relations but has been pressured into taking a tough line by what they describe as America’s “deep state,” a supposed network of hidden powers hostile to Russia and often loyal to former administrations. This resilient trust in Mr. Trump, however, has been severely undermined by the American decision to rally behind British accusations that Russia was to blame for the nerve agent attack on Sergei V. Skripal, a former military intelligence officer who spied for Britain, and his daughter, Yulia. The Russians also are angry over Washington’s role in mobilizing a broad coalition of European and other countries in support of Britain. In all, 27 countries are ejecting more than 150 Russians, including people listed by their embassies and consulates as diplomats, and military and cultural attachés. Western officials say that many of the Russians are spies and that the expulsions will hinder Russian espionage. Britain’s national security adviser, Mark Sedwill, who was visiting Washington on Thursday as the Russian expulsion order was announced, called it a response to a powerful Western message: That for the first time the United States and two dozen other nations would “act together to respond to a range of aggressive Russian behavior.” Wary of picking a fight with the whole of Europe, however, Russia has focused its fury on London and Washington, accusing them of strong-arming allies to endorse what it insists are unfounded accusations of Russian involvement in the attack on the Skripals. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it would make a “mirror” response to expulsions by Germany, France and other countries that expelled a small number of Russian diplomats, suggesting equivalent expulsions of diplomats from European countries, Australia and other nations that ordered out Russian envoys on Monday. But Moscow avoided denouncing those countries and instead accused the American authorities of “encouraging and fomenting a slander campaign against our country.” In a statement, the ministry demanded that they “stop their reckless actions aimed at ruining bilateral relations.” In remarks on Russian television on Thursday evening, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, scoffed at accusations of a Russian role in the Salisbury attack as “unprecedented impudence” and said Western actions amounted to “gangsterism in international affairs.” Mr. Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who was imprisoned in Russia for selling secrets to the British, was sent to Britain in 2010 as part of a spy swap. Why he would be targeted years later is unclear, but political and security analysts have said that the attack was a warning to those who would cross Mr. Putin that, even in exile, they are never beyond the Kremlin’s reach. Relations between Russia and the West were already rocky over Moscow’s roles in the wars in Syria and Ukraine, Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, its meddling in elections in the United States and elsewhere, the assassination of Kremlin foes in Russia and abroad, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against other countries and what Western officials have described as a broad, largely covert effort to destabilize and discredit liberal democracies. Mr. Putin last year ordered the United States Embassy in Moscow to reduce its staff by 755 employees, mostly Russians working as guards, drivers and in other support jobs, after Congress ordered sweeping sanctions against Russia to punish it for meddling in the American election. Russia’s decision on Thursday to evict 60 American diplomats will further strain the American Embassy’s already reduced operations, making it even more difficult to process visas and watch over economic relations and other matters on which Russia and Washington still sometimes collaborate. The Russian retaliation is also likely to hurt Western espionage capabilities in Russia. The United States and its allies also use diplomatic covers for their spies. While relations were already strained, the nerve agent attack in Salisbury has frayed tempers so severely that mistrust between Moscow and the West has now spiked to a level not seen since a Soviet warplane shot down a Korean Airlines passenger jet from New York to Seoul in 1983. Soviet officials initially denied any role in downing the plane. In often angry comments at a press briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Ministry’s spokesman, Maria Zakharova, said Britain had no evidence to support its accusations against Russia and compared them to a Nazi campaign to blame the Soviet Union for a 1933 fire at the German Parliament. The fire, exploited by the Nazis to rally support, played a crucial role in Hitler’s rise to power. Ms. Zakharova said Washington and Britain had dragooned unwilling countries into their “anti-Russian campaign” through pressure and favors, which she did not detail. Her remarks seemed aimed at containing the diplomatic crisis to Russia’s relations with London and Washington, the pillars of a trans-Atlantic alliance that Moscow, since the Cold War era, has accused of harboring a particular animus against Russia. The Kremlin’s actions also signaled to the Russian public that their country was not at odds with the whole of Europe, which would be an alarming prospect for millions of Russians who travel each year to countries like France and Germany. The closing of the consulate in St. Petersburg will please Russians and others who responded to an opinion poll conducted by the Russian Embassy in Washington. The embassy invited people following its Twitter account to vote for which American consulate Moscow should close in response to the closing of Russia’s Seattle consulate, and St. Petersburg was by far the favorite choice. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and her government contend that Mr. Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with one of an extremely powerful class of nerve agents known as Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the 1970s and ’80s. The British say they have solid evidence that Russia was probably behind the attack, and that Mr. Putin himself probably approved it. The Skripals were found unconscious in a busy shopping area in Salisbury, where Mr. Skripal lives. He remains hospitalized in critical condition, but his daughter is showing improvement, British officials announced on Thursday. British officials say that hundreds of people could have been exposed to the nerve agent used against the Skripals. Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said Thursday that Russia had called for a meeting next Tuesday of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to “establish the truth” with respect to what Russia refers to as “the so-called Skripal case.”",The New York Times
2018,"Expelling Russians, Europe and North America Show Unity With U.K.","LONDON — European nations united in a rare coordinated rebuke of Russia on Monday, joining the United States and Canada in expelling scores of Russian diplomats. The expulsions, which were denounced by the Kremlin, were a show of solidarity with their ally Britain, which has accused the Kremlin of being behind the use of a nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy and his daughter. By Monday evening, 16 European Union member nations said they were expelling dozens of Russian diplomats in solidarity with the government of Britain, which two weeks ago ejected 23 Russian diplomats who it said were engaged in espionage. Ukraine, which is not part of the European Union but is fighting a Moscow-backed insurgency in its east, said it was expelling 13 Russians. Albania, Macedonia and Norway, which also are not members of the bloc, also expelled Russian diplomats. Together with the expulsion on Monday of 60 Russians by the United States and four by Canada, the European moves constituted a broad swipe at Russia’s diplomatic capabilities and — if Western assertions about the nature of Russian intelligence are correct — at its ability to conduct spying operations. It also demonstrated remarkable European unity behind Britain, at a time when Britain’s pending exit from the European Union and other tensions have been threatening the continent’s cohesion. The British government has asserted that the Russian government is responsible for the chemical weapon attack on Sergei V. Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, and that President Vladimir V. Putin may have been personally culpable. The Skripals, who remain hospitalized in intensive care, were poisoned on March 4 in Salisbury, where Mr. Skripal lives, in an attack that endangered hundreds of people who came near them. “The world’s patience is rather wearing thin with President Putin and his actions, and the fact that right across the NATO alliance, right across the European Union, nations have stood up in support of the United Kingdom,” the British defense secretary, Gavin Williamson, said on a visit to Estonia, which expelled two Russian diplomats. He said of the expulsions, “I actually think that is the very best response that we could have.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry expressed its “strong protest” over the expulsions. “We consider this as an unfriendly step that is not consistent with the goals and interests of establishing the underlying reasons and searching for the perpetrators of the incident that occurred in the town of Salisbury on March 4,” the ministry said in a statement distributed on social media. “The provocative gesture of the so-called solidarity of these countries with London, which blindly followed the British authorities in the so-called ‘Skripal case,’ and which never got around to sort out the circumstances of the incident, is a continuation of the confrontational policy to escalate the situation,” the statement said. Jacek Czaputowicz, the foreign minister of Poland, which expelled four Russians, called the poisoning of the Skripals an “unprecedented attack on civilians with the use of chemical weapon, unseen in Europe since World War II.” Russia’s overall goal, he said, is to “disrupt international order and create a sense of danger.” He said four Russian diplomats were now considered “persona non grata,” giving them until April 3 to leave the country. Of the European Union members that expelled Russian diplomats, Germany, France and Poland each ordered four Russian officials out of their countries; Lithuania and the Czech Republic three each; Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands two each; and Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Romania, Spain, Hungary and Sweden one each. “The nerve agent attack represents a clear threat to the rules-based international order and to the rules that were established by the international community to ensure chemical weapons would never again destroy human lives,” said Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister. “This is part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behavior by Russia, including complicity with the Assad regime, the annexation of Crimea, Russian-led fighting in eastern Ukraine, support for civil strife in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other neighboring countries, interference in elections and disinformation campaigns.” The Belgian government said it would discuss on Tuesday whether to expel any of the Russian diplomats who handle relations not only with Belgium, but also with the European Union and NATO, which have their headquarters in Brussels, said Barend Leyts, spokesman for the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel. “In Belgium, the situation is a bit more complex than in other countries, because of the international institutions located in Brussels,” Mr. Leyts said. “We want a coordinated response, and the point will be discussed by the cabinet tomorrow.” Romania’s Foreign Affairs Ministry released a statement calling the Salisbury attack “a threat to our collective security and international law.” It said the European Council “agrees with the U.K. government’s assessment that the Russian Federation is most likely to be responsible for the attack and that there is no other plausible explanation.” Anthony Glees, the director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham in England, said such expulsions would hurt Russia by limiting its intelligence gathering capabilities. Unlike with expulsions in Soviet times, the Russians no longer have Eastern European allies who can carry on the work for them, particularly in Britain. “There are no surrogates this time around,” Mr. Glees said. “The Germans are on our side, the Czechs are on our side.” Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, an international political risk consulting firm, wrote on Twitter that the Trump administration’s expulsion of 60 Russians and closing of the Russian consulate in Seattle was “a bigger move” than what the Europeans were doing. “Getting harder to say Trump’s treating Putin with kid gloves,” he added. The Polish counterintelligence agency also announced the arrest of a man it accused of spying for Russia and passing along information about sensitive energy projects. Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesman for the minister of secret services, said the man, identified only as Marek W., was employed “overseeing the economic investments in Poland” and “gathering funds for diversification of gas supplies for Poland.” “He had access to information crucial for Poland’s energy projects,” Mr. Zaryn said on state television. Marek W. was arrested on Friday and, if found guilty, could serve up to 10 years in prison. Europe is heavily dependent on Russian gas imports, and Poland has been trying to diversify that supply — a delicate issue for both countries. Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian energy giant, wants to build a major gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, from Russia to Germany, bypassing Poland — and Poland has been leading efforts to derail the project.",The New York Times
2018,Experimenting With Sound and Story: Teaching and Learning With ‘The Daily’ Podcast,"Shortly after the inauguration of Donald Trump, at a particularly turbulent and divisive moment in American politics, The New York Times launched “The Daily.” The free, roughly 20-minute podcast posts every weekday at 6 a.m. Eastern, and provides in-depth analysis of key news events in a compelling, distinctive format. Hosted by the former New York Times political reporter Michael Barbaro, the show arms listeners with clarity and context for confronting the often-chaotic onslaught of news we’re bombarded with every day, and has been downloaded millions of times by listeners across the country. The show features engaging interviews with journalists from The Times on the front lines of major developments. These reporters are uniquely qualified to objectively explain the multifaceted nature of the stories they cover, and to guide listeners through the complex historical context crucial to understanding how we got here in the first place. As Mr. Barbaro says in a Times Insider piece about the origins of the podcast, “The whole point of the show was to disentangle and to explain this extraordinarily consequential and incredibly difficult-to-understand moment in our history.” Teaching with ”The Daily” can be a great way to bring Times reporters and the stories they cover into your classroom. The show offers a regular source of boiled-down news analysis and powerful storytelling, addressing a broad swath of national and international issues that can provoke student discussion and further investigation into the complex nuances of an issue and the history that shaped it. Keep in mind that most students are probably not accustomed to listening to long chunks of spoken word audio without any visual aids, and it may initially be challenging to capture their attention as easily as a video might. You can help prepare them for the experience by having them first read and discuss one of The Times articles related to the podcast episode, which you can find linked from each episode. It may also sometimes make more sense to just play samples of an episode rather than all 20 minutes of it. Or, consult our lesson plan Active Listening: Using Times Videos, Podcasts and Articles to Practice a Key Skill for even more ideas. Below, we explore two shows in depth, suggest five ways you can teach with any episode, and list seven more episodes we especially recommend for classrooms. How do you teach with podcasts in general, or “The Daily” in particular? Let us know in the comments. _________ In addition to in-studio interviews, some episodes of “The Daily” also follow reporters in the field, capturing the voices of the main characters of a story and introducing listeners to the places they come from. The long-form narrative format results in vivid accounts focused squarely on the people behind the headlines, those individuals and communities most impacted by a particular issue but often overlooked in the broader conversation. The two episodes below introduce students to these different types of shows — the first a field production, and the second a more standard interview. We have suggested places to pause and questions to ask at those points. You can put those questions on a handout, write them on the board, or just ask them aloud as students write. 1. Revisiting Carlos’s Secret (22:00) This episode revisits an article from February 2017 about a largely white working-class town in Southern Illinois that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, and how residents react when a well-respected member of the community is detained by federal immigration authorities. The podcast follows Monica Davey, The Times’s Chicago bureau chief, as she explores the many factors at play in this poignant story. Before playing the podcast, have students read this related story. Then start the podcast at the beginning. Pause at: 2:34 What are the politics of the town and why have they changed in recent years? Which presidential candidate did that region support? Why? Pause at 8:30 How has immigration policy changed in the U.S. since Mr. Trump became president? Who is Carlos and what’s his reputation around town? What happened to him after the presidential election? Pause at 17:40 What’s the complicating factor in Carlos’s record? How did the town react to his detention? Did the experience change the political positions of people in the town? Pause at 22:00 What is Carlos’s current situation now? Why does he say he can’t go back to where he’s from in Mexico? Why does he feel as if it’s important to be part an active part of his community, even if he’s not a legal resident there? Discussion questions after students have listened: What are some key takeaways from this story? What caught your attention? Can you think of an example when your personal feelings about something conflicted with a general principle or political position you have? Where do you stand on this story? What should happen to Carlos and why? Should he get any special treatment? Does this story make you think any differently about the different sides of the immigration debate? Does it make you feel any more sympathetic to the views of people you might not agree with? Did you find this story engaging and fairly told? What did you like and what would have made it better? 2. The Tax Bill and Trickle-Down Economics (15:08) Although taxes are perhaps not the most natural topic for teenagers, this episode from November is a great example of an engaging analysis that helps illuminate a dense but important issue. In it, Michael Barbaro interviews Peter S. Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times who discusses the trickle-down or supply-side economic theory at the heart of the Republican tax bill, and examines its questionable track record. Before playing the podcast, have students read this related article, then start the podcast at the beginning. Pause at 4:04 What’s the basic idea behind supply-side or trickle-down economics? What’s the deal with the horse and sparrow theory? Which presidents promoted trickle-down tax reform? How did they sell it? What promises did they make? Pause at 6:12 How has this strategy actually played out? What evidence does Mr. Goodman cite to support this? What’s the consensus among most mainstream economists? Pause at 10:42 What’s in the current tax bill? What does it do (based on the initial House version discussed)? What do House Speaker Paul Ryan and his Republican colleagues give as reasons that this tax plan will prompt U.S. businesses to create more jobs? Why does Mr. Goodman so strongly dispute this line of thinking? What does he predict will actually happen? End at 15:08 Despite its poor track record, why does cutting taxes continue to be an easy idea to sell to the public and why does the proposal keep coming up over and over again? Discussion questions after students have listened: What are some key takeaways from this interview? What caught your attention? What are the main arguments for and against cutting taxes? After hearing this interview, where do you stand? And do you think your current views might change once you enter the work force and have to start supporting yourself? Can you think of any holes in Mr. Goodman’s analysis? Is he remaining objective? What are some other examples of well-known theories (either in government or popular culture) that keep being introduced even though they’ve never proved successful? Did you find this interview interesting? What did you like about it? What could have made it better? _________ 1. Consider the differences between listening to, reading and viewing news stories: Ask students to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of listening to stories about news, rather than being able to watch a video or read an article about the same subject. Which of the three do they generally prefer for getting news? Why? Are some better for particular kinds of content than others? What examples can they give? To investigate further, students might use important breaking news that is told in all three formats, as The Learning Network did in this lesson plan on the student gun-violence activists at Stoneman Douglas High School. Divide students into groups, with some listening to an episode of “The Daily” or other kind of audio report, some watching a video, from The Times or elsewhere, and some reading a news article, all on the same topic or event. Then, have them discuss what they learned from the various formats, and what they thought was missing. What were the strengths and weaknesses of telling the story in each medium? Which do they think they prefer? Why? For homework, they might then watch, read or listen to the two formats they missed, and write a reflection about the differences and their own reactions to them. Which format did they learn from most easily? Why do they think that is? What does that tell them about how they might prefer to gain access to news reporting in the future? (Note: Exercises like this were part of The Learning Network’s recent News Diet Challenge, in which students were invited to experiment until they found the right personal mix of sources, platforms and formats to best consume the onslaught of information we are all confronted with daily.) 2. Investigate sound elements: Embellished by an elegantly produced mix of intricate musical interludes, soundbites and archival newsreel, the conversations on “The Daily” give listeners an inside glimpse into the firsthand experience of reporting major news developments and watching them unfold. A Times Insider piece, “How ‘The Daily’ Sounds Out the News,” explores what makes the audio unique: With episodes five days a week, the one-year-old podcast uses sound in a way that often differs from traditional news podcasts and broadcasts. “It’s more like an audio documentary,” said Andy Mills, a reporter and one of the show’s founding producers. While traditional audio reports can rely on journalists outlining the facts of the news, “The Daily” asks reporters to describe the scene in which the news occurred, incorporating scene-setting audio and letting sources speak uninterrupted. Episodes are about 20 minutes long, and though there is no specific formula, there is a guiding principle: “Use a lot of tape,” Mr. Mills said. “And by that we mean the sound of things happening in the world and the sound of people speaking unprompted, unscripted.” To get that material, the team helps Times journalists to think with their ears. “We started to work with reporters to just vacuum up all of the sounds around them as they’re reporting something, not just the quotable moments from when you’re with the senator, but when you’re getting out of the car, when you’re walking up to the house,” said Annie Brown, another reporter and “Daily” producer. Ask students to identify sound elements in the episode they listen to that help make the story more engaging and memorable. How many different types did they note? Which elements were particularly effective? (For example, here is an exploration of the role the theme song plays.) The article also points out the role sound plays in “creating a world”: The show emphasizes emotion and the lives of the people connected to its stories by including clips that might not otherwise make it past the editing phase. Listeners have written in to talk about episodes that resonate with them, like one about assisted suicide, which included the sounds of family members celebrating the life of John Shields, a man suffering from an incurable disease, at a wake he threw for himself. “We’re creating a world in which the story lives, rather than just using audio as ornamentation,” Ms. Brown said. How do the episodes your students listen to “create a world”? Invite students to identify print pieces in The New York Times that might benefit from sounds from the field as in the story mentioned above. What parts of the article suggest rich worlds of sound to them? If they were the producer turning the print piece into a podcast, what sounds would they suggest journalists capture? Why? Finally, students might listen to The Year in Sound: An Audio Time Capsule of 2017 to learn “what a breathtaking year sounded like, from start to finish.” Before they start, however, you might ask them to list predictions: What sounds captured the news of 2017? Then, as they listen, they can see how many are captured in this piece. 3. Hone interviewing skills: Mr. Barbaro interviews his colleagues in a relaxed, conversational format, encouraging them to speak candidly in down-to-earth exchanges that highlight their personalities and those of the people they cover — an intimate style rarely conveyed in print reporting. “Often times, [the reporters] have something figured out,” he explained in an October 2017 interview with Recode Media. “But sometimes they’re in the middle of figuring it out.… Journalists can say what they know and say what they don’t know, and talk very openly about their process. It creates a lot of transparency that people really crave right now.” For example, days after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017, Mr. Barbaro talked to a local City Council member and a Times reporter as the city was at a turning point. How does he help his audience understand the issues at stake? Ask students to observe the way Michael Barbaro interviews reporters and other people on his show. They might then discuss: • How do the interviews help listeners to become more actively invested in the story? • How would you compare his style to the style of other radio or television hosts who interview? • What aspects of Mr. Barbaro’s interviewing style seem most effective? Least? • What can you learn from him about asking open-ended questions that encourage people to think aloud? Then ask students to identify an expert of any kind to interview on the topic of their choice, and have them compose their questions in advance. Then, have them conduct an interview and record it. Together as a class, have them then discuss what the experience was like. Did they get the information they were looking for? What would they do differently? Now that they’ve tried their own hands at interviewing, will they hear podcast and radio interviews differently? How? 4. Localize stories from “The Daily” for your own community: Which topics covered on “The Daily” especially intrigue your students? Which connect best to their own lives or communities? What questions would they ask if they were conducting their own interviews on the topic with people they know? Invite them to brainstorm a list, then work in groups to choose a national or international story like “A Ticking Clock for DACA” or “Guns and the Midterm Elections” and brainstorm all the ways it affects the people they know. Whether for a school radio or TV station or for a school or community print paper, what piece could they write and produce about the issue’s local resonance? Who are the people they would interview? What would they ask? How could they frame it? Where would they publish it, and for whom? 5. Bring it all together: Use “The Daily” as a mentor text for your own podcast: This spring, The Learning Network will host its first-ever podcast challenge for teenagers. Though many details are yet to be announced, here is a brief overview. Visit our Contest Calendar on April 26 for more details and a related lesson plan. Podcast Challenge | April 26-May 25, 2018 Create a podcast of five minutes or less that is inspired by one of our thousand-plus Student Opinion questions. That question, however, should just be your starting point. As long as you address it somehow, your podcast can be in whatever format you think works best. For example, it can be structured as a one-person narration, a conversation between two or more people, or a series of interviews. It can be for educational or entertainment purposes, and can showcase reporting, a personal story or an opinion. Consider using “The Daily” — as well as other Times podcasts like “Modern Love” or “Still Processing” — as mentor texts for this challenge. To prepare, students might ask themselves questions like: • How does the structure of each episode hook the listener? How does it tell a story, with a beginning, middle and end? How does it keep you listening? • How does the host propel the narrative? What makes that person and his or her style appealing? Effective? • What elements of sound are used? Why? How? What makes them effective? _________ The Vandal and the Mosque: A New Chapter of Forgiveness in Arkansas: A powerful and sensitively told story about bigotry, mistakes and redemption Blue Collar Factory Jobs in the Rearview Mirror: A poignant episode on the very human side of a major political issue U.S. Ends Protections for Salvadorans: A good example of how the show takes deep dives into an issue, connects the historical dots and explains how we got to where we are now Robert Mugabe’s Rise and Fall: A good example of how “The Daily” can deepen understanding of a well-recapped major international story The ACLU and the Alt-Right: A fascinating story about the complexities of the First Amendment Mental Health and Mass Shootings: How can the mental health system stop gun violence when mental illness is so rarely the cause of it?

Subscribe to the Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. T’Challa, also known as the Black Panther, the title character of the blockbuster movie, wasn’t the first person to land a spaceship (or something like it) in downtown Oakland, Calif. In the 1973 film “Space Is the Place,” the musician Sun Ra and his band descend into Oakland from their new home planet, seeking African-Americans to join them, “to see,” as he puts it, “what they can do with a planet all their own, without any white people on it.” In “Black Panther,” T’Challa establishes a tech exchange enterprise in Oakland; in “Space Is the Place,” Sun Ra opens the Outer Space Employment Agency. When “Black Panther,” directed by Ryan Coogler, opened in late January, there was a brief and counterproductive online discussion as to whether it was proper to deem it the first true black superhero movie. More interesting have been the subsequent discussions of the theme of Afrofuturism. The term, coined in a 1993 essay by the cultural critic Mark Dery, is defined differently by different writers and thinkers; through my own critical lens, I tend to see is as an aesthetic that illuminates African culture’s intertwining with the cosmic (in both the technological and metaphysical senses). Relative to “Black Panther,” the movie’s mythology of Wakanda, a technologically advanced African country “hiding in plain sight,” presenting itself to the world as largely faceless, is an Afrofuturist concept to be sure. Afrofuturism is more prominent in music and the graphic arts than it is in cinema, but there are movies out there that illuminate the notion in different ways. Here are a few that can be watched on streaming video. “Space Is the Place,” which can be viewed in its 81-minute cut on YouTube (a 61-minute cut, which omits some odd sexploitation-movie elements, had been available to stream on the arts site UbuWeb, but the video link would not respond when I checked) was conceived as a concert picture by John Coney, a PBS director, but Sun Ra had something different in mind when he wrote the narrative film with Joshua Smith; it begins with the Sun Ra Arkestra chanting “It’s after the end of the world.” The movie time-travels back to the 1940s, and Sun Ra’s origins as a boogie-woogie and stride piano player. It allegorically pits the enlightened orchestra leader against a Machiavellian “Overseer;” the two play cards in an obscure battle for black humanity. The crux of Sun Ra’s philosophy emerges in a scene in which he and his emissaries, dressed in garb that evokes both sci-fi and ancient Egypt, confront a group of skeptical teenagers in an Oakland youth center. “I do not come to you as a reality, but as a myth,” he says. “Because that’s what black people are. Myths. I am a dream that the black man dreams long ago. I’m actually a present sent to you by your ancestors.” The use of the present tense in describing a black man who “dreams long ago” is no accident. In Afrofuturism, time is frequently looped. The Art Ensemble of Chicago, a musical collective affiliated with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (a group that tended to distance itself from Sun Ra because of differences in praxis) made its motto “Great Black Music: Ancient to Future.” In the Wakanda of “Black Panther,” incredible medical and construction technology exists hand in hand with ancient practices like the “Challenge Day” battle ritual shown early in the movie. Similarly, although it deals exclusively with a circa-13th-century African myth, “Yeelen,” or “Brightness,” a 1987 film directed by Souleymane Cissé, can be considered in the context of Afrofuturism, particularly because Mr. Cissé, a director from Mali, approaches it like a narrative documentary. The movie, available to stream on Kanopy, follows a young mage on a journey to confront his power-mad father. A man-hyena speaking from a treetop is treated matter-of-factly, rather than as a mystical or mystifying occurrence. Mr. Cissé’s languid but mindful pacing and his indifference to Western film language conventions on space and time transitions also contribute to the movie’s distinction. More radical still is “Touki Bouki,” a 1973 road movie of sorts directed by the Senegalese filmmaker Djibril Diop Mambéty, which is available for streaming on the Criterion Channel of FilmStruck. Mory (Magaye Niang), a cattle herder (trigger warning: the movie opens with some very graphic slaughterhouse footage) rides a motorbike with a bull’s horns attached to its handlebars; he’s aiming to leave Africa for France and enlists the lithe, enigmatic Anta (Mareme Niang) to join him. Egged on by the Josephine Baker song “Paris Paris,” they go in search of money and find mostly trouble. In one scene, in a tricked-out car, Mory is driven down a deserted road, declaiming his greatness; Mambéty cuts to scenes of crowds on a different road, seemingly cheering him on; these two lines of footage eventually converge. The movie is replete with such purposeful disjointedness, the better to articulate space-time dissociations. (And the movie’s influence continues to resonate. Earlier this week, to announce their joint tour, Jay-Z and Beyoncé posted on Instagram an image paying direct homage to “Touki Bouki”: a shot of the couple seated on a motorcycle with a horned animal skull mounted on its handlebars.) “Yeelen” and “Touki Bouki” are both arguably art films, but Afrofuturism doesn’t adhere to genre hierarchies. If it did, you wouldn’t be able to discuss it in the context of a superhero movie based on a comic book. Afrofuturism is equally at home with the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Parliament-Funkadelic. In his essay, Mr. Dery also examined the works of African-American science-fiction writers like Samuel R. Delany. On Fandor, there’s a good documentary film about him, “The Polymath: Or the Life and Opinions of Samuel R. Delany, Gentleman.” Mr. Delany has a fascinating life story and a truly radical philosophy of life that reverberates through his books. Being an African-American gay man, he says, imposes on him a responsibility to live his life “as if the world worked differently.” Subsequently, he notes, to read his works “you have to inhabit the world I live in.” The film, directed by Fred Barney Taylor, presents central points in Mr. Delany’s life out of linear order, as if the movie itself were unstuck in time. One of Mr. Delany’s key works, his 1975 novel, “Dhalgren,” is an after-the-end-of-the-world epic that’s also reflective of the sexually exuberant pre-AIDS New York underground Mr. Delany inhabited at the time. “He’s a philosophical, confessional and fictional genius,” the author Jonathan Lethem says of Mr. Delany in the movie. One tidbit in the documentary brings us back around to the medium in which “Black Panther” originated: In the 1970s Mr. Delany was the writer for two issues of the DC comic “Wonder Woman.”",The New York Times
2018,Explosions Rattle Austin as Calls About Suspicious Packages Mount,"AUSTIN, Tex. — A mundane part of modern-day life and commerce — a package left on a doorstep — has set off waves of anxiety here in the Texas capital, after three packages with homemade bombs inside exploded and killed two people. Since the authorities asked the public on Monday to report any unexpected packages that did not come from an official distributor like the United States Postal Service, Austin police officials have received 265 calls from residents about suspicious packages. The police, who have said they believed the explosions are linked, were responding to each report. The flurry of 911 calls illustrated residents’ fears, particularly in the three neighborhoods where the packages exploded. The bomber appeared to have avoided mailing the packages and instead placed them by the victims’ front doors. On Tuesday, on the quiet Oldfort Hill Drive, where one of the devices detonated the day before, Tracy Nguyen, 32, an advertising employee who lives on the street, said she was “even afraid to check my mailbox,” adding, “I know that’s a little paranoid.” In the span of 10 days in Austin, two people have been killed and three people injured in a series of package explosions so powerful that the reverberations shook the windows and walls blocks away. The suspect or suspects appear to have left the packages at three homes in the northeast and eastern sections of the city — one on March 2, and another two on Monday. Inside the packages were improvised explosive devices. In two of the bombings, the devices detonated when residents picked them up, and in the third, the package exploded after the person carried it into the house and opened it, officials said. At a news conference on Tuesday, Chief Brian Manley of the Austin Police Department told reporters that investigators were not ruling out that the attacks were terrorist acts or hate crimes. All of the deceased and wounded victims in the bombings were black or Hispanic. Earlier in the day, the mayor of Austin, Steve Adler, said it was too early in the investigation to establish the motive. “It would be wrong at this point for our public safety folks to pick one direction before we have enough information, because that might mean that they would overlook something else,” Mr. Adler told reporters. Two of the people killed after handling the packages were members of African-American families with deep roots in the city’s black, religious and civil-rights groups. Community leaders in Austin said the first fatal victim on March 2, Anthony Stephan House, 39, was the stepson of Freddie B. Dixon, 73, a retired United Methodist minister and civil rights advocate. The other fatal victim on Monday, Draylen Mason, 17, was the grandson of Norman L. Mason, a prominent dentist. Mr. Dixon and the elder Mr. Mason have known each other for years: Mr. Dixon and Mr. Mason’s wife were among the founders of the Austin Area Urban League in the late 1970s. “We’re not jumping to conclusions, but based on what’s known, we’re on heightened alert,” said Gary L. Bledsoe, the president of the Texas N.A.A.C.P. and a lawyer who lives in Austin. He said he was being watchful of packages delivered both to his home and his office. “If it’s a package I’m not expecting, then I’m not going to open it,” Mr. Bledsoe said, adding, “and I’m telling everyone else to do the same thing. We don’t really know what’s happening, so the best thing to do is just not take possession of such a package.” The 17-year-old who died on Monday, Draylen Mason, was a promising classical musician who was set to enter the University of Texas’s Butler School of Music this fall to study music performance, a competitive program. A double bassist, he played in the orchestra at his high school, East Austin College Prep, as well as during church services on Sundays. Since he was 11, he had been a member of the Austin Soundwaves, a youth orchestra program that taught music in underserved city schools that lacked music programs of their own. He was “a remarkably and precociously talented bass player,” Doug Dempster, the dean of the University of Texas at Austin’s College of Fine Arts, who serves on the program’s board, said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. During performances in recent years, Mr. Dempster said, he often noticed Draylen leading and coaching younger players. “He was every inch a musician. He carried himself with a kind of quiet maturity that belied his youth,” Mr. Dempster said. “His gentle confidence seemed to come from a conviction that hard work and talent was going to work for him. It did.” On Tuesday, Chief Manley said investigators were trying to determine what the victims had in common. “One of the key things we’re trying to understand — is there a connection between the victims, what is the victimology, what is the motive behind these attacks?” he said. Earlier, Chief Manley told KXAN News in a television interview that building, transporting and delivering the devices to the homes without the bombs prematurely exploding showed “a level of skill.” The police chief added: “When the victims have picked these packages up, they have at that point exploded. There is a certain level of skill and sophistication that whoever is doing this has.” The F.B.I., A.T.F. and Postal Service have all sent specialists to help investigate the bombings. Chief Manley encouraged the public to continue calling in tips and offered a combined $65,000 reward — $50,000 from the city and $15,000 from the state — for information leading to an arrest. In the neighborhood that was the scene of the first bombing, the red-brick home on Haverford Drive where the package exploded still has plywood covering the front door. The wall next to the door has an exposed gash, and the doorbell, still lit, dangles from a wire. Neighbors said that they had a heightened awareness of suspicious packages, but that they were not changing their routines or behaviors a great deal. “We’re not going to stop ordering packages,” said Don Shin, 40, a software developer who lives near the scene of the explosion on Haverford Drive. “We’re certainly going to be a lot more mindful of what we’re expecting and what we’re not expecting.” Moments later, after Mr. Shin drove away with his wife and children, a sign of normalcy was visible at his door: a large box from Amazon.",The New York Times
2018,Expressive Hands Model the Season’s Most Distinctive Jewelry,"Jewelry Report Four creative women — Esperanza Spalding, Rita Sodi, Catherine Zuber and Yto Barrada — adorn themselves in sparkling jewels. The prodigious composer and performer cuts a dazzling figure onstage, a place she’s been commanding since she was 8 and played violin with the Chamber Music Society of Oregon. Spalding’s voice can pitch, within beats, from high and bright to warm and sensuous, like a stream of fresh water running down a mountain. This past December, she released her sixth album, “Exposure.” The experimental album is an attempt to capture the experience of listening to live music, and was created in 77 consecutive hours, broadcast live on Facebook and released in a beautifully packaged limited edition of 7,777 copies. Spalding, who is based in Boston, is currently considering an accompanying tour. “It was just going to exist as this performance in real time and not have an afterlife,” says the 33-year-old. “The end result was really special and different.” A decade after the Italian-born, Manhattan-based 56-year-old chef opened her first restaurant, I Sodi, on Christopher Street, it remains as close to Tuscany as you can get in the West Village, with traditionally prepared dishes like Cornish game hens and house-crimped ravioli. She next opened the rustically charming Via Carota in 2014 with her partner and fellow chef Jody Williams (the owner of the nearby French-inflected all-day bar, Buvette) — a synthesis of their two sensibilities — and soon, kitty corner, a snack bar called Pisellino. With Sodi, the food always tastes as good as it looks: There is never an object or dish too fussy or pretentious, from the simple-yet-decadent marble backsplash at I Sodi to the beautifully bright, sparsely adorned seasonal greens at Via Carota. This N.Y.C.-based Broadway veteran of theater and opera costume design doesn’t shy from drama, especially when it comes to her sense of style. “Gloves complete an outfit, and elevate it to another level,” she says. “It’s a throwback to a time when a lady would always wear gloves no matter what. You feel a little more in the party spirit when you have them on.” Whether it’s for a drama like the mid-20th-century Manhattan-set “War Paint” or a classic Shakespeare play, the 67-year-old Zuber possesses an uncanny ability to create period dress that feels of the time but also dazzlingly modern. (Just look at her fantastically saturated interpretations of working women’s power suits of the 1950s, in electrified shades of violet and rose, for “War Paint.”) Currently, she’s creating costumes for Lincoln Center Theater’s new production of “My Fair Lady” (performances begin this March) and for Alex Timbers’s Broadway adaptation of “Moulin Rouge!,” set to open sometime next year. “I prefer to do things by hand,” says the 46-year-old French-Moroccan multimedia visual artist. Barrada, who was raised in Tangier and educated in Paris and New York, where she currently lives, is a photographer and filmmaker, and the founder of Morocco’s Cinémathèque de Tanger, an independent “world cinema” movie theater that screens documentary and experimental films. She also makes her own large-scale textiles and sculptures that address everything from urban planning to paleontology. Her upcoming solo show, which will include her artistic investigations into hand-dying techniques (among other things), opens at Pace Gallery on 57th Street in Manhattan this spring, and her first major commission for the City of London opened last month at the Barbican; the installation, filled with murals, films and sculptures that examine the 1960 earthquake that devastated Morocco’s Agadir, questions how a city reacts and reinvents itself after such a disaster. “It’s a metaphor for other natural disasters,” says Barrada. “War, colonialism, any experience of trauma, loss and reconstruction.” Manicurist: Rica Romain at LMC.

2018,"Expulsions, France, Facebook: Your Tuesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A collective response to Russia, a brutal hate crime in France and a mysterious train in Beijing. Here’s the latest: • Sixty diplomats expelled, the Seattle consulate shut. The United States joined European allies in kicking out Russian officials over the nerve gas poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil. But President Trump avoided any public condemnation of Russia’s role in the attack. We examine how an outraged Europe agreed to the hard line against Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. The coordinated response is a win for Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, and a show of unity by NATO allies after a year of fraying ties. The expulsions were Mr. Trump’s toughest action yet against the Kremlin. In the special investigation into his ties to Russia, Mr. Trump is essentially down to a one-man legal defense team after two newly hired lawyers bowed out. _____ • “To attack a Jew is to attack France.” That was French interior minister, Gérard Collomb, condemning the brutal murder in Paris of Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old Jewish woman who had survived the Holocaust. A number of anti-Semitic episodes have shaken France, and the speed with which the authorities labeled Ms. Knoll’s killing, in the apartment building above, a hate crime is being seen as a reaction to anger at the official response to the murder last year of another older Jewish woman. That woman was killed by a man who shouted, “God is great” and threw her out a window. Prosecutors took months to characterize that crime as anti-Semitic. _____ • President Trump secured his first major trade deal. The U.S. and South Korea agreed to renegotiate their trade pact, with Seoul exempted from tariffs on steel and aluminum in exchange for reducing its steel exports and opening its market to American cars. The deal, discussed by South Korea’s trade minister, above, looked like early vindication of the White House’s efforts to use the tariffs as a bargaining chip. Meanwhile, many are wondering if Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s reclusive leader, is in Beijing. The question emerged after a video showed an old-style green train — similar to one previously used by North Korea’s leaders — arriving in the Chinese capital amid high security. _____ • Anti-abortion campaigners have flooded Ireland as the country prepares to vote in May on a referendum on whether to repeal its ban on abortion. But not all of them are Irish, raising fears of foreign interference in the vote. _____ • A “shocking betrayal.” A U.S. Army veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan was deported to Mexico after his application for citizenship was denied because of a felony drug conviction. The case of Miguel Perez-Montes (above, in a photo held by his father), who had been given a diagnosis of P.T.S.D., rose to prominence after a U.S. senator who served in Iraq appealed to the Department of Homeland Security to stay his deportation. _____ • The diplomatic tensions between the West and Russia appear to be dampening interest in visiting Russia for the 2018 World Cup, at least for soccer fans in the United States and England. • Our reporters uncovered the ways one of President Trump’s top fund-raisers leveraged his political connections to help his business, an illustration of a new breed of access peddling proliferating in the Washington swamp Mr. Trump vowed to drain. • Hong Kong’s housing market is so tight that “nano flats,” smaller than 200 square feet, are all the rage.

On this day in 1915, Mary Mallon, nicknamed Typhoid Mary, was placed in quarantine for the second time in New York City. Though she never displayed any symptoms of the disease, she would be confined for the rest of her life. In 1906, health officials tied Ms. Mallon to outbreaks of typhoid fever in seven wealthy families for whom she had worked as a cook. She was confirmed to be a carrier of the disease and quarantined. Doctors released her in 1910 under the condition that she no longer work as a cook. Shortly after, she disappeared. Ms. Mallon was rediscovered in 1915 by officials investigating a typhoid outbreak in a Manhattan hospital. She had been working there as a cook under an assumed name. She was then quarantined for 23 years, until her death in 1938 after a stroke. During her life, the public was fascinated by Ms. Mallon, above. She often appeared in news stories and cartoons, with one depicting her frying skulls in a pan. She was frustrated by the attention and by her captivity, once describing herself as “a peep show for everybody.” Her case is often referenced during public health crises, such as the Ebola epidemic, in debates over the power of officials to quarantine people they believe carry diseases.

2018,"Exxon Mobil Scraps a Russian Deal, Stymied by Sanctions","HOUSTON — Exxon Mobil is abandoning its joint exploration ventures with the Russian oil company Rosneft, retreating from what was one of its most promising investments until Western sanctions got in the way. During the early years of the Obama administration, when there was a brief warming of relations, Exxon Mobil signed an exploration deal with the Russians. Exxon and Rosneft, which is only half-owned by the Russian government but state-run, agreed to invest $3.2 billion to search for oil in deepwater fields in the Arctic and elsewhere. After Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the United States and its European allies applied several sanctions on Moscow, eventually freezing Exxon’s investments. In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Exxon said that it had decided late last year to abandon the ventures this year and would take an after-tax loss of $200 million. “The corporation and its affiliates continue to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations,” the company said. With its investments already frozen by the sanctions, it was not clear what current activities, if any, Exxon’s move affected. The company has operations in Russia that are allowed under the sanctions, including an oil and gas production venture on Sakhalin, an island in the Siberian Arctic, and has had a business presence there for roughly a quarter-century. An Exxon spokesman said the company would have no comment beyond the filing. In any case, the move sends a signal, said David Goldwyn, who was the State Department’s top energy diplomat early in the Obama administration. “It’s a sign that the company realizes that U.S.-Russia relations and in particular sanctions are not likely to change soon,” he said. “They are an enormous source of friction with the government, and it is better business for them to steer their business away from sanctioned activities.” In July, Exxon sued the Treasury Department after it was fined $2 million for violating the Russia sanctions. The company had signed agreements with Igor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive and a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, when he was under sanctions. The company argued that government guidance had indicated that Mr. Sechin was blacklisted for personal conduct, not in his role as the oil company executive. Under the last four years of sanctions, Exxon and other Western oil companies have been prevented from using their technological expertise to help Rosneft’s oil and gas development. Stymied by the sanctions, Exxon was forced to look elsewhere for new reserves. It is investing heavily in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, and off the shores of several developing countries, including Guyana. The sanctions forced Rosneft, too, to look beyond Russia for new reserves. The Russians have helped Venezuela and its state oil company avert a financial collapse with new loans. In recent years, Rosneft has increasingly become a foreign-policy tool of the Kremlin, embarrassing its Western oil company partners. Long a financial bulwark of the Russian government, it has more recently been investing heavily in sensitive countries like Cuba, China and Vietnam, along with Venezuela.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Eyes Here: Weekend Reads From the Opinion Section,"Opinion Were you distracted by the full Nunberg; that Trumpy trade war (truly, the least bad option of the wars we could be facing, h/t Trevor Noah); or all that storm news? Here are some selections for your weekend reading, in case you missed them the first time around. From the Editorial Board: An alarming new study found that African-Americans and Latinos were far more likely to be denied conventional mortgages than whites even when income, loan size and other factors were taken into account. _____ Before he puts his name to a Supreme Court opinion that is expected to eviscerate public-sector unions, Justice Samuel Alito Jr. should visit West Virginia. _____ You don’t say. A three-part series addressed the history of nepotism and politics and provided close looks at the worrisome roles of both Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. _____ From Op-Ed contributors: Four years ago, there were 15,000 people in Afghanistan working to remove unexploded bombs and grenades. Now there are only 5,000. International donors have scaled back their funding for these operations, but the need is still great, writes photographer Victor J. Blue. The unintentional casualties are civilians, often curious children, who pick up and step on old munitions. _____ Researchers analyzed the diffusion of all of the major true and false stories that spread on Twitter from its inception in 2006 to 2017. Disturbingly, they found that false stories spread significantly more than did true ones. Read a report from the researchers, featured in the “Gray Matter” column from Sunday Review. _____ Reconnecting A.I. with fields like cognitive science, psychology and even sociology will give us a far richer foundation on which to base the development of machine intelligence, writes Fei-Fei Li, the director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab. _____ Since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., officials have been calling for changes in how we handle people with mental health problems. Norman J. Ornstein wrote about his painful experience trying to get help for his son, advocating for both gun reform laws and better resources for the mental health system. _____ The North Korean regime never gives anything away for free, writes Victor Cha, an expert once under consideration to serve President Trump as ambassador to South Korea. _____ Jules Woodson says she was 17 when her youth pastor, Andy Savage, sexually assaulted her. In an Op-Ed video, she offers commentary while viewing Mr. Savage’s apology to his mega-congregation for what he calls a “sexual incident.” He received a standing ovation. _____ The remarkable successes of these directors — and the ways in which they’ve made their heritage part of more-universal movies — is a reminder of how ethnic and cultural diversity can enrich the movie industry. By Ioan Grillo, a contributing writer. _____ How, many wonder, could a Buddhist society — especially Buddhist monks! — have anything to do with something so monstrously violent as the ethnic cleansing now being perpetrated on Myanmar’s long-beleaguered Rohingya minority? Even if we suppose that most Buddhists, or members of any other religious group, really do hold beliefs that are pacifist and tolerant, we have no reason to expect that they will really be pacifist and tolerant. From The Stone series on philosophy. _____ And I will close with a message from a reader: “In some societies the elderly are revered. I don’t wish to be revered, only to be accepted as I am, for who I am, an 88-year-old woman who holds the wisdom of her years and looks it.” (Right there with you, Betty.)",The New York Times
2018,F.A.A. Halts ‘Doors-Off’ Helicopter Flights After New York Crash,"In the wake of the crash that killed five people in New York City, federal regulators on Friday afternoon ordered an immediate stop to all “doors-off” helicopter flights that attach passengers to the cabin with harnesses that cannot be removed quickly in an emergency. The Federal Aviation Administration said that the directive applied to all helicopter operators that offer such flights across the country. Riding in a helicopter with the doors off, or open, to allow unimpeded photography has become a popular adventure in certain areas, including New York City. On Sunday, a helicopter that carried five passengers who were wearing harnesses that allowed them to lean out the open doors crashed into the East River. All five passengers drowned after the helicopter capsized in the frigid water and rescue divers struggled to free those trapped inside. Only the pilot survived. “Operators, pilots, and consumers should be aware of the hazard presented by supplemental restraint devices in the event of an emergency evacuation during ‘doors-off’ flights,” the F.A.A. said in a statement released on Friday. “The F.A.A. will order operators and pilots to take immediate actions to control or mitigate this risk. Until then, the F.A.A. will order no more ‘doors-off’ operations that involve restraints that cannot be released quickly in an emergency.” These flights have operated under a less-strict set of rules for aircraft than those used for certain commercial purposes such as crop-dusting and aerial photography. But when federal aviation regulators created those exemptions, they did not contemplate a day when millions of people would be carrying small electronic devices that could take panoramic pictures or record videos. Passengers aboard these helicopters can use their smartphones to capture images of their feet dangling in the air over the Statue of Liberty, the Las Vegas Strip or a Hawaiian volcano. The growing, though costly, desire for that experience is what brought the five victims together on Sunday. They were Trevor Cadigan and Brian McDaniel, both 26, high school friends from Dallas; Carla Vallejos Blanco, 29, of Corrientes, Argentina; and Daniel Thompson, 34, and Tristan Hill, 29, who worked for SightSy, a sightseeing website. Through a New Jersey-based company, FlyNYON, they had booked seats on a whirlwind tour of New York City from the air at sunset. The AS350 Eurocopter they boarded was operated by Liberty Helicopters, one of the biggest sightseeing tour operators in the New York metropolitan area, and flown by one of Liberty’s pilots, Richard Vance. The passengers put on harnesses before boarding the helicopter and those harnesses were hooked to the inside of the cabin. The potential difficulty of cutting oneself loose in an emergency was highlighted by the provision of small blades for cutting through the tethers. Eric Adams, an aviation journalist and photographer who was aboard a different Liberty helicopter on Sunday evening, said riders were strapped in from the rear, with carabiners attaching their harnesses to tethers. Mr. Adams said even though he had flown in similar helicopters before, he did not know where his knife was or how to unlock the carabiner. FlyNYON did not respond on Friday to messages seeking comment. Since the crash, the company and Liberty have referred reporters’ questions to federal agencies. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board are gathering evidence from the damaged helicopter and talking to witnesses and rescuers to determine the cause of the crash and what role the restraints played in the drownings. On Thursday, they said they had interviewed Mr. Vance, who was injured in the crash, though not seriously. While that investigation goes on, the F.A.A. is reconsidering what its rules should be for the protection of passengers on doors-off flights, or whether they should be sanctioned at all. In the meantime, the administration has halted the flights altogether, a potentially hard blow to operators like FlyNYON, which had drawn a following by arranging open-door flights over Manhattan and around the Statue of Liberty. FlyNYON also operates doors-off flights in Las Vegas, South Florida and California. The F.A.A. grounding may not apply to all doors-off helicopter flights. Paradise Helicopters, a Hawaiian helicopter tour company whose offerings include a “Doors-Off Lava & Rainforests Adventure” for $324 per person, said it would keep flying. Calvin Dorn, the chief executive of Paradise Helicopters, said in a statement that his company “does not use the type of harness or aircraft involved in this incident.” Mr. Dorn said Paradise uses “F.A.A.-approved seatbelts with quick releases on our flights as well as conducting specific passenger safety training prior to each flight.

Investigated Sessions for Possible Perjury Over Russia Denials,"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. investigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury last year over congressional testimony in which he said he had no contacts with Russians, according to three people familiar with the case. In fact, Mr. Sessions later acknowledged, he had personally met the Russian ambassador to the United States during the campaign and was aware that George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser, had developed Russian ties, too. F.B.I. agents were aware of both inaccuracies in real time. And last March, when Congress asked the F.B.I. to investigate the attorney general, agents began doing so, two of the people said. Andrew G. McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director at the time, authorized the investigation, the two people said. Mr. McCabe himself was recently fired for showing “lack of candor” in an internal investigation. Mr. Sessions rejected Mr. McCabe’s appeal and fired him hours before his retirement was to take effect, jeopardizing his pension. The investigation into Mr. Sessions began before Robert S. Mueller III was appointed special counsel to investigate Russia-related matters. Mr. Sessions’s lawyer, Chuck Cooper, said no investigation is being conducted now. “The special counsel’s office has informed me that after interviewing the attorney general and conducting additional investigation, the attorney general is not under investigation for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and related written submissions to Congress,” Mr. Cooper said in a statement. The investigation was first reported by ABC News. Perjury investigations based on congressional referrals are common, and the F.B.I. frequently investigates but seldom charges. But the fact that the attorney general himself was a focus of the Russia investigation, even if only peripherally and temporarily, shows how entangled the Trump administration has become in the case. Mr. Sessions is recused from any aspect of the investigation. The investigation also adds a new layer to Mr. McCabe’s firing. Mr. McCabe’s lawyers have said that he did not lie and acted quickly to fix any inaccuracies or misunderstandings. Mr. Sessions has offered a similar defense, saying he never intended to mislead Congress. A spokeswoman for Mr. McCabe, Melissa Schwartz, had no comment. A person close to Mr. Sessions said the attorney general was not aware of the investigation into his congressional statements when he fired Mr. McCabe. The investigation never came up during the negotiations over whether Mr. Sessions would fire Mr. McCabe, according to two people with knowledge of those discussions. The testimony in question surfaced as part of Mr. Sessions’s confirmation hearing in January 2017. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked Mr. Sessions about a recent CNN report that Trump campaign surrogates and Russian government intermediaries had exchanged information during the campaign. “If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?” Mr. Franken asked. “I’m not aware of any of those activities,” Mr. Sessions replied. “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have — did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.” After The Washington Post revealed that Mr. Sessions had met privately with the Russian ambassador, Mr. Sessions returned to Capitol Hill and said his testimony had been accurate if read in the context of Mr. Franken’s larger question. He said he met the ambassador in his capacity as a senator, not as a campaign surrogate. “You don’t believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?” Mr. Franken asked in October. “I did not, and I’m not aware of anyone else that did,” Mr. Sessions replied. “And I don’t believe it happened.” That only compounded Mr. Sessions’s problems because court documents and news reports soon revealed that Mr. Papadopoulos, a young campaign aide, had boasted about his Russian ties in a meeting with Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump. Mr. Sessions returned to Congress and again denied lying. “I have always told the truth,” Mr. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee in November. He said he stood by his previous testimony because “I had no recollection of this meeting until I saw these news reports.” Mr. McCabe’s allies have pointed in recent days to these clarifications and asked why Mr. McCabe did not receive the same benefit of the doubt as the attorney general. But it is impossible to compare the cases because the Justice Department’s inspector general has not released his report explaining his concerns about Mr. McCabe’s candor. Mr. Mueller is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election and whether anyone in the Trump campaign participated in those efforts. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said there was “no collusion,” and his aides initially flatly denied any contacts between the campaign and Russia. But journalists and investigators have uncovered repeated examples of those contacts, including one in which a Kremlin-connected lawyer met with top campaign officials at Trump Tower after promising politically damaging information about Hillary Clinton. And Mr. Papadopoulos has testified that he learned from an intermediary to the Russian government that Moscow had damaging emails about Mrs. Clinton before that was publicly known. Mr. Mueller interviewed Mr. Sessions early this year as part of his investigation. Mr. Mueller’s office recently told Mr. Cooper that he could publicly say that the attorney general was not under investigation and was considered a witness in the case. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called the special counsel investigation a witch hunt, and his lawyer recently called for it to be shut down. Mr. Mueller has indicted Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman on tax and foreign lobbying charges and 13 Russians on fraud charges related to election interference. Two former campaign aides and Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser have pleaded guilty and are cooperating. Mr. Mueller has also requested to interview Mr. Trump. Defense lawyers are negotiating the terms of such an interview, which carries great risk for a president known for hyperbole and inaccurate statements.",The New York Times
2018,F.C.C. Joins Push to Limit China’s Telecom Reach,"The Federal Communications Commission is joining the Trump administration, Congress and other government agencies that have targeted Huawei, China’s giant telecommunications equipment maker, as a national security risk. Ajit Pai, chairman of the commission, on Monday proposed a rule to tighten restrictions on companies building internet infrastructure in the United States. Part of the rule’s impact may be to further crimp Huawei’s meager sales in America by potentially affecting some deals with small and rural carriers, analysts said. The proposed F.C.C. rule would prohibit carriers from using money from the Universal Service Fund to buy gear from companies deemed to pose national security risks. The $8.5 billion fund subsidizes phone, wireless and broadband service to poor and remote communities. Its money comes from small monthly fees on consumers’ phone bills. A first draft of the proposed rule will be published on Tuesday, starting a public comment period. An initial vote on the proposed rule will take place at an agency meeting on April 17. The proposed rule does not mention Huawei by name. Instead, it says it would apply to any telecom supplier or subcontractor defined as a security risk. The agency also said it had not yet determined how it would identify companies that posed a risk to telecom systems, particularly as spying tools. But there was no doubt that Huawei was a target of the proposal. The commission said it might decide to follow the lead of intelligence agencies and Congress. In its military spending authorization, Congress has prohibited the Pentagon from buying network equipment from either Huawei or ZTE, another Chinese equipment maker. Huawei declined to comment. American government policies and regulations, going back years and motivated by security concerns, have already hobbled Huawei’s access to the American market. The big Chinese company had worldwide revenue of more than $90 billion last year. In the United States, its sales were $200 million to $300 million, analysts estimate. Most of the American sales are smartphones, though it does sell some network equipment to small and rural telecom carriers. “This is one more step in the broader confrontation with China,” said Doug Brake, director of telecom policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization. The Russian software company Kaspersky Lab is also on the banned list, after accusations that its antivirus software was a back door for surveillance by Russia’s intelligence agencies. Kaspersky has denied those accusations. The F.C.C. proposal adds to recent moves by Washington to limit the reach of foreign tech companies in the United States. This month, President Trump blocked Broadcom’s $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, a leading maker of smartphone chips. In his order, Mr. Trump said “credible evidence” had led him to believe that if Singapore-based Broadcom acquired control of Qualcomm, it “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Huawei animated those concerns. The administration’s theory was that to make the costly deal pay off, Broadcom would cut back research spending by Qualcomm, undermining its ability to be a leader in next-generation wireless technology, so-called 5G. And that would further open the door for Huawei to win the race for 5G, a critical technology for the economy and for national security. Mr. Pai, a Republican, was encouraged to take action by Congress, specifically in a letter on Sept. 20 from Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican. Later briefings with intelligence agencies added to Mr. Pai’s determination to propose the rule, senior F.C.C. officials said.",The New York Times
2018,"F.D.A. Approves First Home Testing for 3 Breast Cancer Mutations, With Caveats","The Food and Drug Administration for the first time has authorized a genetic testing company to offer screenings for three breast cancer mutations common in Ashkenazi Jews, giving consumers the ability to initiate testing at home and see results without talking to a doctor or counselor. The agency’s action on Tuesday permits the testing company, 23andMe, to report results as part of its $199 Health and Ancestry product, which uses DNA from saliva samples to inform customers about their families’ countries of origin, along with information on genetic health risks. There will be no extra charge for the additional reports, which should be available in a few weeks to customers who actively opt in and request to see them, company officials said. Women who carry one of the three BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are at substantially increased risk for developing breast and ovarian cancer, and men who carry one are at higher risk for breast cancer and may be at higher risk for prostate cancer as well. But testing negative for the three mutations does not mean someone is in the clear, as there are over a thousand BRCA mutations associated with increased cancer risk. Some critics say that comprehensive genetic testing — an exhaustive analysis to detect all mutations associated with an increase in breast cancer risk — is preferable. Physicians, geneticists and policymakers have long been concerned that the enthusiasm over personalized medical information and genetic testing may place consumers who misunderstand or misinterpret results at risk of jeopardizing their health. Even for Jews of Ashkenazi descent, whose families originated in Eastern and Central Europe and who are most likely to test positive for the three mutations, testing negative is no panacea, as they may carry other mutations that increase cancer risk. “The test provides information to certain individuals who may be at increased breast, ovarian or prostate cancer risk and who might not otherwise get genetic screening, and is a step forward in the availability of direct-to-consumer genetic tests. But it has a lot of caveats,” said Donald St. Pierre, acting director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the F.D.A.’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The test should not be used as a substitute for seeing your doctor for cancer screenings or counseling on genetic and lifestyle factors that increase or decrease cancer risk,” he added. This is not the first time that 23andMe will be offering reports on the three BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. The company started reporting to customers on these mutations in 2010 without F.D.A. approval, but stopped providing all health data in 2013 after receiving warnings from the agency, which requested information to prove the test was accurate and provided consistent reproducible results. The agency has also insisted on special controls, including a warning statement explaining the test’s limitations in lay terms stating that a negative test does not rule out other genetic mutations associated with cancer risk, and stipulating that the tests should not be used to determine medical treatment. The warnings also state that the tests should not substitute for visiting a doctor, and that tests confirming the results must be carried out before making medical decisions on treatment, such as anti-hormone therapies, or on prophylactic options like mastectomy or removal of the ovaries. The warning also cautions that people may experience anxiety when undergoing genetic testing, and recommends that they discuss any concerns with their doctor. “My preferred approach would be that this is done in the context of having somebody help you interpret that information, and talk to you about what it means in real time,” said Dr. Susan Domchek, a medical oncologist and expert on breast cancer genetics and prevention at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The chief executive of 23andMe, Anne Wojcicki, said there was high consumer demand for the test. “One of the important things we learned is that a lot of individuals did not even think that they were potential carriers and did not know they had any Jewish ancestry or family history,” she said. “We feel passionately that in some cases this saved their lives.”",The New York Times
2018,FIFA Plans to Launch Women’s League,"BOGOTÁ, Colombia — FIFA President Gianni Infantino will ask members of his executive council to approve plans for a new global women’s league this week. The proposed competition would feature 16 of the world’s top women’s national teams and begin play as early as November 2019. FIFA also plans to add four regional leagues to encourage the development of women’s soccer globally and to allow the best performers from those regions a chance to win promotion to the top division in a system of promotion and relegation. The move is part of an effort to increase the visibility, quality and appeal of women’s soccer and to boost Infantino’s standing before his bid for re-election next year. Investing in the women’s game was a plank in Infantino’s campaign platform in 2015. Under the format, the 16 teams will be divided into four groups and play in minitournaments before the winners face off in semifinals and a final to determine a champion. The top teams would only play in an annual November window, perhaps mitigating the effect of the competition on clubs and other longstanding international tournaments. The smaller regional leagues also would play matches in a spring window. The rationale behind the idea is to grow interest in the women’s game, which until now has been largely financed by the billions of dollars FIFA makes from selling the quadrennial men’s World Cup tournament and currently has only two marquee global tournaments every four years: the Women’s World Cup and the Olympics. Also, with few opportunities for women around the world to play professionally, the overwhelming majority of countries have struggled to field teams that can legitimately compete with the five or so best teams in the world. The new event also would give countries that have not had a chance to host a FIFA-branded event the opportunity to hold one, something that plays well for Infantino as he prepares to run for a second term. Infantino needs the support of the majority of the organization’s 211 member nations next year to retain his post, and as he quietly campaigns he has been busy creating or expanding events to woo nations considered to be at soccer’s furthest outposts. In February, for instance, FIFA arranged a summit meeting in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Infantino discussed tentative plans for the women’s competition there, without providing details. Those may emerge from this week’s FIFA meetings in Colombia. “We are also thinking of creating a world women’s football league so that all federations can participate, because we should not lose sight of the fact that 50 percent of the world’s population is female,” Infantino said at the meeting in Mauritania, according to news reports. Like his now disgraced predecessor, Sepp Blatter, who relied on African support for his near two-decade run as president, Infantino has devoted significant time to cultivating the region’s soccer bosses. But the new women’s tournaments also are in line with promises the 47-year-old Infantino made when he won the FIFA presidency in 2016. He said then a greater focus needed to be given to the women’s game, and he first mentioned the possibility of a new event to supplement the Women’s World Cup at FIFA’s Congress in Bahrain last year. FIFA also has taken note of the growth of tournaments like the United States-hosted She Believes Cup, a four-nation tournament that just completed its third year, and the longer-running Algarve Cup in Portugal. FIFA officials believe adding the governing body’s branding and support to the new event would attract greater sponsor and fan interest, though some women’s soccer advocates fear it risks cannibalizing those existing events. The question is whether an annual, FIFA-branded women’s league with national teams will make the quadrennial tournaments less special. Also, members briefed on the plans for the women’s game have not been provided with any financial projections for the tournament, or a commercial strategy. While FIFA has made women’s soccer a focus, there remains much work to be done on developing a strategy for the game. Some of FIFA’s financing requirements for national federations require them to operate a women’s program, though how that works as part of an overall strategy is unclear. Many nations — notably the United States, Canada and a host of countries in western Europe — have made significant investments in the women’s game, but in broad swaths of Africa, Asia and South America, and even in soccer powerhouses like Italy and Spain, it often remains an afterthought. FIFA expanded the Women’s World Cup to 24 teams from 16 for the 2015 edition in Canada, and under Infantino it already has agreed to expand the men’s World Cup to 48 teams from its current 32 from the 2026 edition. Similar changes are part of new formats for youth tournaments that will also be discussed at the FIFA Council meeting in Bogotá. Council members will be asked to agree to scrap longstanding biennial Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups in favor of a new Under-18 event to be played annually. The number of teams would be increased to 48, and the tournament, in keeping with Infantino’s effort to include member federations in more events, would be played in multiple countries. Similar expansion proposals for women’s youth tournaments will be considered, too. The council also is expected to discuss plans for an expanded 24-team Club World Cup, to be played every four years instead of annually, that would feature a minimum of 10 European teams. It is unlikely any decision would be made on that plan amid requests from European soccer officials for more discussion about the project. The tournament, if approved, would replace the Confederations Cup, the struggling tuneup event staged one year before the World Cup. It’s unclear whether Infantino will be able to push through all of the changes at the speed he desires, with some seniors soccer officials privately suggesting that he is trying to make too many changes too quickly, and without adequate consultation. To gather information and opinions, Infantino and his close aides traveled the world hosting summits in at least a dozen cities. The most recent one took place in Lima, Peru, earlier this week.",The New York Times
2018,FX Prevails in ‘Feud’ Defamation Suit Filed by Olivia de Havilland,"In a closely watched legal battle with the potential for far-reaching consequences in the film and television industry, a California appellate court on Monday dismissed a defamation lawsuit brought by the 101-year-old actress Dame Olivia de Havilland against FX Networks. Ms. de Havilland had objected to her portrayal in the Ryan Murphy-produced 2017 docuseries, “Feud: Bette and Joan,” about the volatile relationship shared by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. She is played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Her lawsuit, filed last June, was on multiple fronts, including that she did not consent to the use of her likeness in the show and that her portrayal is inaccurate, especially a scene where she is shown referring to her sister, Joan Fontaine, as a “bitch.” “Books, films, plays and television shows often portray real people,” the court decision reads. “Some are famous and some are just ordinary folks. Whether a person portrayed in one of these expressive works is a world-renowned film star — ‘a living legend’ — or a person no one knows, she or he does not own history.” FX tried to have the lawsuit tossed last summer, on the grounds of California’s anti-Slapp (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute, designed to quickly set aside lawsuits that may be designed to chill free speech. But a trial judge surprised legal observers by ruling that Ms. de Havilland had sufficient grounds to proceed with her lawsuit. Even so, Ms. de Havilland’s case still faced an uphill climb. She had the Screen Actors Guild behind her, but the Motion Picture Association of America and Netflix (which signed Mr. Murphy to a production deal said to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars) filed an amicus brief in support of FX. “The reversal is a victory for the creative community, and the First Amendment,” Mr. Murphy said in a statement to Variety. “Today’s victory gives all creators the breathing room necessary to continue to tell important historical stories inspired by true events. Most of all, it’s a great day for artistic expression and a reminder of how precious our freedom remains.”",The New York Times
2018,"Facebook Blocks Britain First, a Far-Right Anti-Muslim Group Promoted by Trump","Facebook said Wednesday that it had taken down several pages associated with “Britain First,” a far-right group whose leaders were recently convicted of hate crimes and whose inflammatory anti-Muslim videos President Trump shared with the world late last year. The social network said that the pages of Britain First and its leaders, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, had repeatedly violated community standards with posts that boasted of Islamophobia, incited hateful anti-Muslim comments and compared Muslim immigrants to animals. After the administrators of the pages failed to heed a final warning to abide by Facebook’s standards, the company took the fringe group’s pages down. “We do not do this lightly, but they have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups, which disqualifies the Pages from our service,” Facebook said. The Britain First Facebook page had about two million followers around the world. Facebook said that while it remains an open platform for all ideas and political speech, a wide range of views can and should be expressed “without needing to denigrate others on the basis of who they are.” Britain First, a Christian nationalist group estimated to have about 1,000 members, has used inflammatory tactics like confronting Muslims on the street and entering mosques to spread its belief that Islam is destroying Britain. In November, it got an unexpected boost from President Trump, who helped to promote its message by sharing with his tens of millions of Twitter followers three videos Ms. Fransen, the deputy leader, had posted on her own account. One video was titled “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” but featured an assailant who was not, in fact, a “Muslim migrant.” The other two, titled “Muslim destroys a statue of Virgin Mary!” and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” were several years old and included no context. Before Mr. Trump retweeted those videos, no modern American president had amplified inflammatory content of that nature from an extremist organization. Mr. Golding, Britain First’s leader, and Ms. Fransen were both convicted last week on counts of religiously aggravated harassment stemming from videos they posted online. Mr. Golding was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison while Ms. Fransen was sentenced to 36 weeks. The videos, from May, showed Ms. Fransen knocking on doors that she believed — incorrectly, according to prosecutors — were hiding the Muslim defendants in a rape trial. She insulted the men and challenged them to come out. Facebook and other social networks have come under increased scrutiny in recent months amid rising concern about the proliferation of hate speech and conspiracy theories online.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Facebook Doesn’t Get It,"David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The election of Donald Trump was so shocking — and damaging to the country — that many people went looking for a scapegoat. There was a long list of candidates. Hillary’s flawed campaign. Bernie’s long campaign. The Electoral College. The media. Sexist voters. Racist voters. Economically anxious voters. Nonvoters. James Comey. Anthony Weiner. Vladimir Putin. Twitter. And Facebook. By spreading false news stories and giving a megaphone to Russian trolls, Facebook — a vastly larger social network than Twitter — played a meaningful role in the presidential campaign. Of course, so did many other suspects on the list. There was no single factor that allowed Trump to win. It was a confluence. If anything, the role of Facebook and its executives has sometimes been exaggerated. “Whatever role they played surely pales in relative importance to a whole host of other factors,” Ben Thompson, the author of the Stratechery blog, pointed out yesterday (in his subscriber-only newsletter), “and it makes sense that Facebook executives would feel persecuted on that front.” But, as Thompson explains, “The problem comes when arguing about details results in missing the big picture: fake news on Facebook may not have been the deciding factor many think it was, but Facebook’s effect on the news surely mattered.” And Facebook’s executives have indeed missed this big picture, claiming that their company played no significant role in Trump’s victory. That’s simply wrong, and the company’s defensiveness is one reason that its image problems are becoming significant. Facebook, as Vox’s Emily Stuart wrote yesterday, “is under siege from lawmakers, regulators, users, shareholders, and even its own employees amid revelations that Cambridge Analytics, a data analytics firm used by the Trump campaign in the 2016 election, secretly harvested personal data from 50 million of its users.” In a 2014 speech, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s C.E.O., said, “In every single thing we do, we always put people first.” By that, he said he meant that Facebook would give people “control over how they share their information.” Facebook didn’t do that. “Where is Mark Zuckerberg?” asks Recode’s Kurt Wagner. “Facebook has dealt with these kinds of firestorms before,” Wagner writes. “But this time feels different. Users are fed up. Politicians are fed up. And investors are clearly concerned: Facebook just had its worst two-day stock performance since 2012, the year the company IPO’d. It has lost more than $50 billion off its market cap.” “It’s time” for Zuckerberg and other top Facebook officials “to come and testify,” Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said yesterday. Meanwhile, at the White House ... “This is depressing,” Matt Glassman of Georgetown University tweeted, referring to the story about Trump ignoring his national security advisers and cozying up to Putin on a phone call. “But boy, think about the atmosphere at the WH that leads to stuff like this leaking. Toxic.” In The Times. Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, is an astute observer of China, and I recommend his new op-ed on Xi Jinping.",The New York Times
2018,Facebook Employees in an Uproar Over Executive’s Leaked Memo,"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook employees were in an uproar on Friday over a leaked 2016 memo from a top executive defending the social network’s growth at any cost — even if it caused deaths from a terrorist attack that was organized on the platform. In the memo, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, wrote, “Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.” Mr. Bosworth and Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have since disavowed the memo, which was published on Thursday by BuzzFeed News. But the fallout at the Silicon Valley company has been wide. According to two Facebook employees, workers have been calling on internal message boards for a hunt to find those who leak to the media. Some have questioned whether Facebook has been transparent enough with its users and with journalists, said the employees, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation. Many are also concerned over what might leak next and are deleting old comments or messages that might come across as controversial or newsworthy, they said. The brouhaha follows a period of intense scrutiny for Facebook and questions over what its responsibilities are to its more than 2.2 billion users. The company has been grappling this month with revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested data from 50 million of the social network’s users. Mr. Zuckerberg has since been on an apology tour over data privacy and is expected to testify before lawmakers in Washington. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment over employees’ reaction to the leaked memo. In the aftermath, some Facebook executives have taken to Twitter for a public charm offensive, sending pithy phrases and emoticons to reporters who cover the company. Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s head of news feed, in recent days wrote unprompted to a BuzzFeed editor and to its chief executive reminiscing and telling a story about his mother. He also wrote to a reporter from the Verge tech site about the songs played at his wedding reception. In some of his tweets, Mr. Mosseri also defended Facebook. When writers from Vox and BuzzFeed tweeted that they noticed that stories critical of Facebook were receiving surprisingly low levels of traffic on Facebook, Mr. Mosseri jumped in. “We 100% do not take any action on stories for being critical of us,” he tweeted. Mr. Bosworth, the author of the 2016 memo, also took to Twitter. Late Thursday, he said he did not agree with what he wrote in the memo “and I didn’t agree with it even when I wrote it.” He added that “the purpose of this post, like many others I have written internally, was to bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion with the broader company.” After BuzzFeed published the memo, Mr. Bosworth deleted it from an internal message board where it had originally been posted. In a statement to BuzzFeed, Mr. Zuckerberg praised Mr. Bosworth as “a talented leader who says many provocative things” and said that he and most people at Facebook did not agree with the memo and that the company had realized that it could not just be about connecting people. Facebook employees said on Friday that discussions were raging across the company regarding the merits of the post. Some called for executives to aggressively pursue action against those leaking to the media, said two Facebook employees, as well as for the company to do more to screen for potential whistle-blowers during the hiring process. At least one former Facebook employee, Alec Muffett, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Bosworth’s memo was responsible for his decision to leave the company. “Between overwork and leadership direction evidenced thusly, I could never stay,” wrote Mr. Muffett, who formerly worked as a Facebook engineer. “There are some amazing engineers working at Facebook, folks who care deeply about user privacy, security, and how people will use the code that they write,” Mr. Muffett said later in a message. “Alas this episode may not help” to achieve more transparent internal product discussion, he said. An earlier version of this article misstated Adam Mosseri’s position at Facebook. He is the head of news feed, not the head of news.",The New York Times
2018,Facebook Exit Hints at Dissent on Handling of Russian Trolls,"As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation, an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive. The impending exit of that executive — Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer — reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter. Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said. Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said. Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company. ■ More about how Cambridge Analytica collected Facebook data. ■ The growing outcry on two continents over Facebook’s role in misuse of data. The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism. One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter. “The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people. Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans. Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure. Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.” Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said. By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.” In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company. Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees. A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular. Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.” But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied. By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate. In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.” And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube. The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017. Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.” “Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.” Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct. By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees. Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference. Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident. After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them. Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content. “I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust,’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.” ■ Cambridge Analytica executives were caught on video offering to entrap clients’ opponents. ■ How Cambridge Analytica harvested Facebook data.

2018,Facebook Faces Growing Pressure Over Data and Privacy Inquiries,"WASHINGTON — Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook. Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before them. Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about $50 billion in the past two days. They are all focused on the same thing: whether Facebook mishandled users’ data. Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users, selling advertisements based on their ages, interests and other details. But the scrutiny over the company’s vast trove of personal data — following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users — is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula. “Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation,” said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. “The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems.” So far, most of the social network’s top executives have been silent. Mr. Zuckerberg, its founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, his top deputy, have not made any public statements in recent days. The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park, Calif., where the company is based. At the meeting, employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The firm, which was tied to President Trump’s 2016 campaign, used the data to target messages to voters. The meeting, which included Facebook’s deputy counsel, Paul Grewal, largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers, according to Facebook employees in attendance. Mr. Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday, when the company holds an all-hands meeting. The company has faced internal dissent over its broader role in spreading disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it. The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, who plans to leave in August. The pressure on Facebook has been building for years. It started in the European Union, where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region’s 500 million people. The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them. After the 2016 presidential campaign, lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics, citing the company’s role in Russia’s disinformation efforts. The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news, and the company’s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future. The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers. The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users. The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry. The F.T.C. investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third-party apps on the social media site, like games, would not be allowed to access their data. But the apps, the agency found, were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user. The current investigation has parallels. The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher, Aleksandr Kogan. Mr. Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends. Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time. Then, Mr. Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica, a firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House political adviser, and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor. Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook’s policies, the company said last week. “There are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here,” said David Vladeck, a former director of consumer protection at the F.T.C. The company could face fines of $40,000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement. “We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,” an F.T.C. spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday. “We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.” Facebook said it expected to receive questions from the F.T.C. related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree. “We remain strongly committed to protecting people’s information,” Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said in a statement. “We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.” The F.T.C. inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash. On Tuesday, the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states. New Jersey’s attorney general announced a similar investigation. Mr. Schneiderman and Ms. Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica. “Consumers have a right to know how their information is used — and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users’ personal information,” Mr. Schneiderman said. “Today’s demand letter is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened.” There have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica. Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to hold a hearing. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, organized by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mr. Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties. “It’s time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other C.E.O.s to testify before Congress,” Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Tuesday. “The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election.” Facebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee, and the offices of members of other committees, including Commerce, this week. “The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third-party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,” Mr. Thune said in his letter. On Tuesday morning, a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company’s connection to Cambridge Analytica. The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr. Zuckerberg. “The committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent,” wrote Damian Collins, chairman of the British committee. “Your officials’ answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the committee.”",The New York Times
2018,"Facebook Falls From Grace, and Investors’ Stock Holdings Tumble Too","Common Sense Over the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections. By the end of last year, Facebook had 2.2 billion active users. Its stock rose 53 percent last year, single-handedly accounting for 3.7 percent of the 21.8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, according to S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. By early February, its market capitalization had surpassed $560 billion, making it the fifth most valuable company in the index. By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds. Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a “buy” in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.) It was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, “priced for perfection.” Whatever else can be said about Facebook’s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection. After revelations that data harvested from Facebook may have been used to try to influence Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the United States presidential election, the social network giant faces multiple investigations in both Europe and the United States, along with potentially profit-crimping regulations and limits to its use of data. And investor retribution has been swift. Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.) With Facebook’s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks — Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google — and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak. “People who own an index fund need to realize how important Facebook is, and how big a role it and the FANG stocks played in the market’s rise,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior industry analyst for the S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, who oversees statistical analysis for the S.&P. 500. “The FANG leadership is faltering. Social media hasn’t faced much regulation, and now there’s a cloud hanging over those companies.” In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a “sell” recommendation for Facebook last fall. So did Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group who covers media and internet companies. Although he was positive about the stock for most of its long climb, he downgraded Facebook to “sell” last summer based on regulatory and advertiser concerns and what he now considers “systemic management issues.” Not only was it a lonely position, but “the stock went up and up,” Mr. Wieser told me this week. “But I thought the market was wrong, full stop.” “I didn’t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,” he said. “There are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.” Then, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was “the most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.” “Most people hadn’t given much thought to how their data is used,” he added. “But this really exposed the potential abuse. This is digital advertising’s original sin, and there’s going to be a reckoning that even now I don’t think most investors fully appreciate.” The other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo — whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey — wasn’t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera’s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia’s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.) Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook. That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell. When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. “Aiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,” Mr. Sena said. “But it’s not meant to supplant human judgments.” He hasn’t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. “The conventional wisdom was that people don’t care that much about how their data is used,” Mr. Sena said. “They like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.’’ “Facebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,’’ he added. “I believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it’s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.” Even so, Facebook’s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out. When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser’s price target was $152. “I don’t want to be trigger happy on this,” he said. “It’s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.” Aiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn’t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a “buy” or “overweight” recommendation, up from 39 a month ago. Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn’t changed his price target of $230. “People are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,” he said. Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it “the cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,” he said. “There’s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook’s chief executive.

2018,Facebook Introduces Central Page for Privacy and Security Settings,"Facebook said it would roll out a centralized system for its users to control their privacy and security settings in response to an outcry over the way it has handled personal data. The system, which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks, will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform. From the new page, users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them, such as their political preferences or interests, and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them. Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information. Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people, leading to a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism. “The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.” The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years, with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month, people familiar with the decision have said. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings. “One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data,” he told The New York Times last week. “Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar. Late Wednesday, Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers. These are business-to-business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits, health concerns, income range and preferred credit card. The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian, Acxiom and Oracle’s Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users. But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option, called “Partner Categories.” ”We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,” Graham Mudd, a product marketing director at Facebook, said in a statement. “This product enables third-party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook,” he added. “While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook.” In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law “to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers.” How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook’s data privacy practices was unclear. Some privacy advocates noted, for instance, that the company’s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past. “The platform made similar promises many times before,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society. She pointed out that in 2010, Mr. Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would “add privacy controls that are much simpler to use.” Yet eight years later, the same concerns have resurfaced, Ms. Tufekci said. “The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C.E.O.,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Facebook Isn’t Just Violating Our Privacy,"Op-Ed Contributor Even as it issues full-page apologies in print newspapers promising ritualistically “to do better,” Facebook and its allies have minimized the importance of the seismic revelation that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on behalf of the Trump campaign in 2016, had gained access to the private information of about 50 million Facebook users. Some executives have pointed out that the mechanism that until a few years ago allowed a researcher with 270,000 app downloads to have access to 50 million profiles wasn’t exactly a secret, and, besides, Facebook users nominally agreed to the sharing of these profiles so that apps would perform better. The company’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, took to Twitter to complain that Facebook and other “platforms” were being held to a double standard concerning the profiles, since they may well “have been criticized as monopolists for locking them down.” Others poured cold water on the idea that Cambridge Analytica was able to use these profiles as grist for its research on swaying voters by cracking the code of human intention. Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and a Facebook board member, doesn’t tweet anymore, but he “likes” hundreds of tweets a week, a group that recently included a string that mocked the public’s fear that new media forms can be turned into “weapons of total mind control.” Perhaps these are the wrong reasons for outrage, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be outraged. What Facebook is selling to political campaigns is the same thing Uber is selling to its drivers and customers and what YouTube is selling to advertisers who hope to reach an audience of children — namely, the right to bypass longstanding rules and regulations in order to act with impunity. When you look at the Facebook data leak scandal this way, you realize that Facebook’s irresponsibility isn’t merely an abuse of a personal relationship — what its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us” — but also an abuse of a civic relationship. Selling relief from government scrutiny of elections is a different kind of threat to the social fabric than selling relief from government scrutiny of commerce, especially in light of our country’s record of denying voting rights to African-Americans. Facebook can’t be allowed to be a tool for enemies of democracy because it fears that regulation could hurt its bottom line. What was valuable about allowing a presidential campaign to evade regulation? Well, to start, we know that Facebook, unlike a small-market TV station, didn’t care about Russians buying political ads, even when they paid in rubles. That’s a shock to our political system, which is meant to protect against foreign interference. But more menacing is the prospect that the Trump campaign and its allies may have been given free license by Facebook to suppress African-American turnout through “dark ad posts” that disappeared after viewing. Shortly before the election, a senior official with the Trump campaign bragged to the Bloomberg reporters Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg, “We have three major voter suppression operations underway,” which the article described as targeting “idealistic white liberals, young women, and African-Americans.” Brad Parscale, who ran the Trump campaign’s digital advertising, is quoted in the same piece discussing his plan to use dark ad posts of an animation of Hillary Clinton referring in 1996 to some African-Americans as “super predators.” Parscale suggested that the campaign would use this image to discourage a demographic category described by the reporters as infrequent black voters in Florida. “Only the people we want to see it, see it,” he explained. “It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.” Some of the dark Facebook ads, bought by suspected Russian fronts, have been released as part of congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and these include an ad meant to depress black support for Hillary Clinton by referring to conspiracy theories involving her husband. What other dark Facebook ads might have been placed on behalf of the Trump campaign to suppress black turnout? Were there classic examples of voter suppression, like publishing the wrong Election Day date or falsely warning that you can be arrested at your polling place if you owe payment on a traffic ticket? We don’t know — the dark ads have disappeared and Facebook won’t release them, citing the privacy of its advertisers. Facebook’s vast and well-designed platform offered the Trump campaign and its supporters cheap, direct access to African-American voters — and along with this the chance to mislead and intimidate. In the past, candidates intent on suppressing the black vote ran up against technological barriers. They had to work with fliers and obscure radio ads, since reputable media outlets, unlike Facebook, tended to push back against racially inflammatory, untrue political advertising. Fliers and radio ads leave a public residue, too. The election of 2016, the first after Barack Obama’s presidency, was notable for a seven-percentage-point decrease in African-American turnout, from 66.6 percent in 2012 to 59.6 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. This was the first decline in 20 years in a presidential election and the largest ever recorded. The 2016 turnout rate was also below even the rate for the 2004 election, when John Kerry was the Democratic candidate. At a hearing with the top lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota began by emphasizing the stakes involved. “I come at this with the simple idea that our democracy was formed to be self-governing,” she said, adding that American citizens have “a right of freedom to make their own decisions — and I think that was interfered with by Russians and also others.” This simple idea of the United States as a self-governing community wasn’t the focus of the many mea culpa interviews Mr. Zuckerberg gave after reports of the data breach. He was focused on the individual. “A lot of the most sensitive issues that we faced today are conflicts between our real values, right?” he said in an interview with Recode. “Freedom of speech and hate speech and offensive content. Where is the line, right?” Todd A. Cox, the director of policy of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, sees the question of our “real values” a bit differently. “There has been a lot of agonizing and struggling over the place of First Amendment,” he told me. “I would like the discussion to turn on what role does the 14th Amendment, the Voting Rights Act, 15th Amendment play” — the guarantees of equal protection under the law and of the right of African-Americans to vote. That is, in addition to Facebook’s libertarian, Silicon Valley perspective that sees only the personal questions — my right to say what I want, my privacy — we must consider the collective questions: How do we protect historically discriminated groups? How do first we make sure everyone is able to speak through free, fair elections before we argue about what they can say? This week, Facebook delayed the release of its home assistant devices and unveiled yet another attempt to make its privacy settings clear and easy to use. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed,” Facebook’s chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, and deputy general counsel, Ashlie Beringer, said in a statement announcing the new privacy system. Facebook is insistent on seeing its failures as harming individuals, never society as a whole. The legal scholar Alexander Bickel was fond of saying, “No answer is what the wrong question begets.” Facebook has been asking the wrong question consistently for more than a decade, which is why its privacy scandals can seem like the longest running show in Silicon Valley. Recent events have offered us a chance to reframe the question about how to fix Facebook. It is one that all Americans should have a voice in answering.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Facebook Leaves Its Users’ Privacy Vulnerable,"Editorial Facebook is once again struggling with revelations that manipulative characters exploited the vulnerabilities of its platform during the 2016 election to put Donald Trump in the White House. The company said last week that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked for the Trump campaign, and a professor, Aleksandr Kogan, who is said to have deceptively amassed information from more than 50 million people without their consent. That may sound like decisive action, but it came more than two years after Facebook learned of the problem. Starting in 2014, Mr. Kogan got the data, using a quiz app, under the guise of academic research. He handed the information to Cambridge Analytica, which used it to build profiles of voters’ personalities, according to reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London on Saturday. What is particularly disturbing about this case is that Facebook has not yet identified and alerted users whose profile information was vacuumed up by the app, most of whom had never used it but were friends with somebody else who had. Further, Facebook did not verify that Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan deleted the data after the social media company told them to in 2015. The Times reported that Cambridge still had most or all of the data. Facebook’s response so far is reminiscent of its slow, defensive reaction to the spread of pro-Trump fake news on its platform during the 2016 presidential campaign. Days after the election, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said it was a “pretty crazy idea” to suggest that fake news had influenced the outcome. It took months for him to admit that he was wrong to so cavalierly dismiss the importance of hoaxes spread on Facebook, many of them by people working on behalf of the Russian government. It is hard to know just how useful the profile information from Facebook was in Cambridge’s effort to help elect Mr. Trump. The company has offered contradictory statements about its use of what’s called “psychographic data” for the campaign, which included targeting political messages to voters receptive to them. The trove contained enough details about roughly 30 million people, including where they lived, that the company was able to build detailed profiles by linking the data to other sources of information. Officials in the United States and the European Union are investigating Cambridge Analytica, and others say they might, including members of Congress and the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey. In Britain, regulators and lawmakers are looking at whether the company tried to illegally influence the “Brexit” referendum of 2016. More investigations may be on the way. On Monday, Channel 4 News in Britain released hidden-camera tapes in which Cambridge executives said that their company used bribes and prostitutes to entrap politicians. The company denies engaging in corruption and extortion. Robert Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who is a big supporter of Mr. Trump, owns a controlling stake in Cambridge, and Stephen Bannon, the former chief strategist for the president, is a former company board member. Lawmakers and regulators also ought to investigate Facebook’s response. For starters, they need to take a close look at whether the company is in violation of a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused it of deceiving users by telling them their information would be kept private and then allowing it to be shared and made public. They also need to force the company to quickly identify and alert the tens of millions of people whose information might have been disclosed to Cambridge. In the longer term, Congress clearly needs to strengthen privacy laws to give people more control over private information and prevent businesses and political campaigns from harvesting personal data under false pretenses. President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights in 2012, but the idea died in Congress after technology and advertising companies claimed it would be an unfair burden. Facebook says it takes this case seriously. But it is clear that lawmakers cannot rely on the company to police itself. OpinionMichelle Goldberg OpinionZeynep Tufekci",The New York Times
2018,Facebook Lets Ads Bare a Man’s Chest. A Woman’s Back Is Another Matter. ,"Advertisers, especially smaller ones, complain of inconsistency and gender bias in the process that determines whether images are rejected for being sexually suggestive. When Krista Venero, an author who writes under the pen name K.L. Montgomery, bought ads on Facebook for a romance novel she published last year, she thought her marketing fell well within the bounds of the social network’s policies. The ad showed an image of a woman photographed from behind with a portion of her upper back exposed. It didn’t seem particularly racy, certainly no more than an ad for Olay body wash, showing a woman’s bare back and legs, that Ms. Venero had recently seen. Facebook rejected her ad, however, and when she disputed the decision, a representative told her that it implied nudity and that the company did not allow ads “with a sexual undertone.” Facebook now says it incorrectly rejected Ms. Venero’s ad, but the back and forth is an example of the social network’s struggles over images of the human body. More precisely, as Facebook processes millions of ads a week through a mix of automation and human review, what is acceptable and what isn’t, and who is making those decisions? Ms. Venero now tends to make her ads “extremely conservative, she said. “They usually just have a man and woman’s face on them,” she added. “I do have one that has a man’s chest, and I’ve never had any problems with it. But a woman’s shoulder — we have a problem.” Ms. Venero is not the only one to complain that Facebook is inconsistent when deciding which images are sexually suggestive, particularly pictures of women. The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man’s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to “steamy romance novels” called Beyond 50 Shades. That image, in which the man had his thumb on the inside of his pants, was incorrectly approved, a Facebook spokeswoman recently said. April Ray, who helps run a book blog, Reading After Dark, was alarmed late last year when a photo of her was flagged as adult content. Ms. Ray was using the picture, which showed her reading in a dark room in a black T-shirt, as part of a promotion for the blog’s Facebook page. “It definitely stung a little because it was my profile picture and I’ve had it for three years now, and it’s just my face — I’m wearing a regular T-shirt that I think I got at the Gap,” Ms. Ray said. She said it had taken several days for her appeal to reach a person at Facebook. The photo was then approved, but it was too late for a contest her blog was running. Facebook’s ad practices have long been scrutinized, even more so after 13 Russians were indicted in February on charges that they tried to disrupt the 2016 presidential election by, among other things, distributing divisive ads through the social network. But the disputes raised by Ms. Venero and Ms. Ray are indicative of questions raised by smaller advertisers, who rely on Facebook to market their work but often have to navigate the appeals process themselves. Facebook prohibits adult content in ads, including “depictions of people in explicit or suggestive positions” and “activities that are overly suggestive or sexually provocative.” The rules also extend to “implied nudity,” “excessive visible skin” and images that are too focused on individual body parts “even if not explicitly sexual in nature.” On Facebook’s website, all of the examples showed women. “Facebook’s policies have the effect of sexualizing women’s bodies in a way that is not necessary and very unhealthy for society,” said Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates digital privacy protections. She added that while the company allowed topless men, it took a strict approach to nudity of a female torso. Joel Jones, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions operations, said that the company tended to be “conservative” when monitoring ads that people might find offensive but that its enforcement of adult content did not distinguish between men and women. Human reviewers are trained with examples that feature both men and women, Mr. Jones said, and he noted that more women appeared in ads — almost twice as often as men in a sampling during the previous 30 days. For advertisers, debating what constitutes “adult content” with those human reviewers can be frustrating. Goodbye Bread, an edgy online retailer for young women, said it had a heated debate with Facebook in December over the image of young woman modeling a leopard-print mesh shirt. Facebook said the picture was too suggestive. When Goodbye Bread challenged the decision, and a company representative replied that the issue was the policy against ads “that show a lot of skin.” “The shirt is considerably transparent in the fact that the breast would be visible had it not been blurred,” the representative said, adding that as a result, the nudity was “implied.” When presented with the email exchange by The New York Times, a Facebook spokeswoman said that the image did not violate its policies on adult content and that the company had sent “incorrect messaging” to Goodbye Bread. The post, the spokesperson said, actually violated a separate policy involving profanity because of another image in the same ad. George Stamelos, a co-founder of Goodbye Bread, said fashion brands regularly dealt with mixed messages from Facebook on skin and suggestiveness in ads but could often successfully appeal to human moderators. He also said Facebook’s policies were unfairly applied to women. “I get bombarded with stupid ads for swimwear and stuff like that — every guy is topless with a six pack, and they don’t have a problem with that,” Mr. Stamelos said. “During the summer, we couldn’t advertise our swimwear collection on Facebook because we kept getting rejected for excessive skin.” It’s sticky territory for a company of Facebook’s size, particularly when there is intense scrutiny on gender inequality. It also raises questions about who, at a company where just 35 percent of the employees are women, is deciding what’s suggestive. Facebook declined to give rough estimates of how many people work on reviewing and approving ads or say where they are. In October, the company announced it was hiring 1,000 additional people to review ads in the wake of congressional hearings that examined the role Facebook played in helping spread disinformation during the 2016 election, including the impact of Russian political ads purchased on Facebook. Mr. Jones of Facebook said the company set higher standards for ads than for regular posts from users because ads were “proactively pushed out to people.” He said Facebook was “focused on improving our review protocols and automated systems.” Facebook, which counts more than two billion users worldwide, has frequently been accused of taking a conservative, and at times haphazard, approach to what types of nudity it finds acceptable. In 2008, women began noticing that their photos of breast-feeding were being removed from personal posts as well as from private groups where women shared advice and tips on how to nurse their babies. Critics of Facebook have since argued that its policies against showing female nipples harm health initiatives that encourage breast-feeding. In 2016, the company was criticized for censoring a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a young girl running naked after a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. Facebook rescinded its decision, saying, “In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image.” Mr. Stamelos said he hoped Facebook would reconsider how it applied its policies to women and men, adding that he had seen the company take a harder line on its appeals recently. “This is extremely problematic, especially considering the magnitude of Facebook’s reach,” he said. Ms. Venero, the author, never got a response from Facebook about why her ad was rejected and the body wash ad was approved, she said. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company could not ask an automated system about those decisions. “I understand they have to prohibit content that really is disturbing,” Ms. Venero said. “But whatever their algorithms are that do this, or the humans in their department that look at these ads — they just aren’t consistent with it.”",The New York Times
2018,Facebook Made Him a Billionaire. Now He’s a Critic.,"As Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism, even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries. Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week, as a creator of one of Facebook’s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant. “It is time. #deletefacebook,” wrote Brian Acton, one of the founders of WhatsApp, wrote on Twitter. His company was bought by Facebook for $19 billion in 2014. The deal made him a billionaire. Mr. Acton’s anti-Facebook message, retweeted more than 10,000 times, captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best-known people are publicly calling for change. The chorus has grown louder this week, as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain data on 50 million users. “The question is, ‘What are you loyal to?’” said Tristan Harris, a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology, an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture. He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions. “Are you more loyal to your company,” Mr. Harris said. “Or are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society?” The tech defections have accelerated in recent months, especially for Facebook. Justin Rosenstein, the creator of the Facebook “like” button, deleted the product from his phone and spoke out about the industry using psychologically manipulative advertising. Chamath Palihapitiya, Facebook’s former head of user growth, said in December that the company was “ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.” And Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook platform operations manager, wrote on Tuesday in The Washington Post that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, must “be held accountable for the negligence of his company.” Loyalty to a company is beginning to crack because many tech workers are being asked to build or defend products they question, Mr. Harris said. His center is making resources for engineers on how to build more ethical products and starting an educational campaign, called “The Truth About Tech,” in 55,000 American schools. “More people are speaking up because they feel like they’ve been told lies,” Mr. Harris said. “You can’t just repeat, ‘We’re making the world more open’ over and over and over again while democracy is burning.” Silicon Valley companies have long prized secrecy and loyalty among their workers, who often exercise, play sports and eat three meals a day together. Facebook especially is known for its tight-knit community. Each employee has an annual “Faceversary” on his or her hire date, a ritual that within the company is seen as deeply meaningful and is usually accompanied by balloons. “Until very recently, it was taken as a given that tech equaled progress and tech equaled good and tech equaled economic strength,” said Leslie Berlin, the author of Troublemakers, a history of Silicon Valley. She said the defections she sees now are historically unique. “The Valley was founded on this notion of, ‘We’re very open,’ ” Ms. Berlin said. “But the secrecy has always been there.” “It’s been pretty much a straight line since the start of the Cold War until now,” she said. “This is something new.” Employees may feel the freedom to rebel because of Silicon Valley’s success, both technologically and financially. The technology platforms have become more powerful — and the fortunes much bigger — than the programmers ever expected. So while the industry’s power disturbs them, the wealth allows them to speak out without fear of retribution, Ms. Berlin said. “It’s the shadow of the success,” she said. “You have to understand them together.” Certainly, not everyone is critical. Mr. Acton’s WhatsApp co-founder, Jan Koum, is on the Facebook board of directors and remains deeply active on the platform, regularly posting pro-President Trump and anti-immigration news. And when former leaders have spoken out with criticisms of Facebook, the company has often responded aggressively. “They do yell,” said Roger McNamee, an early investor and adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, referring to Facebook leadership’s approach. But the culture of fear that the company has fostered among employees is not working anymore, he said. ""Facebook is at one of those moments where everybody who works there has to ask which side of history do you want to be on,” Mr. McNamee said. “The facts are not only indisputable, they’re not even complete. It’s going to get worse.”",The New York Times
2018,Facebook Vowed to End Discriminatory Housing Ads. Suit Says It Didn’t.,"Fair housing groups filed a lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday saying that Facebook continues to discriminate against certain groups, including women, disabled veterans and single mothers, in the way that it allows advertisers to target the audience for their ads. The suit comes as the social network is scrambling to deal with an international crisis over the misuse of data belonging to 50 million of its users. Facebook, an advertising behemoth with more than two billion users a month, provides advertisers with the ability to customize their messages and target who sees them by selecting from preset lists of demographics, likes, behaviors and interests, while excluding others. Pet food companies, for example, could send their ads specifically to people who had indicated an interest in dogs, while excluding cat and bird fanciers. When it comes to housing and employment ads, Facebook, in response to criticism over the last 17 months, has repeatedly promised that it would crack down on advertisers who use those same tools to show housing or employment ads to whites only. But in the lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the National Fair Housing Alliance and affiliated groups in New York, San Antonio and Miami contend that Facebook’s advertising platform “continues to enable landlords and real estate brokers to bar families with children, women and others from receiving rental and sales ads for housing.” Diane L. Houk of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, a lawyer who worked on the lawsuit, said the groups want the court to require Facebook to take action. “We want the court to order Facebook to develop a plan to remove any ability for advertisers to access Facebook’s checklists for excluding groups of people in the posting of housing-related ads,” Ms. Houk said. “Because of Facebook’s impact on the housing market, we’ll ask the court to implement a plan of community education and outreach to housing providers to inform them of their obligation not to discriminate.” The suit says Facebook’s actions are a violation of the Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to publish housing ads that indicate preferences or limitations based on race color, religion, handicaps, familial status or national origin. “Facebook’s ability to customize an online audience for advertisements based on its vast trove of user data has made it the biggest advertising agency in the world — the advertising platform of choice for millions of businesses,” the lawsuit states. “But Facebook has abused its enormous power.” The criticisms go directly to the heart of Facebook’s business. The social network earned nearly all of its more than $40 billion in revenue in 2017 by selling ads on its network. “There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,” a Facebook spokesman said. The lawsuit is only the latest problem for Facebook. Earlier this month, Facebook became embroiled in a major crisis over the mishandling of data from 50 million users. The information was ultimately used by Cambridge Analytica, which was working on behalf of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. State and federal regulators are now assessing whether the transfer of data violated privacy agreements struck under prior consent decrees. Facebook is the subject of privacy investigations in Europe as well. As a result, the company’s stock price has swooned with investors fearing the prospect of new regulations. “Facebook is essential to the information flow that comprises our public discourse,” said Olivier Sylvain, a law professor at Fordham Law School, who is not involved in the suit. “But in that role, they should take on the responsibility of minding the flow of information, including the algorithms that produce the results.” To test its case, the National Fair Housing Alliance created an ad for a fictitious apartment rental in Washington, D.C., using Facebook’s features to exclude “corporate moms,” “stay-at-home moms” and other categories that would eliminate women from the ad’s potential audience. Facebook estimated that the ads would reach 48,000 to 820,000 people, the lawsuit said. In New York, the Fair Housing Justice Center created an ad for a rental apartment by selecting “no kids” and “men” from the inclusion list and “moms of grade school kids” and other groups from the exclusion list. Facebook estimated that the ad would reach 280,000 people. The lawsuit says that Facebook also provides “interests” categories for housing ads that permit a landlord or real estate agent to exclude users based on disability-related factors, like “Interest in Disabled Parking Permit,” or “disabled veteran,” and on the basis of national origin, by eliminating those with, say, an “Interest in Telemundo,” the Spanish language television network, or English as a second language. “The way people find housing in 2018 is radically different than when the Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968,” said Robert Schwemm, a law professor at the University of Kentucky and author of “Housing Discrimination: Law and Litigation.” But, he added, “the Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to target certain groups while excluding others.” “The courts have taken discriminatory housing ads very seriously,” he said. Some online companies accused of discrimination have cited the 1996 Communications Decency Act as a defense. That law essentially says that platforms that merely allow third parties to post material cannot be held liable for something that is discriminatory. But, Mr. Schwemm said, Facebook is another matter. “By allowing housing advertisers to click certain boxes in order to refine their ads and exclude certain protected groups, Facebook is more than just a neutral conveyor of information, like, say, a phone company, which is not liable for its customers’ discriminatory ads or statements.” ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to investigative journalism, raised the issue of discriminatory housing ads in an October 2016 article that described how advertisers could keep users who were black, Hispanic or had other “ethnic affinities” from seeing housing ads. That got the attention of the National Fair Housing Alliance, which sent a letter to Facebook saying that its ad practices appeared to violate fair-housing laws and asked for a meeting. In November 2016, Facebook said it would disable the use of “ethnic affinity marketing for ads that we identify as offering housing employment or credit.” A year ago, Facebook said its policy expressly forbid ads that have discriminatory content. But a second article by ProPublica in November found that housing ads that specifically excluded African-Americans, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews and Spanish speakers could still be placed on Facebook’s platform. The following month, an article by The New York Times and ProPublica found that national employers like Verizon, Goldman Sachs and Amazon had placed job recruitment ads limited to certain age groups, while hundreds of millions of other internet users never saw the ads. “We thought they were sincere,” said Lisa Rice, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance. “But they have not changed their content, their platform and their systems to preclude advertisers from discriminating. When you think that Facebook has over two billion active users, that’s pretty significant.”",The New York Times
2018,Facebook and Cambridge Analytica: What You Need to Know as Fallout Widens,"Our report that a political firm hired by the Trump campaign acquired access to private data on millions of Facebook users has sparked new questions about how the social media giant protects user information. Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump’s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users. The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On Monday, a British TV news report cast it in a harsher light, showing video of Cambridge Analytica executives offering to entrap politicians. A day later, as a furor grew, the company suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix. [Read more about how Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign became linked] The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads. Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned. The technique had been developed at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use. Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge. [Read more about the internal tension at the top of Facebook over the platform’s political exploitation] Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account. But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm. Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed. Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.” In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.” [Read more about how to protect your data on Facebook] Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday. ■The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent agreement to keep users’ data private. ■ In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook’s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected. ■ A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook’s ties to Cambridge Analytica. ■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post. Facebook’s lack of disclosure on the harvesting of data could violate privacy laws in Britain and several states.",The New York Times
2018,Facebook and Other Tech Companies Drag Down Stock Markets,"Stocks tumbled on Monday, dragged down by shares of technology companies, which until recently had propelled the nine-year bull market ever higher. Facebook was at the heart of the sell-off. Its shares closed down 6.8 percent after news emerged over the weekend that a political data firm with links to President Trump’s 2016 campaign had harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles. The news reports could open the door to greater government scrutiny and potential regulation of the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world’s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry’s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models. Facebook’s decline on Monday was the stock’s worst single-day fall since 2014, and it weighed on the other tech giants. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, fell more than 3 percent. Amazon and Microsoft dropped more than 1.7 percent. And Apple, the largest American company by market capitalization, sank 1.5 percent. The falling tech stocks pulled down the overall market, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index down 1.4 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.8 percent. The turbulence in the tech industry adds to the recent market turmoil. After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets, equities have been on a roller coaster since February. The volatility has been driven in large part by fears that inflation might bubble up and prompt the central banks to hike interest rates faster than expected. Since the start of the current bull market in March 2009, technology companies have delivered total returns — including the appreciation in their share prices and the dividends they have paid — of more than 570 percent, far outpacing the broader market. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S. & P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent, meaning that a swing in tech stocks has a big effect on the broader market. A few giant companies have been the driving force behind the rally. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent company — often referred to in the markets by the shorthand FANG — have become a favorite combination for stock investors.",The New York Times
2018,Facebook to End News Feed Experiment in 6 Countries That Magnified Fake News,"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook said on Thursday that it would end an experiment in six countries that separated posts from news sites and publishers from other material on the social network. News organizations in the countries — Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Bolivia, Guatemala and Serbia — had said they were blindsided by the Facebook experiment when it began in October and complained that it had led to a surprising rise in misinformation. Facebook stopped short of acknowledging that the changes made in the experiment, called Explore, contributed to that increase in misinformation, but the company said it could have done a better job communicating with publishers about what was happening. “In surveys, people told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing, and having two separate feeds didn’t actually help them connect more with friends and family,” Adam Mosseri, who heads Facebook’s News Feed, said in a statement posted online. “We also received feedback that we made it harder for people in the test countries to access important information, and that we didn’t communicate the test clearly.” Facebook and other social media companies are grappling with their role in spreading false information propagated by Russians ahead of the 2016 presidential election. And they face increasing pressure from regulators around the world to get a better handle on what happens on their networks, from misinformation to cyberbullying. Also on Thursday, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, said his company was looking for ways to measure the “health” of conversations on Twitter. In a series of tweets, Mr. Dorsey acknowledged that Twitter has been home to a number of people who use the platform to harass, bully and mislead. “We have witnessed abuse, harassment, troll armies, manipulation through bots and human-coordination, misinformation campaigns, and increasingly divisive echo chambers,” Mr. Dorsey wrote. “We aren’t proud of how people have taken advantage of our service, or our inability to address it fast enough.” After Facebook released Explore in the six countries, it was quickly criticized by independent news sites and nongovernmental organizations. The changes, they said, made it harder for trusted sources of information to reach local populations. They also said the experiment had led to an increase in false and salacious news being shared in those countries. Stuart White, editor of The Phnom Penh Post, an English-language newspaper in Cambodia, said traffic from Facebook to his site had plummeted because of the changes to Facebook’s main News Feed — the scrolling stream of content that greets people when they log into the social network. The experiment took place during a crackdown by the country’s leader, Hun Sen, on political opponents, activists and media, effectively transforming the struggling democracy into a one-party state. Journalists were arrested, and newspapers were shut down. Facebook had emerged as an important, more independent channel for information. “Whether or not Facebook likes it, it has established itself as the main market for news in places like Cambodia,” Mr. White said. “It would be helpful if they acknowledged that responsibility.” Fabiola Chambi, the web editor of Los Tiempos, the main newspaper of the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, said Explore had reduced traffic to the site by 30 to 60 percent. Ms. Chambi said the Explore function was a constant source of confusion for publishers and readers who thought their access to news had been the subject of an experiment by a foreign company. “It wasn’t an idea that was ever well received, and garnered plenty of rejection,” she said. “And I would guess this had something to do with their decision to reverse course.” However, the move did force the newspaper for the first time to think about life after Facebook. “We had to confront the declines and in the end found some creative ways to improve traffic and maintain a loyal audience,” Ms. Chambi said. Facebook’s role as a kingmaker among publishers has played a central role in a debate over the responsibilities that social media companies have to police content on their own platforms. Facebook has announced a series of changes to its News Feed as it looks to increase “meaningful interaction” on its site by drawing attention to content from family and friends while de-emphasizing content from brands and publishers. Those changes will be introduced gradually around the world. Facebook has said those News Feed changes were not related to Explore, but there are similarities in the way the company is looking to play down material from publishers. While Facebook has said it was emphasizing meaningful interactions, Mr. Dorsey said Twitter was determined to find “holistic and fair solutions” to its problems. The company recently rewrote its user rules and guidelines, and has begun punishing well-known Twitter users who violate those rules by removing their “account verification” status or barring them altogether. It was unclear how either Twitter or Facebook will measure the new method by which they said they will judge their platforms, or how they will affect the billions of people who use them.",The New York Times
2018,"Facebook, Austin, College Basketball: Your Monday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump believes he has settled into the job enough to rely on his instincts rather than on the people who work for him, according to his friends and advisers. That self-confidence surfaced over the weekend as Mr. Trump abandoned a strategy of showing deference to the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. He criticized Robert Mueller and what he characterized as a partisan investigation, leading some Republicans to warn him against shutting down the inquiry. The president also renewed attacks against former officials at the F.B.I., including “lying James Comey” and Andrew McCabe, whose firing Mr. Trump called “a great day for Democracy.” • Unusually, they responded in kind: “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” Mr. Comey wrote on Twitter, apparently referring to his upcoming book. Others used far harsher language. • Ever taken a quiz on Facebook? The social network is again defending its protection of user information after a political data firm harvested private information from more than 50 million profiles. The data was obtained in 2014, when users were paid to take a personality quiz and download an app that scraped information from their profiles and those of their friends. Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain are calling for greater scrutiny after a joint examination published over the weekend by The New York Times and The Observer of London. The report explained how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, developed voter-profiling techniques that were used in Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. • Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested, and the lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states. • Black men raised in the U.S., even in the wealthiest families, still earn less in adulthood than white men with similar backgrounds, according to a study that traced the lives of millions of children. The review, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, found that black and white women from families with comparable earnings had similar individual incomes. • The research debunks widely held hypotheses about income inequality. • After Hurricane Harvey swamped the city in August, some residents learned that the flooding in their neighborhood wasn’t an accident. Homes in Cinco Ranch sat on land that had been designed to flood, as part of a system to protect central Houston — a fact that wasn’t publicized when a developer was allowed to build there. • Our video follows several families that learned their homes should never have been built in the first place. • An American-educated economist is expected to become the next leader of China’s central bank.

In March 1957, when Elvis Presley was 22, he purchased an opulent mansion in Memphis, called Graceland, for just over $100,000. He was already a star, and at work on his second movie, “Loving You.” The land had been owned for generations by the family of S. E. Toof, a newspaper publisher, and it was named after a female relative, Grace. Grace’s niece and her husband built the mansion in 1939. Mr. Presley installed a pool with a jukebox nearby, hosted friends and relatives, and created a “Jungle Room” with green carpets and a Polynesian theme. After struggling with ill health and prescription drug abuse, he died of a heart attack at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977, and is buried there. He was 42. Read his Times obituary here. Five years later, Graceland opened to the public and became one of the country’s most popular tourist destinations (the address is 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard). Many visit yearly for the anniversary of his death. Last year, just before the 40th anniversary, Graceland underwent a $140 million expansion, including a large hotel and entertainment complex.

2018,"Facebook, John Dowd, Syria: Your Thursday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “The most important thing is that we fix this system.” Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, above, gave an unexpected interview to two of our reporters about the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Not everyone has been impressed by Mr. Zuckerberg’s response to revelations that data from over 50 million Facebook profiles had been secretly scraped and mined for voter insights. On “The Daily,” one of the reporters who interviewed Mr. Zuckerberg described how it went. (Facebook’s outreach was so sudden, they had to ask him to hold while they read his just-posted public statement.) ____ 2. President Trump’s national security adviser is out. H. R. McMaster, above, will be replaced by John R. Bolton, a hard-line former U.S. ambassador. Earlier Thursday, Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation, John Dowd, resigned after concluding that the president was increasingly ignoring his advice. And there’s a septuagenarian rumble brewing — on Twitter, at least. Earlier this week, former Vice President Joe Biden — who, at 75, may be considering a presidential bid — said that if he were younger, he would “beat the hell” out of President Trump for disrespecting women. On Thursday, Mr. Trump, 71, countered that Mr. Biden “would go down fast and hard” if the two brawled. ____ 3. President Trump announced plans to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports, in punishment for what the White House says is China’s pattern of co-opting American tech and trade secrets. The administration said the targets — 1,300 lines of goods from shoes and clothing to electronics — would be named within 15 days. Global markets shuddered as investors began to take the prospect of a trade war seriously. The measure came as the White House listed the many American allies to be exempted from steel and aluminum tariffs that go into effect on Friday. Japan wasn’t on the list. ____ 4. The Turkish government arranged a rare visit for The New York Times to a city in northern Syria under its control. Turkish officials see the town of Jarabulus as a blueprint for Afrin, which Turkish forces and their Syrian allies captured last weekend. There are functioning schools and a hospital (above, displaying the image of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey). And the Turkish presence has deterred the Syrian government from bombing the area. The victory in Afrin has emboldened Mr. Erdogan, who has vowed to continue his military campaign across northern Syria. ____ 5. Investigators are combing through mounds of evidence in Austin, Tex., trying to piece together what sent a 23-year-old white man on a bombing spree that killed two people and terrorized the state capital. Both people killed by the bombings belonged to prominent African-American families in the city, raising the specter that the violence was racially motivated. Anthony Stephan House, 39, above left, was a father and finance professional. Draylen Mason, 17, right, was a promising classical musician who died as he protected his mother from the explosion. ____ 6. Using exclusively obtained surveillance footage, we pieced together the last days of Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas gunman who rained lethal fire on a music festival last October, killing scores. He plays video poker, laughs with hotel staff members — and hauls bag after bag of weapons into his suite. Watch the video here. ____ 7. New York City’s population reached a record high: 8,622,698. The number comes from an analysis of new Census Bureau population estimates for last year, and it’s the culmination of an average annual gain not seen since the first half of the 20th century. Above, a crowded subway station. “It’s a remarkable growth story,” the city’s chief demographer said. (And while we’re talking population statistics, did you see our recent canine census?) ____ 8. The Juneau, a long-lost Navy cruiser blasted apart by a Japanese torpedo in World War II, was discovered off the coast of the Solomon Islands by a team funded by the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen. Among the hundreds who went down with the ship were the five Sullivan brothers of Waterloo, Iowa. The exact location of the wreckage was revealed to the Navy but not to the public. “These are war graves, and we want to make sure that they are not harmed,” said the head of Mr. Allen’s maritime operations. ____ 9. The latest obituary in our Overlooked series: the woman who invented the chocolate chip cookie. Ruth Wakefield’s creation was known originally as the Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie, after the popular Massachusetts restaurant she ran with her husband in the 1930s. Legend has it that she was trying a variation on a butterscotch dessert when she decided to let the chocolate chips fall where they may. As the Overlooked project started, we asked readers to suggest women they felt deserved, but didn’t get, obituaries in The Times. Here are the stories you told us about your grandmothers and great-grandmothers. ____ 10. Finally, our film critic says Wes Anderson’s new animated movie “Isle of Dogs” — set in a fantasy version of Japan where cat-fancying villains conspire to eradicate dogs — can be easier to admire than to flat-out love. But Mr. Anderson is “especially inventive,” and Manohla Dargis writes that she could watch hours of the noble canines. On the late-night shows, Trevor Noah poked fun at Mark Zuckerberg: “Things are so bad for him right now that Facebook is showing him ads for Xanax.” Have a great night. ____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

2018,"Facebook, Texas, China: Your Thursday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant’s chief executive, publicly addressed the crisis facing his company, five days after reports about the misuse of data from 50 million of its users. “We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,” he wrote in a statement outlining the steps Facebook would take to better protect users’ information. He also spoke to The Times about his plans for change. Given that the gathering of user data is fundamental to the company’s operations, lawmakers and researchers were unimpressed by Mr. Zuckerberg’s mea culpa: “He avoided the big issue, which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy,” a Columbia University researcher said. • Disillusioned Facebook users have been leaving the service. Want to delete your account? You can try. • A pair of pink construction gloves led to Mark Anthony Conditt, who the police say was responsible for a string of bombings in the Texas capital. On Wednesday, Mr. Conditt, a 23-year-old from the Austin suburbs with no criminal record, detonated one of his homemade devices and killed himself before he could be apprehended. Here’s what we know about him. • The authorities are now trying to determine a motive. They’re being helped by a 25-minute confession the suspect left on his phone. • President Trump has said the country is an “economic enemy” of the U.S. that has “taken advantage of us like nobody in history.” Today, he plans to announce tariffs on at least $50 billion of annual Chinese imports and to impose other penalties in response to the theft of technology and trade secrets. Previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will also affect China, go into effect on Friday. China’s staggering economic growth has indeed been propelled by unfair trade practices, but experts worry that the president’s go-it-alone approach undermines the potential for collective action. • On Wednesday, Mr. Trump appeared to endorse a $1.3 trillion spending deal reached by Congress. Lawmakers must approve the bill by midnight Friday to avoid a government shutdown. • President’s Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation resigned today, according to two people briefed on the matter. The lawyer, John Dowd, who took over the president’s legal team last summer, had considered leaving several times and ultimately concluded that Mr. Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice, one of the people said. • The president has said that he would agree to an interview with the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, but Mr. Dowd has said that was a bad idea. • At the request of Congress, the bureau investigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury last year, after he inaccurately said that he had no contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign, according to three people familiar with the case. Andrew McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director at the time, was said to have authorized the inquiry. Mr. McCabe was recently fired — by Mr. Sessions — for showing “lack of candor” in an internal investigation. • Separately, John Brennan, a former C.I.A. director and a pointed critic of President Trump, said that he thought Russia may have compromising information on the president. He later said that his opinion wasn’t based on inside knowledge. • Can the Federal Reserve engineer the best economy since the 1960s? Its new chairman, Jerome Powell, is going to try. The central bank raised interest rates on Wednesday and said it expected to do so twice more this year. • Time magazine, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money are up for sale. • The April 17 deadline for filing taxes is fast approaching, and many virtual currency traders are sweating over their returns. • U.S. stocks were down on Wednesday.

A scientist asked people to send her fallen feathers, like the ones shown below, so that she could map bird movements as the country’s wetlands disappear. • In praise of Grandma When we introduced the Overlooked project two weeks ago, we asked readers to suggest people they felt deserved, but didn’t get, obituaries in The Times. We’ve received close to 2,500 submissions. About 30 were from readers who told us about their grandmothers or great-grandmothers, who often fought strong institutional prejudice. Here are their stories. • The Boss remains on Broadway Bruce Springsteen’s sold-out show, “Springsteen on Broadway,” has been extended until December. The average ticket price last week was a whopping $507.60. (By comparison, the average price for “The Lion King” was $149.27.) • Best of late-night TV Trevor Noah had sympathy for Mark Zuckerberg: “Things are so bad for him right now that Facebook is showing him ads for Xanax.” • Quotation of the day “I haven’t seen all the shows, because I’m making them.” — Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, the 98-year-old chaplain for Loyola University Chicago’s men’s basketball team, on being an in-demand guest on national talk shows as her flock enters the round of 16 at the N.C.A.A. tournament. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. On this day in 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Eisenstadt v. Baird that it’s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception. The court had ruled earlier, in 1965, that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights. But a few states still restricted access for single people. Bill Baird, an activist, violated one such law in Massachusetts. He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, which struck down the law. Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people. The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court, including the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that recognized abortion rights, and, more recently, the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same-sex marriage. A movie about Mr. Baird’s case is in development. Mr. Baird has continued working as an activist, but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an “unapologetic zealotry” and a willingness to criticize “even his ideologic allies.” Planned Parenthood once called him an “embarrassment.” Jillian Rayfield contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

2018,"Facebook, Uber, Brexit: Your Tuesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Data harvesting on Facebook, a Brexit transition deal and a self-driving Uber’s first fatal accident. Here’s the latest: • Alexander Nix, above, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, the data firm hired by the Trump campaign that harvested information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles, was secretly filmed by a reporter as he offered to entrap foreign politicians with women. Britain’s information commissioner is seeking a warrant to review the firm’s data, which was collected through a third-party app on Facebook. The technical openness to engagement that helped make Facebook a juggernaut has become a privacy nightmare, our columnist writes. Here’s how you can protect your information. Facebook’s share price plummeted, and a key executive who had urged more disclosure is planning to leave. _____ • British and E.U. negotiators agreed on the terms of a 21-month Brexit transition. London conceded that E.U. citizens who arrived in Britain during the transition period would have the same rights as those already in the country. But the deal still depends on a broader agreement that is far from certain. _____ • A self-driving Uber car struck a woman, causing the first known pedestrian fatality from a driverless vehicle on a public road. While autonomous cars are expected to ultimately be safer, they face a challenge in trying to adjust for unpredictable behavior. In this case, the woman was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk. (Here is a brief guide to the way these cars operate.) _____ • Syrian propaganda videos showed President Bashar al-Assad driving a Honda from Damascus to eastern Ghouta, the suburb that has been under siege for almost five years. In bypassing the news media, Mr. Assad delivered an alternative view of the war, one in which he is assured and in charge. Separately, a young English woman’s idealism took her to Syria, and to her death. Anna Campbell, 26, died defending the Kurdish-led region of Rojava, whose leaders advocate equal rights for women. _____ • President Trump unveiled an opioid plan that includes a push for the death penalty for dealers but was vague on details. Separately, he is said to be considering reshuffling his legal team to more aggressively take on the special counsel’s Russia inquiry. At least online, intelligence agency and law enforcement targets of President Trump’s insult-laden attacks are starting to strike back, sometimes in unusually harsh terms. • Picture a leader. Most people will draw a man, not a woman. Researchers are investigating the reasons there’s such a gender gap in the recognition of leadership potential. • A European plan to tax digital companies on where they generate revenue could hit Silicon Valley giants hard. • With cheap flights becoming increasingly popular, Air France wants to let travelers know that flying doesn’t have to be a bare-bones experience. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Meet Luigi Di Maio, a 31-year-old college dropout, who may be in line to become Italy’s next prime minister.

Today, we end with a personal note: Since these briefings’ inception over a year ago, this has been the question I have been asked the most: “How do you know what Europeans want to read?” That’s a fair question for a journalist, albeit a European one, who has spent most of his adult life in Asia, and still is there. It is also a legitimate question for a U.S. newspaper at a time in which American news cycles are focused on the twists and turns of a tumultuous presidency. So, here’s what we do: Every day, we spend hours poring over correspondents’ dispatches and news reports from across Europe, from Iceland to Turkey. In conversations with editors, we seek to distill wider trends from the day-to-day politics and give you what you need to know to start your day. Of course, the result has often been a compromise. Is it flawed? Always. But that’s the rule for all early drafts of history. My last briefing is today’s. I’d like to invite you to keep reading, keep debating and keep challenging assumptions.

2018,"Facebook, Uber, Weinstein Company: Your Tuesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • More than a decade ago, Facebook opened itself to the world, inviting developers to build apps and programs on top of the social network’s platform. Millions of third-party apps have been created since then, and the consequences of Facebook’s loose approach to the collection of user data are becoming clear, our tech columnist writes. As Facebook grapples with questions about its role in the spread of disinformation, the company’s chief information security officer is said to be leaving. The executive, Alex Stamos, had pushed for more transparency but met resistance from other senior leaders, according to current and former employees. • Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm that harvested information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles, also sought to entrap politicians with sex or bribes, according to an investigation in Britain that included a journalist posing as a prospective client. • A male student opened fire at a high school in Southern Maryland today, injuring two students and exchanging gunfire with an officer at the school, the police said. The suspect was later confirmed dead. • The shooting comes just over a month after 14 students and three adults were killed at a high school in Parkland, Fla. • Last year, we wrote about how Arizona’s promise to keep the self-driving car industry free of regulations attracted dozens of companies, including Lyft, Uber and Waymo. That lack of oversight is among the factors under scrutiny after an autonomous car operated by Uber killed a woman in Tempe, Ariz. It is believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology on a public road. • Supporters say the cars will ultimately be safer than regular vehicles because they take easily distracted humans out of the equation. But the relatively new technology is only starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face. • The authorities are trying to determine whether a package that exploded early today at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio was linked to four recent bombings in Austin. The latest explosion, in Schertz, Tex., lightly injured one employee, law enforcement officials said. The package was addressed to an Austin destination, according to local news reports. • A “serial bomber” is being sought in Austin after a string of explosions that have killed two people and wounded four. • For weeks, the international news media has shown images of wounded children and throngs of refugees fleeing the Syrian military’s offensive in a rebel-held suburb of Damascus. This week, the government hit back with videos showing President Bashar al-Assad visiting the area to congratulate his forces and to greet cheering residents. • Our correspondent reports: “Mr. Assad delivered an alternative view of the war, one in which he is assured and in charge, casually cruising past bombed-out buildings, often driving with just two fingers, an elbow propped casually out the window. It is a world in which his opponents are all terrorists and his troops all heroes.” • The chaotic five-month effort to keep the Weinstein Company afloat has ended. The Hollywood studio filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, and said it released anyone “who suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein” from nondisclosure agreements. • Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, is facing requests from several countries for exemptions from steel and aluminum tariffs. • After we published an article on tipping and the power imbalance it creates between customers and servers, hundreds of readers wrote in with their own experiences — on both sides of the equation. • U.S. stocks were down on Monday.

2018,"Opinion | Facebook’s Apology, and Next Steps","Letters To the Editor: Re “Facebook’s Chief Admits Mistakes in Guarding Data” (front page, March 22): Bravo to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, for apologizing for his mistake. “But that’s the least we can expect,” one might argue. Yes, it is, but it’s still a rare occurrence in business and elsewhere. “They’re still just words,” goes another objection. “He needs to back up his apology with a strategy for correcting his company’s mistakes.” Yes, he does. Nevertheless, it behooves us all to acknowledge Mr. Zuckerberg’s willingness to take responsibility for Facebook’s grave errors and to make sure they don’t happen again. The more we recognize a leader’s courage in being accountable, the more likely it is that accountability will be valued and cultivated. BRUCE WEINSTEIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Facebook claims “it’s free and always will be.” Recent events once again prove that if you don’t have to pay for a product, you are the product. Perhaps people might be willing to pay a small monthly fee for a more secure social network service that protects their data from companies like Cambridge Analytica. KAREN SMITH, BROOKLYN To the Editor: Various Times articles over the past several days rightly focus on the misuse of private Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign. However, a key point is not being mentioned: The formulas developed by Cambridge Analytica to explain and predict people’s personality traits and behaviors are most likely hogwash. For over 40 years I have worked for academic and public and private sector organizations as a specialist in personality assessment for the purpose of explaining and predicting behaviors. In all of my endeavors I have never achieved anything close to the level of explanatory and predictive robustness claimed by Cambridge Analytica, despite using an arsenal of data collected, with permission, from all job applicants. Therefore, in my opinion, Cambridge Analytica most likely “sold a bill of goods” to the Trump campaign, using mountains of correlation data. My advice to President Trump is to request a refund.

To the Editor: We are now starting to learn about Cambridge Analytica and efforts by wealthy authoritarians around the world to combine thievery and technology to subvert democratic elections. These efforts allow the will of voters to be thwarted. Our country needs to look at its own unique vulnerability in presidential elections. In other countries, where the winner is the one with the most votes, cheaters have a much tougher time because they must target the entire country. Not so in the United States with our Electoral College. Here the bad actors must merely focus on a few swing states and shift a small number of votes. To protect future presidential elections from this kind of fraud, we need to get rid of the Electoral College. As a side effect, my vote in California for president will actually count for something. MIKE FANNING, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: As part of his sincere apology for failing to block improper use of Facebook data to attempt to influence elections, Mark Zuckerberg should make hefty donations to help states safeguard voting systems.

Since I quit Facebook, I’ve had no trouble getting two new jobs, getting three new apartments, buying a car, getting engaged, meeting new people, or spending time with friends and family.

2018,Facebook’s Role in Data Misuse Sets Off Storms on Two Continents,"WASHINGTON — Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data, as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump’s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network’s alerting users. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data “to target political advertising and manipulate voters.” The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques. But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states. Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.” The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side. Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault. “This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.” The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew. The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used. Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.” Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted. “The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted. The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data. “Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.” Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited. “Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said. Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said. This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers. There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations. On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter. Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie. By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica. “I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.” His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data. Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting. In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it. Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data. “It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said. In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article. Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak. “This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee. An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a Democratic member of the committee, not the ranking Democratic member. (The ranking Democrat is Senator Dianne Feinstein.)",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Facebook’s Surveillance Machine,"Zeynep Tufekci In 2014, Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that would later provide services for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, reached out with a request on Amazon’s “Mechanical Turk” platform, an online marketplace where people around the world contract with others to perform various tasks. Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife. About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app “scraped” information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends’ profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica. A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn’t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a “data breach.” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false.” He contended that Facebook users “knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” He also said that “everyone involved gave their consent.” Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn’t a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook’s business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook’s users. Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook’s true customers, whom it works hard to please. Facebook doesn’t just record every click and “like” on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases “external” data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge “offline” data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases. Facebook even creates “shadow profiles” of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States. Despite Facebook’s claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her “consent” — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off. This wasn’t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person’s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook “likes” — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day? Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable. What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time. The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company’s operations in the 2016 presidential election. If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn’t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn’t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone’s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance. Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook. The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests? A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.",The New York Times
2018,Facebook’s Zuckerberg Said to Agree to Testify Before Congress Over Data Privacy,"WASHINGTON — For 10 days, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has been under increasing pressure from lawmakers and regulators to answer questions about the improper harvesting of data of 50 million Facebook users by a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. Now Mr. Zuckerberg plans to go to Washington to explain himself. The chief executive has agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network’s handling of customer data, according to people familiar with the decision. Specifically, he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public. Mr. Zuckerberg may make other appearances; he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees. His appearing on Capitol Hill could create a spectacle that is replayed online and on television for years to come, especially amid a backlash against the power of tech behemoths. Late last year, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter showed up at congressional hearings to discuss Russian meddling online in the 2016 presidential election, putting faces to the tech platforms during criticism of their misuse. Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare, and their appearances have each set off a media circus. In 2013, Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, addressed senators about his company’s tax practices. In 2011, Google’s chairman at the time, Eric Schmidt, spoke about the company’s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And in 1998, Bill Gates, who was Microsoft’s chief executive, defended his company against lawmakers’ assertions that he was building a monopoly — an argument he eventually lost in court. “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,” said Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. CNN earlier reported that Mr. Zuckerberg had decided to testify in front of Congress. He has been under pressure to appear before Congress since reports on March 17 that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained and used the data of 50 million Facebook users. The revelations immediately sparked a furor on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators in Britain and the United States calling for Mr. Zuckerberg to discuss what happened. Those calls haven’t subsided, even though the chief executive issued a public statement last week outlining the steps that Facebook was taking to prevent improper harvesting of the data of its 2.2. billion users. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users. Politicians including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, have also pressed for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear on Capitol Hill. Mr. Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers. He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy. Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week, according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter. Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, and Molly Cutler, its associate general counsel, have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce, Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, they said. Mr. Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress, and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name, two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said. After the public outcry over Facebook’s data and privacy settings, Mr. Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear, they said. In recent days, he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify. In an interview with CNN last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he would be “happy to” testify in front of Congress and that “it’s the right thing to do.” He added of Cambridge Analytica, “This was a major breach of trust, and I’m really sorry that this happened.” Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy. The companies didn’t respond to requests for comment. Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr. Zuckerberg’s absence from hearings. Last year, Facebook sent its general counsel, Colin Stretch, to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media’s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election. Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives, including Mr. Zuckerberg, and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions. In a recent interview, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said Mr. Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared, because Facebook has been too vague about its practices. He said the attorneys for Facebook, Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had “dodged questions.” “They didn’t say a damn thing, which was what they were paid to do,” Mr. Kennedy said. “I’d encourage Mr. Zuckerberg to do the common-sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this.”",The New York Times
2018,"Faced With Drought, the Pharaohs Tried (and Failed) to Adapt","Ancient Egyptian leaders increased their empire’s grain production and crossbred cattle for resilience in an early effort to ward off climate disaster, a study shows. Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. More than 3,000 years ago the queen of the Hittites, who lived in what is now Turkey, sent a clay tablet to Ramses II, the Egyptian pharaoh, with an S O S: “I have no grain in my lands.” Previously, the two kingdoms had been at war. Now a severe drought was carving a path of destruction through the ancient Levant, killing crops, cattle and people. But the Egyptians, unlike the Hittites, had anticipated a crisis and planned ahead for a food shortage, researchers at Tel Aviv University say. And in an attempt to stabilize their borders, the pharoahs appear to have mounted a relief effort, sending grain to their former enemies. In a study published in this year’s edition of the journal Egypt and the Levant, the researchers pieced together ancient evidence — including flint and bone records from the fallen city of Megiddo, fossilized pollen data from the Sea of Galilee and ancient cattle DNA — to shed light on how Bronze Age Egyptians used careful planning and policies to adapt to a drought that lasted from around 1250 B.C. to 1100 B.C., while their ancient counterparts appeared to be less well prepared. Even with preparation, however, the Egyptian empire ultimately collapsed. But the study shows how recognizing and preparing for climate disaster can make societies more resilient. “All this put together, you see a picture of a crisis and the reaction of an empire in order to try to stabilize the situation,” said Israel Finkelstein, a professor of archaeology at Tel Aviv University and the lead author of the paper. “For a while they managed, and then it was too late.” For about a decade, archaeologists have known that widespread drought in the Mediterranean was a culprit in the fall of civilizations there in the Late Bronze Age. But it is only in this latest study that evidence of the pharaohs’ prescience has emerged: In anticipation of a crisis in their empire’s southeastern arid zones, ancient leaders ordered increased grain production in its greener parts, and crossbred local cattle with zebu, or humped cattle, to create a more heat-resistant plow animal, the researchers found. At the ancient ruins of Megiddo in northern Israel, Dr. Finkelstein and his colleagues also discovered sickle blades used for harvesting grain, and an unusually high frequency of cattle bones. The age of those bones indicates that the animals were used for plowing crops, rather than eaten, explained one of the paper’s authors, Lidar Sapir-Hen, an archaeozoologist from the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History at Tel Aviv University. These agricultural feats managed to extend the life of the Egyptian empire about half a century longer than it might otherwise have lasted, according to the archaeologists. The lesson for our own civilization — which is likely to face increasingly severe droughts as humans change the climate far faster than nature has ever done — is to plan ahead, Dr. Finkelstein said. “This collapse of the Late Bronze Age is not just a matter of ancient history that has no relevance to us,” said Eric H. Cline, a professor of classics and anthropology at George Washington University, who worked at the Megiddo site for two decades but was not involved in this latest study. Just as drought was among the “stressors” leading to famine and war during the Bronze Age, Dr. Cline said, today’s droughts could amplify existing problems. “It’s a perfect storm: You’ve got not just drought and famine but there’s also earthquakes, there’s also invaders, and that’s what causes collapse,” he said, referring to a confluence of events which some think led to the end of the Bronze Age, which included powerful earthquakes in the region, and the invasion of the Levant by a group known as the Sea Peoples. The ancient world, like our own, was interdependent and suffered a “domino” fall, Dr. Cline added. Gavin A. Schmidt, the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA, said that in some ways, modern civilization had not advanced much in its coping mechanisms for climate crises. “If the sea is rising, you either get out of the way, or you get flooded; if there’s a drought, you either plant more drought-resistant crops, or you die,” he said. But, he added, modern humans possess much better predictive power and are therefore “the first generation who is able to take mitigation seriously.” Yet many countries are still behind on goals set as part of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. “This is the tragedy,” said John F. Haldon, a historian at Princeton University who studies how ancient civilizations coped with climatic upheaval. “Everyone’s aware of the problem but there’s a massive stasis in the system.” If a civilization’s leadership “has feet of clay and isn’t willing to take the challenge on in an innovative way,” Dr. Haldon said, “then often the challenge will overcome them.” Present-day humanity may have the resources and tools to deal with climate change, Dr. Haldon said, but action is often stifled by those who have a vested interest in denying the reality of human-caused climate change. “We seem to have the idea that people in ancient times or people in the past generally weren’t quite as clever as we are, but Homo sapiens is Homo sapiens,” he said. “If it’s something that we are creating — and we see what happened the last time — I think we’d be foolish not to take steps to stop it,” Dr. Cline said. “The problem is when we have deniers,” he added. “Then we’re no better off than the Hittites.” Follow @NYTClimate on Twitter",The New York Times
2018,"Facing Potential Challenge From Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo Swipes at Familiar Foe: The Mayor","A day after news broke that the actress Cynthia Nixon was in talks with two Democratic strategists about entering the 2018 governor’s race in New York, the two-term incumbent, Andrew M. Cuomo, wasted little time in denigrating her as a second-tier celebrity who had been egged on by his longtime Democratic rival, Mayor Bill de Blasio. His accusation set off a familiar war of words between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio that took on added weight in light of Mr. Cuomo’s possible primary contest. In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday about a looming snowstorm, Mr. Cuomo laughed aloud at his answer to a question about whether the mayor, a longtime friend of Ms. Nixon, is behind her possible candidacy. “I think it was probably either the mayor of New York or Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Cuomo said with a chuckle. “I am going to leave it to you, great investigative reporters to follow the facts and ferret out the truth.” Mr. Cuomo also mocked Ms. Nixon’s celebrity status. She is best known for her role in the hit “Sex and the City” franchise, though she has also won Tony, Emmy and Grammy Awards for her work. “Normally name recognition is relevant when it has some connection to the endeavor,” Cuomo said in the call. “But if it’s just about name recognition, then I’m hoping that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Billy Joel don’t get into the race because if it’s just about name recognition, that would really be a problem.” A publicist for Ms. Nixon did not respond to a request for comment. Ms. Nixon has flirted with challenging Mr. Cuomo since last summer but her talks with the Democratic strategists Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, both veterans of de Blasio’s campaigns, represent one of the strongest signs she will actually run. An education activist in New York for years, Ms. Nixon has also been studying up on other policy areas, including transportation, according to people familiar with her activities. The struggles of New York’s subways are seen as one of Mr. Cuomo’s chief political vulnerabilities, including by Mr. Cuomo’s allies. Ms. Nixon is a longtime friend of Mr. de Blasio, campaigning aggressively for him back in 2013. Her wife currently works in the de Blasio administration on education, as well. “She’s a strong independent woman who makes her own decisions,” Mr. de Blasio said in a news conference, responding to the governor’s suggestion he was behind her campaign. He went on to call Ms. Nixon “extraordinary,” adding, “Whatever she does, it’s her own choice.” Mr. de Blasio declined to say if he had spoken to Ms. Nixon — who has been spotted around City Hall in the past and was on the stage for his swearing-in this January — about challenging Mr. Cuomo, saying he was “not going to go into any private conversations with a friend, obviously.” But the mayor did not leave the issue there. He declined to say if he views Mr. Cuomo as a progressive. “I obviously have real political differences with the governor,” he said, adding that “there is a reckoning occurring” in Democratic Party primaries across the country. Not long after, Mr. Cuomo called into the local cable network NY1 and continued the fight. He bashed Mr. de Blasio on everything from his handling of public housing to the jails on Rikers Island. Mr. Cuomo said he and the mayor “just view progressive politics differently,” saying he was more focused on outcomes. “I don’t think progressive politics is a function of rhetoric and words,” Mr. Cuomo said. “I think it’s a function of results.” He ticked off a list of measures passed on his watch including gay marriage, a minimum-wage increase and gun control. “My progressive accomplishments are, I think, irrefutable,” Mr. Cuomo said. Zephyr Teachout, who ran against Mr. Cuomo from the left in 2014, finishing with 34 percent of the vote, has spoken with Ms. Nixon, along with the other potential challengers to Mr. Cuomo this year. She said that the governor was trying to distract voters. “Every part of his response is an effort to avoid the real issues New Yorkers want to talk about,” she said. As for the name-recognition comment, she invoked Mr. Cuomo’s father: the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. “Let’s just be clear: Andrew Cuomo wouldn’t have had a political career if it wasn’t for his dad,” Ms. Teachout said. Jefrey Pollock, a pollster for Mr. Cuomo, said that Ms. Nixon, if she runs, would represent even less of a threat to Mr. Cuomo than Ms. Teachout did in 2014. “Zephyr Teachout four years ago was running with the wind of a strong issue in fracking and a progressive following,” Mr. Pollock said. “Nixon has none of that today.” The Democratic primary for governor is scheduled for September.",The New York Times
2018,"Facing a Democratic Wave, Republicans Refuse to Throw Trump Overboard","On Washington WASHINGTON — If Republicans and President Trump are going down to defeat in November’s midterms, they are evidently going down together. Faced with a mortifying special election loss in what had been a Trump-loving Pennsylvania House district, Republicans on Capitol Hill did not point fingers in the president’s direction. Instead, they blamed their candidate, Rick Saccone, for running a lackluster effort while crediting the president with putting Mr. Saccone within reach of victory by firing up Trump supporters at a rally last weekend. “The president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday as he and his fellow Republicans sought to put the best possible gloss on the latest and most definitive portent yet that their party — not to mention his own speakership — is in severe peril in a very challenging midterm election climate. Statements like those and other recent developments highlight just how reluctant Republicans are to put any daylight between themselves and Mr. Trump despite obvious political danger ahead. See full results and maps of the Pennsylvania special election. History has shown that a president’s popularity is a key factor in determining the extent of a governing party’s losses in midterm elections. Presidents almost always lose congressional seats in midterm contests, but those polling below 50 percent get hit particularly hard. With Mr. Trump’s approval rating now hovering around 40 percent, House Republicans face potential losses deep enough to cost them control of the House, handing Democrats formidable power to challenge the president in the final two years of his term. But congressional Republicans are also well aware that, among the conservative Republican base, Mr. Trump is more popular than they are. That reality is reflected by the fact that congressional Republicans and the White House have aligned themselves more closely on such high-profile issues as gun control and the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Congressional Republicans have also continued to shy away from talk of the president’s personal conduct and management of the White House. And despite a wide split between Republicans on Capitol Hill and Mr. Trump on his proposed new steel and aluminum tariffs, party leaders express little enthusiasm for directly taking on Mr. Trump even though they worry the new tariffs could roil the economy and undermine what they see as their best argument for re-election: tax cuts. “I think it’s highly unlikely we’d be dealing with that in a legislative way,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday, dismissing calls by some Republicans to block the tariffs via congressional action. A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control. Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee abruptly ended its investigation into Russian collusion this week, concluding that they could find no basis to believe the president or his allies did anything wrong. They also broke with an intelligence community consensus that the Russians meant to help Mr. Trump. Their finding came despite the fact that a special counsel continues a wide-ranging investigation that could produce different results. But it cheered Mr. Trump and the White House and reflected a view by many House Republicans that their own inquiry was unfairly undermining the president — and by extension themselves — and had gone on long enough. The decision drew a strong rebuke from Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “Sadly, far too many of our friends on the other side of the aisle have been more concerned with protecting the president politically than defending our democracy,” said Mr. Schumer, who also noted the White House has refused to impose new sanctions on Russia that were ordered by Congress but has drawn no Republican criticism for its inaction. “From the top on down through the rank and file,” Mr. Schumer said, “the Republican Party that used to roar like a lion against Russia now squeaks like a mouse.” On gun control, the president only days ago seemed poised to offer a drastic departure from Republican orthodoxy on gun issues by pushing for more comprehensive background checks, raising the age limit to buy weapons and encouraging members of his party to be bold about breaking with the National Rifle Association. But instead of using presidential clout to push his party in a new direction and put lawmakers on the spot, the White House backed off and embraced more ideas more compatible with the N.R.A. while establishing a commission to explore other alternatives. On Wednesday, as students around the country demonstrated for new gun control laws, the Republican-led House passed a measure that focused more on physical improvements to bolster school safety, and the White House said it was most pleased with the progress. Despite intense public and news media scrutiny on Mr. Trump’s involvement with a pornographic film actress and payments to her by his personal attorney, top congressional Republicans have essentially ignored the subject, with Mr. Ryan saying recently that he had not “put a second of thought” into the topic. The administration’s continuing personnel turmoil has also elicited little public concern from congressional Republicans who continue to call for quick consideration and confirmation of nominees to fill increasing numbers of vacancies. While Republicans publicly deflected suggestions that the Pennsylvania race was a sign of a rejection of the president and an indictment of their own performance, party strategists acknowledged privately that the political environment represented real danger. They argue, however, that Republicans could still win by mounting strong campaigns and being prepared. For Congressional Republicans and the White House, that appears to mean sticking together, win or lose.",The New York Times
2018,Fairground Attractions at Baselworld,"Baselworld, the world’s largest watch and jewelry fair, opens Thursday and has a new shape this year. It expects around 600 exhibitors, fewer than half the 1,500 that the show reported in 2014, and two days have been lopped off its former eight-day schedule. There’s an argument these falling statistics reflect the industry’s diminished confidence in the market, but there’s evidence, too, that brands are finding other ways to spend their money — in short, doing their own thing. For now, though, Baselworld remains the industry’s showpiece, and the moment in the year for some of the world’s largest watch brands to introduce new collections. Here’s a taste of what’s to come this week. Some of the most interesting debuts of 2018 come in the women’s watch market. As predicted by analysts, brands are turning to jewelry watches to piggyback on the jewelry market, which has not experienced the declining exports seen in the watch industry over the last few years. PATEK PHILIPPE LADIES’ CHRONOGRAPH REF. 7150/250 $83,918 Patek Philippe was one of the first Swiss marques to turn its attention to the women’s market. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, it introduced some Ladies First models, featuring complications such as a perpetual calendar and a chronograph. The latter was a cushion-shaped piece discontinued two years ago, now replaced by this 18-karat rose-gold round-cased model. The watch is a surprisingly large 38 millimeters across, has a new dial design (which includes a pulsometer scale, one of watchmaking’s most charmingly pointless devices) and is powered by one of Patek’s in-house hand-wound chronograph calibers. The bezel is set with 72 diamonds. HARRY WINSTON EMERALD $13,800 In a bid to steal some of its rivals’ thunder at the Salon de la Haute Horlogerie, Harry Winston officially unveiled the latest addition to its Emerald collection in January. The company, owned by the watchmaking giant Swatch Group, is certainly tactical. What’s as interesting is that it’s chosen to spearhead this year’s novelties not just with a women’s watch, but with a quartz model. The brand has invested considerable sums in fine watchmaking advances but, rather like Cartier, it is centering its activities on more accessible — relatively speaking — pieces, early signs this year indicate. In Winston’s case, this means quartz jewelry watches. This one is sprinkled with 108 diamonds, totaling 0.6 carats, three brilliant-cut pink sapphires and one heroic emerald-cut pink sapphire; it comes on a wraparound pink satin strap. GRAFF FLORAL Price on request Graff’s diamond riches continue to fund its watchmaking ambitions, seen in real time this year with the new Graff Floral collection. Available in four colors and inspired by the flora of the Delaire Graff Estate in South Africa, the watches feature rotating flowers at 1, 8 and 10 o’clock. Each of these is in perpetual motion, creating a hypnotic dial dance that’s becoming typical of the London-based jeweler’s watch division, which marks 10 years in watchmaking this year. As well as having 37-millimeter cases pavéd with diamonds, the watches are also a showcase for métiers d’art, in particular enamel- and micro-painting. Inside each is an automatic movement with a 46-hour power reserve. OMEGA DE VILLE TRÉSOR $8,600 Omega has doubled up on its heritage with the new women’s De Ville Trésor collection. The watch is the latest expression of a model first seen in 1949, and the first to be fronted by Kaia Gerber, the model daughter of Cindy Crawford, herself an Omega ambassador since the mid-1990s. Omega has chosen quartz over mechanical for the new pieces, filling both the 36-millimeter Sedna Gold and 39-millimeter stainless steel versions with battery-powered calibers. Both case sizes have a slither of pavéd diamonds up the sides, and a diamond inserted into a crown that’s also decorated with a flower created of red liquid ceramic. The watch is fashion-forward: Along with a raft of material, strap and dial variations, it has a mirrored case back, a “useful accessory at hand,” the brand announcement said. At some point, the watch industry will get out of the sales rut it fell into a few years ago — that at least appears to be the conviction behind some of the bolder, more experimental designs being unveiled this year. In fairness, the green shoots of recovery are visible, with Swiss exports up almost 13 percent year-over-year in January. BULGARI OCTO FINISSIMO TOURBILLON AUTOMATIC $118,000 At 3.95-millimeters thick, the Octo Finissimo Tourbillon Automatic becomes not only the world’s thinnest automatic tourbillon but also the world’s thinnest automatic watch, dethroning Piaget’s Altiplano 910P, which held the title for all of three months. It’s no hyperbole to single out the watch as a remarkable achievement, nor to suggest that only a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that Bulgari would be claiming this crown. But this sandblasted titanium watch, limited to 50 pieces, has now given the Italian company its fourth world record for thinness in just five years. CHANEL BOY.FRIEND SKELETON, CALIBRE 3 Price on application While some of its fashion competitors have put their fine watchmaking operations on ice, Chanel continues to press ahead. The Boy.friend Skeleton, in what Chanel calls Beige Gold, is powered by the Parisian maison’s third in-house caliber, Calibre 3, a hand-wound, skeletonized, blackened movement with a 55-hour power reserve. ZENITH DEFY ZERO G $100,800 The return of Zenith’s Defy last year came with the introduction of a one-hundredth of a second mechanical chronograph. This year the brand is bringing a full collection to Basel, continuing the high-concept message with this gravity-resisting model, which contains what it calls a “downsized and fine-tuned Gravity Control gyroscopic module.” This three-dimensional micro-mechanical marvel sits between two sapphire crystals at 6 o’clock, contains 139 parts and is housed in a 44-millimeter brushed titanium case that’s a hefty 14.85-millimeters thick. HUBLOT BIG BANG UNICO RED MAGIC $26,200 Never a wallflower, Hublot is convinced that it has created the world’s first “vibrantly colored ceramic.” The company also said this new ceramic, which it calls Red Magic, is denser and harder than conventional ceramics, was developed in Hublot’s own research and development department, and took four years to get right. Only 500 of the 45-millimeter watches will be made, each powered by Hublot’s Unico HUB1242 column-wheel flyback chronograph caliber. NOMOS GLASHÜTTE AUTOBAHN $4,800 The independent German watch house Nomos Glashütte has largely refrained from marketing its products by what the industry calls “worlds,” a segmentation strategy adopted by most of its competitors. But this year it’s moving into motoring with the Autobahn, a piece designed in collaboration with the Berlin furniture designer Werner Aisslinger. The 41-millimeter steel watch is also the first to carry the DUW 6101 automatic caliber, the 11th produced in-house by the brand. BELL & ROSS BRV2-94 RACING BIRD $4,400 In recent years, Bell & Ross has introduced watches alongside high-concept supercars and motorcycles from its own design team. This year it’s taking that approach to a new level by pairing a watch with a plane, a single-seater pylon racer created by the brand’s co-founder and creative director, Bruno Belamich. The BR-Bird plane has the wings; the BRV1 and BRV2 Racing Bird watches have the hour and minute hands. This is the BRV2 chronograph version, which shares its graphic look with the plane, and will be made in a run of 999 pieces. RADO TRADITION 1965 XL AUTO $2,300 Rado says the original inspiration behind the design of its angular Tradition 1965 was the Manhattan skyline. The rethink of that five-decades-old model might have a retro look but its case is made of titanium coated through the PVD, or physical vapor deposition, process. It’s a modern material that’s about 40 percent lighter than stainless steel. Rado will be making 1,965 of the model. CORUM HERITAGE ARTISANS COIN WATCH $21,000 Unique watches are headline fodder, and don’t brands know it. Corum is the latest to prove the theory with a one-off watch with a dial made of a United States dollar coin, with a skull and octopod motif overlay; a strap made of bluejeans; and water resistance to 10 meters, a shallow, hitherto unfashionable figure. In business, and particularly in a stressed market, smell what sells, they say. In watchmaking terms, that means sticking with classic designs but putting a novel spin on them. This year, many of the big dial names are leading with safe bets: reanimating tried and tested models, rather than experimenting with new lines or technologies. BREGUET CLASSIQUE TOURBILLON EXTRA-PLAT AUTOMATIQUE 5367 Price to be announced Details make the difference at the high end of Swiss watchmaking. Breguet’s latest marks the first time the brand has introduced a grand feu enamel dial into its Grandes Complications collection. Under the beige dial is a slim-line automatic with an 80-hour power reserve and a tourbillon with a platinum carriage. CHOPARD L.U.C QUATTRO $24,400 Chopard’s tendency to create watches that look as if they’ve just fallen from the wrists of well-heeled central European businessmen shows no signs of abating. The latest is a version of its L.U.C Quattro, a collection mainstay — this time, a simple rose-gold-cased piece with an in-house caliber that boasts a whopping nine-day power reserve. Its blued hands, numerals and hour markers sit on a silver-toned and vertical satin-brushed dial, complemented by a strap of blue calfskin leather with a woven effect. JAQUET DROZ GRANDE SECONDE TRIBUTE $21,400 The name of Jaquet Droz (the “z” is silent) might not be front-of-mind — its 280-year history is somewhat mixed. Recently, it’s become a collector favorite, led by its signature Grande Seconde, with its dominant running seconds counter and figure-of-eight dial layout. The watch was revived in 2002 but this is the first time it has been presented in yellow gold. Given the brand’s popularity in China, it is not, however, the first time we’ve seen a Jaquet Droz model limited to 88 pieces. GRAND SEIKO HI-BEAT 36000 V.F.A. $53,000 There are two key dates in the history of Grand Seiko. The first is 1960, when the Seiko sub-brand made its debut; the second, 1998, when it introduced the 9S mechanical caliber, which has become the platform for every Grand Seiko caliber. Twenty years later, Grand Seiko comes to the table with a suite of three limited-edition anniversary styles. Prime among those is the V.F.A. model, which stands for Very Fine Adjusted, and is accurate to plus-three to minus-one seconds per day. Only 20 of the platinum-cased piece will be made. TAG HEUER CARRERA CALIBRE 16 CHRONOGRAPH $4,350 Tag Heuer openly admits that its best-selling model is the Carrera. The motor sport-themed watch turns 55 this year, giving the brand a moment to produce a series of anniversary pieces. One of those is this 41-millimeter steel model with a polished black ceramic bezel, a reverse panda dial (a current Tag Heuer favorite) and racy red detailing. CARL F. BUCHERER MANERO TOURBILLON DOUBLE PERIPHERAL $72,300 The most universally friendly design by the Lucerne-based house of Carl F. Bucherer is its Manero. This version carries the new CFB T3000, the brand’s third in-house caliber. Like the duo that came before, the new unit has a peripheral rotor, a feature the company trades on because it brings the benefits of an automatic without the hazards of a rotor that obscures 50 percent of the movement. The watch’s tourbillon is peripherally mounted, what the brand says is a world first, so the tourbillon appears to be floating. ORIS DIVERS SIXTY-FIVE DATE $2,000 The Divers Sixty-Five has given Oris’s design credentials a shot in the arm since its introduction three years ago. Its 1960s design cues, solid quality and honest pricing have struck a chord with critics. This year, the independent Swiss company has added some voguish bronze to the outer edge of the watch’s diving bezel, marrying that with rose-gold-plated hands and hour markers, and an earthy leather strap. MEISTERSINGER LUNASCOPE $3,850 Making a watch with just the one hand has given MeisterSinger its U.S.P., the philosophy being that some people are more interested in the bigger picture than being anywhere on time. The German company’s latest is its first astronomical watch. It features an uncommonly large, detailed moon that will need adjusting (assuming it’s kept wound) only once every 128 years. The raft of brands missing at Baselworld this year include some that have fallen on hard times but also a number that are going their own way: either defecting to rival fairs or running their own shows. HERMÈS SLIM D’HERMÈS GMT $14,700 Once a Baselworld stalwart, Hermès crossed the divide in January to the Salon de la Haute Horlogerie. The short nine-month gap between last year’s Basel and this year’s S.I.H.H. no doubt curtailed its offering there, hence the arrival now of an addition to its Slim d’Hermès line of watches. The slimline case and Philippe Apeloig’s bespoke numerals are joined by a gray dial, a smoked sapphire crystal and a version of Hermès’s H1950 caliber, powered up to show a second time zone with day/night indicators for both local and home time. Cased in palladium, it’ll run to just 90 pieces. BREMONT ALT1-C $6,495 Bremont’s damp, windy corner at Baselworld’s Palace proved too small a home for the British brand, which bailed on Basel last year and instead took over a townhouse in London for a few days. It repeated the pop-up last month, and then took the format to New York a couple of weeks ago. At these, it announced an update to the ALT1-C, the watch that kicked off the Bremont story in 2007. It’s now dressier, with baton hour markers instead of Arabic numerals, and includes a blue version inspired by the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force this year.",The New York Times
2018,Falling Gold,"Picture Prompts A recent Times article reported: Yakutsk, a city 5,000 miles from Moscow where temperatures can plummet to minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit, is not the sort of place where people normally spend winter nights searching the bushes by torch light. But it is not every day that 3.4 tons of gold falls out of the sky. What guesses can you make to explain why gold fell from the sky in Yakutsk? What is the most interesting, beautiful or unusual thing you have ever seen in the sky — or falling from it? What do you think caused the phenomenon you witnessed?

2018,"Falling Gold, Phone Manners, Bad Citizens and Great Leaders: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week","Current Events Conversation Even though many schools are on spring break, we still received hundreds of comments from all over the United States this week, and we enjoyed reading remarks on the nine Learning Network writing prompts featured in this post — especially those from Chicago; Pittsburgh; Rochester, Wash.; Dallas; Providence, R.I.; and Saco, Me. As always, thank you for offering your insightful opinions and sharing your personal experiences. It’s especially heartening to see that some of you are taking time to read and then reply to other students’ comments after posting your own. Keep it up! Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ Our Student Opinion prompt “Have You Ever Felt Pressured to Betray Your Beliefs?” asked students about Benjamin Glaze, 19, who, while auditioning for “American Idol,” was asked whether he’d ever been kissed. When he said “no” and explained why, Mr. Glaze was kissed by Katy Perry, one of the show’s judges. Many students strongly disapproved of Ms. Perry’s actions, saying Mr. Glaze’s religious beliefs were disrespected. In the eyes of many who commented, the kiss was harassment. Faith Beaulieu from Saco, Me., said simply: In this case is wasn’t a pressured betray of beliefs, it was a forced one. Francesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., thinks Ms. Perry should be held accountable: I have lost any respect I might have had for Katy Perry, and I’m not sure that I even had any. The whole debacle was embarrassing and inappropriate. The 19 year old Benjamin Glaze, who received the unwanted kiss, expressed that he was “uncomfortable” with the kiss as it was his first, and had expected his first kiss to be a bit more meaningful. He also said he felt that he “did not feel sexually harassed,” but did Katy Perry know that he wouldn’t when she planted that physical manifestation of romantic intimacy on an individual almost 15 years younger than her? No, she didn’t, and the truth is that she probably didn’t care to consider what he might feel when she made the decision to kiss him. Her behavior can be reflected in the sleazy Hollywood sexual offenders that we all viciously exposed and vilified (and rightfully so, I am in no way defending them), yet somehow we give Katy Perry a pass? She should be held accountable for sexual misdemeanors regardless of her gender, as should all women. She used her position of power as a reputable judge and artist to force an unsolicited romantic/sexual act on a teenager she’d never even met before, which is harassment and should be treated as such. Jaliyah from winnetonka said Mr. Glaze was not treated with respect: Honestly I think his gender has to do something with all this happening too. For men if something like this happened no one would care or they would just care less, because they think he is a man he should like being kissed by women especially if she’s a star, and if he doesn’t like it he’s a cry baby or he should just defend himself. If this was a girl, and a man who kissed her without consent the world would freak out, but for guys they’re told to just be a man about it so what they believe or their thoughts are ignored or joked about even by other guys. This guy’s morals were disrespected because he is expected to just suck it up and be a man about it. What she did was creepy and although she meant no harm I think his morals should have been respected and that you shouldn’t be kissing random people anyway. Hadley Todd from Wilmington, N.C., has not ever been pressured to betray personal beliefs: I honestly cannot remember a time where I have been pressured to betray my beliefs, but I have definitely pressured another to do so unintentionally. I usually stick to the opinions I have and others often feel intimidated by this and end up agreeing with what I have to say, probably because so many people don’t have a mind of their own if I’m being honest. They’re so afraid of being rejected by others for disagreeing with them or putting up a fight that they just cave in as if that will make them likable. I would rather somebody actually have the brain to disagree with me because it would show that they are an individual that can speak for themselves. Denislav Kasaivanov from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the media overreacted to the incident: One measure of how strongly you believe in your opinions is how likely you are to stray away from them when pressured. Personally, I haven’t betrayed my beliefs because I would like to say that my opinions are formed through what I, myself, have experienced in my so-far 16 year life. I value sticking to your word greatly, causing me to severely dislike those whom change their opinions in order to fit into the ‘norm’ or to not be ‘singled-out’ for their viewpoints. At the end of the day, I think that you shouldn’t care about what other people think because you should live life the way you want to live it, and not take everything too seriously. Aside from that, I stand somewhat in the middle of the Benjamin Glaze situation. Should she have went up there and given a kiss without asking? No. Should it have been blown up to this proportion in media outlets and have all this hate directed at Katy Perry? No. At the end of the day, Mr. Glaze did say he wanted to ‘Save his kiss for his first relationship’, and Perry should have asked and acknowledged that, as a matter of respect. But what this boils down is into another public-relations catastrophe between TV media and the public; not aiding in the already construed skepticism of mainstream media. Ben C. from North Carolina does not impose his will on others: I have been pressured to betray my beliefs a number of times, but I do not impose my will upon others. What Katy Perry did was unacceptable, and it probably messed with his performance in paragraph 11, as he delivered a lackluster performance because he was disappointed that his first kiss was not with someone he loved. Mary Wells from Wilmington, N.C., found herself shocked: When hearing the news how Katy Perry abused Mr. Glaze’s beliefs, I was shocked. It was not right for her to have tricked him and forced him to kiss her when he wanted to wait for the right person. The article states how he did not want to kiss her because he was raised from a conservative family and wanted his first kiss to be special. He wanted his first kiss to be with someone special and Katy Perry disrespected his religious beliefs. I admit I have been pressured to change my beliefs because of other people. I remember in elementary school my friends were different than the ones in preschool and expected more from me. I was expected to practice cheerleading and spend recess talking and sitting rather than running around, swinging from the monkey bars, which was an activity I enjoyed. One year later I realized that I did not want to be someone’s personal cheerleader and I went back to playing on the playground. I do not let others tell me what to do because I have learned that pressure makes me feel guilty and overall not happy. perla elias from caruthers said feeling pressure to do something is not welcome: I have been pressured to do something and it is not a good feeling. I have been pressured when I was playing softball in middle school and I was the last one up to bat and they all counted on me. Everyone was quiet and they were all staring at me and just were telling me that I could do it but I just felt really pressured because if I didn’t hit the ball we were going to lose the game. At the end of the game we had won and I had hit the ball and I brought my teammates home but I had so much pressure on me. Aubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington, N.C., said women and men must be held to the same standards: In order for movements like #MeToo to be successful, it cannot be subjective. I am a huge proponent of feminism and I strive to spread awareness and equality anyway I can, but the definition of feminism, in my opinion, is that men and women are equal. It is contradictory to hold this belief and think that it is okay for Katy Perry to kiss a teenage boy, just because she is a woman. She should be held to the same standard that we would hold a 33-year old man to if he were to kiss an unwilling teenage girl. Her actions put an innocent teenager in a highly uncomfortable position, one that is common for young women: A higher powered person preying on defenseless subordinates. Of course Benjamin didn’t say he wouldn’t kiss Perry - it is hard enough to tell somebody that holds your future in their hands “no” when you aren’t on national television. It is fair to say that Benjamin was pressured into forsaking his beliefs, but so are all of the feminist, or even semi feminists out there saying things like Benjamin was lucky, or that what Katy did was cute. This issue spreads its wings outside of this one (horrible) incident, all the way to the feminist movement as a whole. If we ever want true equality these are the times that we have to stick to our guns and make sure what we say and believe about situations outside the norm of the feminist issue column remain consistent with what we would think if the roles were reversed. Kayla Renee from Pennsylvania has never felt pressure to betray her beliefs: I have never felt pressured to betray my religion. When I hear this question I start to think about Muslims feeling pressured to eat pork or Christians feeling pressured to have sex before marriage. To answer this question I would say I, as a Christian, have never felt pressured to betray my beliefs or religion. Amy Blanchard in Saco, Me., said the kiss was not consensual: I don’t believe what Katy Perry did was right, specifically because if the genders were swapped, there would be massive backlash. I understand why she did it in the moment, she probably thought he had never kissed someone because he never had the opportunity or something, and Katy “gave him that opportunity.” But as Benjamin stated, if Katy had asked him, he would’ve said no. Therefore, there was not consent, and we make a big deal about consent in society when men act without it, and women should be pressured to get consent too. Liz from Maine thinks the kiss was an assault: This is sexual assault. It might not be as extreme as other stories, but it still stands. Guys are held to a different standard than girls when it comes to sex, think about how much outrage would surface if the roles were switched. Imagine if a 30 y/o guy kissed a 19 y/o girl, it would be madness in both real life and on social media! But, when a guy is assaulted, people are proud of him and “jealous”. They are told to “man up” and that “you are so lucky!” The whole thing just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. _________ Our Student Opinion prompt “Are We Being Bad Citizens If We Don’t Keep Up With the News? was very popular, with views on both sides straightforwardly expressed. Athena Brenner from Wilmington, N.C, applauds Erik Hagerman’s retreat to solitude: If I’m being fairly honest, I applaud Mr. Hagerman. Is it responsible? No, not exactly. From the choice he’s made, he isn’t exactly a “good citizen” by American standards; seeing as though he isn’t speaking out and making sure he is carrying out his civic duties. But can we really blame him? This man survived through the constant news reports on Black children and adults wrongfully being killed by our own policemen on a monthly basis. He observed his TV screen helplessly as a bar in Florida was shot down by one hostile man simply because of the fact that it was meant for people who are attracted to the same sex. He lived in an America where he watched a grown man yell childishly about his personal 1st world problems, gloat to other men like him about how he takes pride in assaulting women, then proceed to win the American presidency. The list goes on and on. Erik Hagerman did something for himself; he ran away from the issue and stopped paying attention. This does make him selfish and irresponsible, but who acted wrongfully first? He saw the President being irresponsible with his power, the police being irresponsible with their guns, and the citizens being irresponsible with their rights. He saw America being reckless and impulsive, and he chose to no longer be a part of it. Unlike everyone else’s actions, this selfish act made him happier. So though I don’t necessarily agree with him, I condone his abrasive choices. Cheers to a life in peaceful solitude! Sophia McNamara from Chicago thinks it is a childish move: I believe that Mr. Hagerman’s decision to ignore all news was highly irresponsible and silly. As citizens of the United States, we are supposed to know what is going on in the world, and help our government deal with problems. Our government was created so we the citizens could interact and change what we wanted, but if we don’t know what is going on the government could take over. Also, if we don’t pay attention to news, we can miss major events that could threaten our life. For example, there could be a mass shooting or a war that we have to fight in, but we would have no idea that these events were happening. Jordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., likes the attempt at a balanced life: In this day in age, everybody needs to have time to themselves, without a constant overflow of information, just like Mr. Hagerman. Having time to think, even if it is just for a few minutes, is crucial to being well balanced. I applaud him for taking on such a large undertaking, and trying to look within himself to find satisfaction rather than at the tumultuous string of current events. Tara Samtmann from Wilmington, N.C., said a basic understanding of the news is important: We live in a society of information overload and news is one area that seems to get the most attention. As a high school student, it makes a lot of sense to understand what is happening around the U.S., to help prompt discussion in the classroom or at home. Adults should have a basic understanding of what is happening around the world, since it could impact decisions you make in your life. So, I feel all citizens should make an effort to keep up with the news. But, do we need to be inundated by TV, tweets, online articles, constantly, 24 hours per day? Do we need to be experts on every topic and hold a strong opinion on each one? No way! As Mr. Hagerman said, “I had been paying attention to the news for decades, and I never did anything with it.” There is much truth in that statement, because we rarely make major personal decisions based on what you read or hear on the news. Plus, do we really need to keep hearing about the same issue over and over for days on end? But we should be aware of the issue. His Blockade of all news is a bit extreme, but I applaud him for his efforts. Instead of blockading the news, each person must develop their own way of getting the news they need. Our individual challenge is to determine the best source for news which meets our personal situation and develop the discipline to not partake in the 24 hour a day news frenzy. Develop your own method for getting the news, so that you can be a good citizen and be aware of the issues and take appropriate actions if needed. Josh P from Washington said he can relate, but doesn’t support ignoring the news: Being in high school, I can relate to the feeling of wanted to stay away from the drama that I don’t understand or approve of. But I think that totally ignoring everything that’s going on around you, and in your government, is a bit too much. It is important to know what’s going on around, so you can prepare yourself for what might come. On top of it all, just because he doesn’t support the leader of the country, doesn’t mean that he should avoid everything that’s going on within his country, making him a bad citizen because he isn’t supporting or having any concern for his country. Kyler C from Rochester, Wash., thinks following the news is responsible: In my opinion Mr. Hagerman is taking the 2016 election way too far. I understand being upset about your candidate not winning, and I would also understand if he had followed through with his original plan of only protesting a few days; however a year is unbelievable. The media is used for more than just government news, granted the media does seem to focus on that subject quite often, even then he could just turn the channel if he is watching the news on TV, whenever a political subject appears. I feel that it is kind of our responsibility as citizens of the United States to be up to date on America’s news along with global news, global warming for example, if people are up to date on the current issues, they could do their part to help solve these issues. Therefore, Mr. Hagerman should stop his ”silent protest” and become more aware of what’s going on in the world. John Doe from Louisiana thinks the answer is yes: The simple answer is yes, if you don’t keep up with the news then you are a bad citizen. When you isolate yourself from your own country you shouldn’t be considered a citizen. Everyone should know what is going on in the nation because it’s their nation. When you don’t know what’s happening then it’s the same as not caring for you country. _________ We asked students how they related to the graph in our Picture Prompt “A Scary Time.” Here’s what they had to say. Katharine from Rhode Island interpreted it this way: I think this image is trying to explain that when one is in a stressful situation, it’s best to have positive interactions that reinforce a sense of belonging and being cared for. In this case, it’s getting a hug. When someone is in a bad place, they usually don’t want to hear “I told you so,” hence the smaller need for facts and lectures. I agree with this message to an extent. Mainly because hugs or affirmation in general, can only do so much and to function many people need to understand the consequences of their actions or need to be motivated to do so. Aminah I. from Providence, R.I., discussed the importance of physical touch: In my opinion, I think the image is relaying the importance of physical contact during times of intense stress. Cortisol, a hormone responsible for stress, is lowered considerably through hugs. Although most people try to put on a tough act of not needing physical contact with others, almost everyone feels better with hugs. 11th grade is arguably the hardest year for a high school student, with all the AP Exams and SATs/ACTs. I know that whenever I cuddle my cat, I become relieved and de-stressed almost immediately. Patrick Iammatteo from Wilmington, N.C., finds comfort in a different way: This image portrays the idea that people going through hard times need love and support, rather than facts and lecture. While this is true to some extent, love and hugs don’t fix your problems. I relate to this, but in sort of a different way. When I go through tough times in my life, I cope by listening to music. The words spoken and the music played are my version of hugs and support. To listen to someone writing about similar problems lets you know you aren’t alone, and that there is hope in the future. This version of sympathy resonates with me stronger than any other. I also agree with the fact that LECTURE only makes things worse. This is why the graph shows an upside down bar. Nobody wants to be yelled at constantly when they are in a distressed state. It can only hurt. Sydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., shared how she handles scary times: The image portrays how in scary times, either with a test coming up or dealing with a loss, the most important and beneficial thing we need is comfort. Being lectured or yelled at when anxiety is high never helps to ease the worry. As the article mentions, with the downfall of the current stock market, some people are finding themselves scared. The best way to overcome this is having someone who will listen to you, provide you with comfort, listen to your worries and provide kind comments to ease your stress. Once you are able to release some stress and be more rational, then, you can start reworking and thinking about how to handle the situation. I agree with the message the image portrays. Whenever I’m going through a tough time, I don’t want to be lectured about how I’m doing something wrong or how to fix the problem. The first thing I want is someone to just listen to what I have to say and affirm me, that everything will be okay. After I’m calmed down, then I can start figuring out how to approach the situation and a rational way to deal with it, but I need that emotional support at the beginning. You can’t go wrong with a hug. _________ Our Student Opinion question “What Activities Make You Feel Most Alive?” brought some surprising answers. Beck RT from Massachusetts enjoys singing: Singing has been something that I personally have been very passionate about since I can remember. Performing is something that I have become passionate about in recent years and these two activities combine into something that gives me a rush of adrenaline. The feel of performing in front of people with a few of my friends makes the experience blissful and makes me feel powerful. Singing and performing makes me feel more alive and gives me a joy that nothing else can give me, which is why I continue to do so as often as I can. Emily Ball from Wilmington, N.C., said nature is the thing: I can definitely see why Mr. Doba felt the way he did about the kayaking. There is something about being one with nature that takes you back to your roots. With feeling wild and free, there is almost always a sense of ferality as well, because most of the times when you are your most wild and free, you are doing things in nature. When reading about his excursion, I immediately was overcome with great admiration for the man, at 71, who crossed the Atlantic Ocean via kayak. I then read about all of the harsh conditions that he endured, and all of the things that happened to him physically, such as almost losing all of his nails and having his clothes become so salty that he couldn’t wear them anymore. The one thing that makes me feel alive is swimming. I swim 6 days a week, for a team, but when I swim I feel alive. I believe I feel this way because when I am swimming, I have time to myself, time to think, this makes me feel alive. I hope that when I am Mr. Doba’s age, I do things to push myself and stay active. I would like to hike, ski and hopefully still swim when I am 71. Nick Hargrove from Wilmington, N.C., says risk provides a nice thrill: I feel like the two main ways to make you feel most alive are to either do something competitively where you give it your all or put your life on the line. Some people may say well how is kayaking fun or thrilling? Well Doba is both putting his life on the line as well as competitively trying to break records such as greatest number of days paddles by a Polish man in a single year. Doba would even go as far as to kayak in the Baltic Sea while the Communist Party declared it illegal. When Doba’s phone stopped working he pressed the help button on his spot device. When they came to rescue him instead of hopping aboard and going to shore to get his phone fixed he refused to leave his kayak and requested for his phone to be fixed. If you are still unable to understand the thrill, just think of a roller coaster. While riding a roller coaster you know that if something goes wrong you may die. It is this risk that gives the thrill. Annie Herring from Dallas hopes to row and hike into her old age: Ask any of my friends: the first, well, nine months after every summer vacation are spent telling them about the beauty of dirt under my fingernails, how much fun sleeping in a tent is, and the thrill of reaching a summit, among hundreds of other details. I understand Mr. Doba’s feeling while he kayaks; there is a certain je ne sais quoi about pushing your body to reach a certain goal. While reading this article, I was overwhelmed by reverence for this man who dedicated his life to seemingly impossible goals. For example, when Doba proposed kayaking across the North Atlantic, his trip was deemed impossible, and even deadly. However, Doba ventured to prove them wrong for the sake of his objective to cross the Atlantic in the southern, middle, and northern routes. This intense goal setting is something that I see reflected in my teammates on my crew team; they push themselves to their limits on the daily in order to reach their goals. Sometimes barely able to exit their boats, they beam after winning a race or PRing on a piece. Another kind of ecstasy that I observe is when I am in the backcountry with my friends. I hope that when I am Mr. Doba’s age I can continue to row and hike; hopefully still with friends by my side! Jordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., said devotion to a passion is where life comes from: When I am standing in the front of the classroom, seeing the numerous eyes of my peers and dead silence, I feel most alive. To have the attention of every person in the room, for a topic that I care about immensely, that for me is like crossing the Atlantic. For that brief moment that I was pitching my ideas for our school newspaper in my journalism class, I felt that I had accomplished something. Of course, all students were required to share their story ideas, but I felt like I had been Mr. Doba during the last few miles of his journey. To do something that you are most passionate about is where life comes from. Anybody can live, but it takes devotion to your passions in order to be fully alive. And Francesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., is inspired by Aleksander Doba to overcome her personal daily struggles: Mr. Doba uses a Polish word, katorga, to describe the suffering he endures while completing excruciating kayaking trips repurposed as determination and an “existential thrill.” I can see that, having been at sea for 110 days without face-to-face social interaction and having to weather through nature’s toughest obstacles, he would look “ecstatic and feral … intrinsically wild and free.” His kayaking trip must have reminded him, shockingly, of his undeniable state of being. As someone who faces a constant and daily war with mental health, sometimes I struggle to truly feel alive. The burden of mental illness can make it difficult to find passion, or motivation, or even to muster energy to get out of bed. There are, undoubtedly, things that make me happy. Simple things make me feel alive: playing music, running, or just laughing with my friends. Despite these things, I feel like I have an existential crisis every day. There is one thing I’m confident about: I want to live, and experience life to its fullest. It’s my dream to do something arduous and taxing yet gratifyingly so, something that can remind me of my presence in the universe; something exhilarating like backpack across a continent, or bike cross-country, or climb a mountain. Those are all difficult to obtain as a full-time student and teenager, but they’re 100% on my bucket list. Mr. Doba is certainly an incredible man, and he has inspired me to do something crazy yet existentially fulfilling. _________ With dozens of different responses to “What Makes Someone a Great Leader?,” commenters proved there are myriad ways to move and inspire others — whether you are a man or a woman. Katie M. from Pittsburgh defined a leader this way: There are many characteristics of being a great leader. When I think of a great leader, they should be honest. Being honest and gaining people’s trust is important. You have to set good examples for others to follow, so, having their trust does come in handy. A great leader should be someone who is respectful, intelligent, strong, and confident. People turn to leaders for help and someone they can talk to without a problem. Leaders should be respectful towards their peers and loyal those they are leading. A great leader means you are confident in your beliefs and you take risks to help your ‘followers’. A leader who is intelligent in what they are leading others to is important. You want your peers to be able to have confidence in you and not doubt you. Leaders should have an open, positive mind. A leader should stand out and be known. People should be able to look up to their leaders. Everyone has the ability to be a great leader. It’s just a matter of if you’re willing to put in the effort. Abbey Skinner from Danvers, Mass., said that a great leader is a great person: In my opinion, a great leader is someone who puts others needs before their own needs. A great leader needs to have power with their words; they need to be able to motivate someone else to do something that they never thought they could do. Great leaders may not be the best at what they do, but they can create other people who are. Great leaders are hard to find because so many people would rather see themselves succeed than the people who they are “leading”. Men and women can absolutely be equally effective leaders. Being a great leader is not about your appearance; it is about how you act and what your morals are. Anybody can be a great leader, but many times men are more outspoken and arrogant than women and many people perceive outspoken and confident individuals as leaders since they are usually the first to speak. This, however, has nothing to do with being a true leader. A great leader does not have to say the most; they just have to say enough to motivate people. Morgan B. from Massachusetts discovered from her own experience that there are many ways to lead: The stereotypical leader is someone who possess the qualities of being decisive, independent, courageous, often times loud, and has a bold presence. While I agree that some leaders possess these qualities, I think that every leader has their own unique character. A leader is something who stands out, who takes the extra step to be noticed — even if it not intentional. Going to an overnight camp for the past nine summers, I learned to become a more independent and courageous person. These skills that I gained I thought made me more mature, but many people told me that they made me a better leader. This was surprising because I did not consider myself to be a leader. I thought leaders are supposed to be loud — I’m quiet, leaders are supposed to be decisive — I am very indecisive, and I do not have a bold presence — I just blend in with everyone else. However, I then realized that is what made me a leader: my differences. Sometimes we do not recognize leaders because they are not what and who we expect them to be. Leaders are often overlooked by others because of how they look, from their gender, and from their personality. Opinions are often form by someone’s first impression, and although first impressions are important we have to get to know others before labeling or characterizing others. Everyone has the ability to be a leader whether they realize it or not. Sometimes we just need a little help finding our voice to channel the inner leader hiding inside. Many students also commented on the reasons women are less likely to be perceived as leadership material, and why recognizing these stereotypes is important. Clea Matt from Danvers, Mass., wrote about a lack of representation: Sadly, I am not surprised people imagine leaders as men. In our society we still see many more men in leadership positions, a great example of this is the fact that America has had only male presidents. This looming fact and the lack of representation of females in powerful positions creates a stigma. In all of the drawings of leaders people believed that strong leaders were good listeners, decisive, caring, and well educated. Women and men can both be equally strong in any of these and all qualities. In my own experience as a leader I have not been taken less seriously because I am a woman but it was harder for me to get to where I am now. Many people believe that women and especially teenage girls are afraid to speak in large groups and handle the attention that comes with needing to be a leader. Girls need to put in more work to get those opportunities that boys have simply handed to them. Being a leader means being a good listener but also following you gut and representing a group in the best way you know how. This has nothing to do with your gender, being a good leader is all about having strong leadership skills. Both women and men can have these skills but women have to work harder to get the opportunities to show off these skills. Anna C. from Wilmington, N.C., pointed to the media’s portrayal of women: Great leaders are intelligent, competent, empathetic, organized, and assertive. He or she cares about what their employees think, respects their coworkers, and takes the time to listen to their worries or suggestions. Given these qualities, I see no reason why women and men can’t be equally effective leaders, for these characteristics are taught and learned, not born into. We should focus on teaching young girls to be less passive and obedient and more confident and assertive, as well as showing more children female leaders along with their male counterparts. Besides this, I think the medias we’re constantly exposed to should put more thought into the content they’re creating, as many stereotypes and sexist beliefs can be enforced by what they broadcast. A common trend I’ve noticed on TV shows is that female leaders are often depicted as bossy and rude, and the main characters gripe about her and make derogatory remarks. This scene (and other sketches/jokes like it) are often brief and mindless, but as other shows repeat the same material, the stereotype is reinforced in the minds of the viewers. This isn’t the sole reason women aren’t seen as leader-like/good leaders, but it does contribute to the spread and resilience of such stereotypes. The good news is, we have been improving. More women are taking an interest to political and economic leadership positions, and more people are noticing this. One day, it will never be doubted that women can be leaders. Ryan Brooks from Danvers, Mass., gave an example from her own life: A great leader possesses clear visions, honesty, humility, courage, integrity, trust, et cetera. Although it is significantly more difficult for women to assume leadership positions, women still have the capability of becoming just as good of a leader as a man. Leadership is defined by the leader’s positive attributes, not their gender. A woman can be just as hardworking, courageous, honest, and trustworthy as men. In my personal experience, my leadership has not been doubted in academic classes, only physical classes such as physical education. Because I have earned the reputation of being intelligent based on my grades, I have never had my intelligence or leadership in group projects questioned. However, in gym class, my leadership is questioned constantly. I am one out of only three females in my class. Because I am a female, the males in my class assume I am not as athletic or not as talented at sports as them. Therefore, the other girls and I are always picked last for games. Although I do not object or try to take on a role of leadership, I always do my best to prove the boys wrong. And Essence Bradford from WHS concisely explained why addressing this issue matters: In my opinion, a leader can be a female or a male. A leader’s greatness isn’t defined by their gender, it’s defined by their qualities and actions. Gender shouldn’t really matter as long as they meet all of the standards. To me, a great leader is someone you can look up to, someone that always does the right thing, is intelligent, a good listener, honest, has good communication skills, sets good examples, and is just a good person overall. Typically, when people think of leaders I feel like they think of males no matter the situation. It’s important to recognize these stereotypes because some women may have great leadership skills, and be overlooked because they aren’t male. I feel like that’s wrong because females can do just as much as males can in my opinion. _________ Students weighed in with their opinions about technology etiquette on our Picture Prompt “Phone Manners.” Jordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., ranted about teenagers’ inappropriate use of technology in social situations: I hate it when people go on their phones in social situations, whether it is during dinner, at a party or during a conversation. It is rude, and extremely inconsiderate. Whenever I am talking to a friend, (teenagers are notorious for being tech addicted), and they are looking down at their phone, I feel like they do not care about what I have to say. Obviously, whatever they are doing on their device is more important than what I have to say. If you have ever looked at those photos of teenagers sitting next to each other, all looking down at their screens and laugh, just take a deeper look about what is happening. A new generation is growing up, being technologically adept and socially inept, generally speaking. Smart phones should not take the place of real interactions, which have become ever more valuable in a tech addicted world. Shelby Johnson from Massachusetts is equally annoyed by such behavior: I think that there are many cases in which people overuse their phones to a rude extent. One major red flag for inappropriate phone usage is when out at a restaurant. If you go out to eat, you should be enjoying the experience. It is disrespectful to the staff of the restaurant to be focusing upon a cell phone instead of the food and service that they are providing. Also, if you are talking on a phone, you may be disrupting other people within a close vicinity. Even more appalling is the treatment of who you are spending time with. There is not much worse than seeing people out to eat and having one person on their phone completely ignoring the other. All too often, people focus on their phone instead of the people that they are spending time with. While cell phones and new technology are great assets in many situations, when they take away from personal interactions they become a problem. People should continue to appreciate the people around them instead of being sucked into their cell phones and distracted in order to use phones appropriately. And Kaley Nesselroade from Wilmington, N.C., sometimes gets so bothered that she wishes phones were never invented: For me, I tend to completely check out of the conversation when someone is focusing more attention on their phone than to what’s happening in the real world. When people are more interested in who they’re snap chatting at the moment or who just added a new Instagram post than hanging out with their friends, it shows a new level of rudeness. A lot of times when I’m hanging out with a group of people, or even just one person, I look around and everyone is sitting in silence with their nose in their phones. It bugs me to the core and sometimes I wish I lived in the time when phones weren’t as accessible. I’m sure people would get to know one another better and form real life connections. As the article states, “Etiquette, manners, body language, the way we respond, interact and even look is changing,” and sadly it’s true. The days when people actually held eye contact and were 100% present in a conversation are slowly slipping away as society starts to put our phones first and the people right in front of us second. Sarah Welford from Danvers, Mass., was one of the few commenters who thought phones could help, instead of hinder, social interactions: We all are familiar with the phone-obsessed-people-who-are-ruining-human-interaction trope. Especially as a teenager, it seems that every time I go out with friends people are always glued to their phones, checking Instagram, and sending snaps. However, phone use in conversation is not inherently evil. Phones are devices that are meant to enhance communication, and are mostly used to connect with others rather than ignore them. Obviously, you should not check your texts while listening to your friend recount the death of their beloved dog or any other such topic requiring emotional support. But often in conversation, we check our phones to look up relevant information, contact others in order to include them, or to share pictures of our latest exploits with the people we are with. While there are times when it is disrespectful to use phones when another human being is talking to you, that is not always the case, and most of us are good at using our discretion. Zac Gill from Wilmington, N.C., learned proper phone manners from his family: Ever since I was first given a phone, it has been a clearly stated rule that there would be no phone use at anytime during dinner. Whether we’re at a fine restaurant or just dining in at home, the only contact my mom allows is real face-to-face interaction. This strict cellphone ruling has been ingrained in me at this point, keeping me off my phone in most interactions. Being able to have a disconnect from my phone has allowed me to see so many other people completely negate any social interaction just because they care too much about their own cellphones. Researchers at the University of Michigan have suggested that “empathy levels have plummeted while narcissism is skyrocketing.” This makes total sense. Our generation is being taught that it is okay to ignore and belittle whomever they are with. These teens and young adults needs to learn that whatever it is that’s on their phones is minuscule in comparison to the interactions they could be having in the real-life world. Josh Failla from Wilmington, N.C., suggested that learning to put down our phones and embrace the awkwardness is the key to building better relationships: I’ll admit, from time to time I find myself looking at my phone instead of interacting with the group I’m in. I am not proud of it, and I may sound like a hypocrite commenting on this topic, but I feel like we should all put our phones down when we are with other people. I feel like most of us look at our phones when we are hanging out with people because we sometimes feel awkward talking others. Instead of being social and talking with others, we resort to looking at our phones to make ourselves look busy. We even will look at our phones with nothing on the screen to avoid the awkward social interaction. In the article, a statistic states that 75% of Americans believe that smartphones don’t impact the group setting, but I feel like it has the biggest impact. Some of life’s greatest moments happen when you are hanging out with others, and if all you are doing is looking at your phone, you might as well just be sitting at home by yourself. We should all put down our phones when we are hanging out with others. Maybe if you do this, you may learn something brand new about a person, and you may become better friends with that person. You can not build relationships behind a phone screen. _________ “Have You Ever Experienced Food Insecurity?” prompted some deep thinking on the part of commenters, who spoke movingly: Olivia Lain from Wrightsville Beach, N.C., thinks no children should go hungry: In my county, one in four children are food insecure. We have free and reduced lunch programs and in some schools children are given backpacks with food for break times, but I can’t imagine how they get through spring break with maybe not much more than that backpack of food. I feel like the part of the article about being “keenly aware of their own economic disadvantage” over spring break is really true, because while I live in a city near the beach, there are kids right here that have never seen the ocean. I frequently go to the beach with my family and friends, so to hear about my classmates going all the time if I’d never been would be torturous, not to mention the more extravagant vacations to the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Disney World, and elsewhere. I definitely think all colleges should keep their cafeterias open over spring break for those who would be food insecure otherwise, or even for those who aren’t able to go home like the author. I feel like public elementary, middle, and high schools should adopt this policy as well, though I realize the reality of transporting these kids to cafeterias might not be feasible for those outside of walking distance to their schools. This could be remedied if school buses were still to operate and bring children to their school cafeterias over spring break. There’s really no reason that children should go hungry in America, so I hope that this changes with access to food being more accessible in the near future. Kevin from Vancouver, British Columbia, thinks schools need to do more: I felt that universities should be doing more to provide the basic necessities to their students. However, just like most boarding schools, they leave their students to fend for themselves. The school should at least provide a little bit of support as the tuition is not cheap. In addition, in the article, it states that one of the students rely on microwaveable food for his meals which I doubt is healthy so the schools are impacting the student’s health. The schools should also allow students to stay on campus during spring break for free instead of charging them a fee. This gives students who aren’t traveling some extra cash to spend which takes economic pressure off them. The students are given the choice to use the kitchen to cook their food which is cheaper than buying food. Overall I feel that schools are doing a pretty bad job at keeping students fed. Tyler Rouse Wilmington N.C., agrees with the new changes to accommodate all students: Some of my friends get lunch from the cafeteria. They always complain about how terrible the food is. They have things like pizza, french fries, and hamburgers every week. Whenever I can, I try to give them something from my lunch. I agree with the paragraph which states not having enough food can affect your school performance. I believe this to be true. If you are constantly hungry and always thinking about food during tests, that would be terrible. I couldn’t imagine trying to concentrate in school while being hungry. The data from the article surprised me that 1 in 4 college campuses open their cafeterias during breaks. Honestly, I thought there wouldn’t be that many. As mentioned in the article, most students travel off campus for spring break and other events. Now that I think about it colleges really should have their cafeterias operating for anyone who is staying on campus. Janelly from Providence, R.I., has empathy for those who have experienced food insecurity: I personally have not experienced food insecurity, nor do I know of anyone who openly spoke about their own experience. The students mentioned in the article should never have to feel different from the other students who can afford to leave campus on spring break. Not knowing where your next meal would be coming from can definitely make you feel “keenly aware” of your own economic disadvantage, which these closed cafeterias do. If I saw my peers leaving campus to go on vacation or to go home and I knew I couldn’t afford it, I would automatically feel bad about myself. With schools like Columbia and Harvard that changed their spring break-cafeteria policy, progress was made. Of course, more steps in the right direction should be made other than a change of policy and free lunch for all grade levels. More schools should continue to take into consideration the student’s advantages and disadvantages and cooperate to benefit all students, not just a handful. _________ The Picture Prompt “Cast of Characters” asked students what story is told in the image above. Parker Bolles from Wilmington N.C., thought of the Seven Deadly Sins: While looking at this image I can’t help but think of the seven deadly sins with lust, gluttony, and pride placed to obviously in the foreground. More subtly in the foreground however, I noticed the crowd, a strange cast of characters themselves. I believed this was to represent how a person views characters in a story, how one may raise themselves up thinking, “at least I’m not like them” while only interpreting the grossest of exaggerations. To be terrible, but not that terrible, ironically engaging in pride. As I read the article, I understood it was intended to portray the evil and their tragedies, “Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit: Thou art essentially mad without seeming so.” Also, and more lightheartedly, it intended to portray a message of living life for what it is worth, “But to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed.” This was interesting to me since the author, Bloom, takes heavy inspiration from Shakespeare, whose tragedies don’t show much mercy. I agree with the writer of the article, Winterson, that Bloom’s writing is a sort of breath of fresh air to language. Neil Phillips from Wilmington, N.C., cringed at the image: I would describe this picture as messy, silly, comic, outrageous, but full of life (see where I’m getting). I think it relates to how Harold Bloom presents Falstaff. Bloom rebirths Shakespeare’s concept of to live for versus to die for. Even so in a way that brings liveliness to the reader or follower, which can relate to the crowd that looks alive and active as the drama takes place in front of them in the picture. I admit my first impressions on this image was a cringe. My head started to hurt as I tried to capture and focus on the drama that takes place on the frame. But I also believe that the illustrator did to me what bloom does to his students. Giving me first an uncomfortable feeling and then bringing me to a glimpse of interpretation thanks to some help from the article. Tucker G. Oakley from Wilmington, N.C., created a short story: Ah! What a blasted vision of society and the music is just like a fine brandy! If I still had a say, I would give the accordionist a finer dress and at least a broad audience, I mean can they even see how awestruck the queen is. Of course, the king has other needs to tend with a withering stare. Just seeing him caress the sweatband of that plump drunkard sends a nasty growl through my pale gut. They laugh and drink as love dies, of how a noble-lady could ever fall in love with a black peasant. Blast those two to all seven layers of the inferno, for love is love! That is where I must mention this sad sap, still mourning over the skull of his mistress. I know for she is here next to me, but her voice is as silent as days since her passage. Wait, blimey! A pixie, why I have always thought of them to be no more than old wives tales. Oh, well the way he continues to eye the drunkard’s wine, I assume he intends to spike it for his sins. Bah! What do I know, I’m simply a ghost behind the scenes, just choosing to lament somewhere more reflective. _________ Our Picture Prompt ""Falling Gold” asked students to guess what caused bars of gold alloy to fall onto a runway in Russia, or to remember the most beautiful or unusual thing they ever saw falling from the sky. Max Bergman from Wilmington, N.C., said, to him, sunshine is as valuable as gold: Gold falling from the sky? Cmon that’s ridiculous! Well in Yakutsk, where temperatures can plummet to minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit, it happened. Yes, precious gold fell from the sky, and not just a couple ounces of it. More than 3.4 tons of gold was recovered from the runway, however this NYT article did state that, “They turned out to be doré, a semi-pure alloy composed of gold and silver, not pure gold, but close enough”. Besides that’s still a lot of gold and gold is worth a lot. In fact one ton of pure gold alone is worth a little over 64 million dollars. That’s enough money to buy 60 of the highest class sports cars on the market. Although I wish gold would fall from the sky in my town, I know it’s very unlikely. I live in a beach town, so I am blessed to see beautiful sunshine falling from the sky most everyday. I know sunshine isn’t as valuable as gold, but in my mind it is. Neil Phillips from Wilmington, N.C., has questions: The most interesting thing I have ever seen come from the sky may just be anything frozen. It’s pretty hard to recall because considering where I live, having the terrain frozen like it is in Yakutsk, or seeing any precipitation other than rain or sometimes ice is very rare. This article brought a positive imagery, I could see a short time span of gold blocks raining out of the sky in what was an epic moment for the ages, only to later turn out to be an accident that fell out of a plane, which left me loaded with questions. Where was a plane taking that much doré? Why so much? Who put that much a burden on a plane? I guess the moral of this story is how the irony can make someone’s day (like it made mine, with the imagination), but also ruin it like it did those who sought an opportunity to grab riches that fell from the sky. Brianna Browning from Wilmington, N.C., recalled a childhood memory: Had to be a plane. Maybe the pilot sneezed and hit a button. I wish I was there to cash in on some free gold. The strangest thing I’ve seen falling from the sky would have to be a waterspout. I was out in the boat roughly 30 miles offshore of OIB. The next thing I know is my dad hollerin’ ayyyy there’s a waterspout bout a mile out. So I turn and saw this water tornado that I thought was gonna suck us right up! Now that I look back on this I laugh at how I thought spinning water would eat me. savannah brittain from Wilmington guessed correctly: It is hard to believe that 3.4 tons of gold fell straight from the sky in Yakutsk. I think it was some sort of aircraft that just happened to drop loads of it on the ground. Now I can’t really tell where this picture was taken place but in the background that definitely doesn’t look like a normal road. It is a lot wider so it could possibly be an airport or something and a plane dropped the gold as they were flying in the sky. Come to find out, after reading the article it was an airport! I can’t imagine the people’s faces when the shiny material had fallen to the ground. It’s unbelievable! The most alluring thing that I have EVER seen in the sky is..... rainbows!!! When you look at a rainbow it just makes you realize how beautiful our world is and it just makes you want to smile due to the fascinating colorful arch. The garish colors gives you this feeling inside that relaxes your heart and makes you say.....”wow”. I don’t think that there is anything else (that I have seen) that is as beautiful or pleasing than a rainbow. _________",The New York Times
2018,Fallout for United Airlines Continues After Death of Kokito the French Bulldog,"Fallout from the death of a French bulldog named Kokito continued for United Airlines on Thursday, as the airline explained how the dog had come to die in an overhead compartment and two United States senators introduced a bill to stop such a thing from ever happening again. United’s admission followed an uproar over the Monday death of Kokito, who was placed in the overhead bin shortly before a flight left Houston for New York. Maggie Schmerin, a spokeswoman for United, said that the airline had spoken to the family, the flight crew and passengers who had been seated nearby. The flight attendant who placed the carrier in the overhead bin said she had not heard the owner tell her that the dog was in the carrier, Ms. Schmerin said. A witness and the owner said the dog had been barking before takeoff. “As we stated, we take full responsibility and are deeply sorry for this tragic accident,” Ms. Schmerin said. “We remain in contact with the family to express our condolences and offer support.” Senators John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, and Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, introduced a bill on Thursday to prohibit airlines from storing animals in overhead compartments. The bill is called Welfare of Our Furry Friends Act, or WOOFF. Meanwhile, the Harris County District Attorney’s Office, in Texas, told a local news outlet that its animal cruelty task force would conduct an investigation into the death. If there was one cause that Americans could unite behind, it was justice for Kokito. Putting animals in the overhead compartment was already against United’s policies. But the airline said that in April it would start issuing brightly colored bag tags to customers traveling with in-cabin pets, in order to prevent animal deaths in the future. In a Spanish-language interview with Telemundo on Tuesday, the dog’s owner, Catalina Robledo, said that she had warned airline employees that the dog would be in danger in the overhead bin, but that they insisted on putting the carrier there. “I asked them, ‘How am I going to put my puppy in the overhead?’” she said. “‘He’s going to suffocate.’” She found his body when the flight was over. “I put him on the floor and I was hitting him, asking him to wake up, but he was already completely dead,” she said, adding that the crying flight attendant had said she did not know the dog was in the bag. “He was barking, how could she not have known?” Ms. Robledo said French bulldogs, an in-demand breed for many dog owners in the last decade, often develop respiratory problems, partly because of the way their faces are shaped, and are prone to heart defects and other diseases. United Airlines has suffered a string of bad press since last year, when a passenger was dragged off an overbooked flight at a Chicago airport. More recently, its treatment of pets has come under scrutiny. Just this week, it apologized for having mistakenly sent a German shepherd, meant to reach Kansas, to Japan.",The New York Times
2018,"False Confessions, Mistaken Witnesses, Corrupt Investigators: Why 139 Innocent People Went to Jail","At least 139 convicted defendants in the United States were exonerated last year, and most owe it to the work of lawyers in prosecutors’ offices and private organizations dedicated to finding wrongful convictions. Such “professional exonerators” were responsible for more than half of the exonerations in 2017 and have been a driving force in overturning wrongful convictions in recent years, according to a new report from the National Registry of Exonerations, which tracks such cases. “It makes you really wonder what would the feelings on exoneration be, and how many would we see, if there were more of these organizations,” said Barbara O’Brien, a law professor at Michigan State University and the editor of the registry. Since 1989, when DNA was first used in an exoneration, at least 2,100 people have been cleared of their convictions, according to the registry, underscoring the fact that the system sometimes gets things wrong. The registry added new layers to that understanding with a pair of reports released on Wednesday, one on exonerations in 2017 and another on those from 1820 through 1988. Here’s a look at some of the findings. Much of the rise in exonerations in recent years is attributable to “professional exonerators” working in conviction integrity units of prosecutors’ offices and organizations like the Innocence Project. Last year, they helped overturn 80 convictions, a slight drop from the year before, but only because one prosecutor’s office was working through a backlog of drug cases. According to the registry, there are at least 33 conviction integrity units in the nation and at least 52 private organizations dedicated to uncovering and overturning wrongful convictions. On average, each defendant exonerated last year spent 10.6 years behind bars, adding up to almost 1,500 years spent waiting to be cleared. Ledura Watkins, in Michigan, waited longer than any other person who was exonerated last year. He was released from prison last summer, more than 41 years after being convicted in the murder of a schoolteacher. He was convicted based on a hair found at the scene, which bore microscopic similarities to his own, but the F.B.I. later discredited the process. Only two others listed in the registry were exonerated after a longer wait. For Walter Lomax, who was freed from a Maryland prison in 2014, it took 46 years to secure an exoneration. Paul Gatling, whose conviction in Brooklyn was overturned in 2016, had to wait 52 years. For years, Harris County, Tex., drove the national number of exonerations up as it reviewed a backlog of questionable drug possession convictions. That backlog accounted for more than 40 exonerations in 2015 and nearly 50 in 2016. But, as the review winds down, that number dropped to 10 last year. Well over half of the people exonerated last year were initially convicted because of official misconduct, such as officers threatening witnesses, analysts falsifying tests or officials withholding evidence that would have cleared the defendant. In just under half of the exonerations last year, defendants were wrongfully convicted in cases in which no crime was committed. This included more than a dozen drug possession cases, 11 child sex abuse cases and nine murder cases. In one case, Rodricus Crawford, who was on death row in Louisiana, was exonerated. The state dismissed all charges against Mr. Crawford last year after officials acknowledged that evidence suggested his infant son died with pneumonia and bacteria in his blood, implicating sepsis in the death rather than murder.",The New York Times
2018,Family Harmony of the Musical Kind,"Ties Last year, my dad almost died. Top-notch medical care is probably what saved him, but our family is convinced that what really pulled him through was family harmony — of the musical kind. In October, not long after his 89th birthday, he tripped in the kitchen, hit the door jamb and fell with such force it shattered his bones and knocked him out. Mom was there and pumped on his heart. Then she called the paramedics. They took him to the hospital in the country town in Wisconsin where we grew up, where he was evaluated and then raced to the University of Wisconsin’s state of the art hospital in Madison. Because of a neurological disease that made it hard for him to walk, he couldn’t get around much, but he still loved to sing and tell jokes. When we gathered at the family home, we sang all the old songs — “Bill Bailey,” “Buffalo Gals,” “Deep in the Heart of Texas.” My mom and sisters took the melody, and my dad, my brother and I harmonized. When we sang, even as kids, Dad always insisted on harmony. His mind was still sharp, too. Oh, he forgot the names of friends and neighbors and sometimes even the names of his grandchildren, but he rarely forgot the words to a song or the punch line to an old joke, and he rarely missed an opportunity for a wisecrack. Not long before his accident, he and I were watching a football game together, when I got up to use the bathroom. “Mention my name,” he said, “and you’ll get a good seat.” But there was no joking when I got the call from Mom, and rushed to the hospital. Doctors and nurses hovered over Dad. By evening, we were all there, all 20 of us. His emergency medical team asked us end-of-life questions: Did we want heroic measures taken? Did we want a feeding tube put in? The understanding was that once they put one in for someone his age, it rarely came out. Then one of the doctors, looking grave, assembled us outside Dad’s room, out of his earshot, and explained that she thought it wise for us to consider saying our goodbyes. Dad had fractured his spine in a number of places and had lots of broken ribs and fluid on the lungs. His recovery was unlikely. Suddenly I thought about never watching another Packers game with him and never again hearing him call me “Son.” Frankly, when I was in high school, I’d disliked it when he used the word publicly. It sounded effeminate and too full of affection. But as I grew older, I became fond of its sound. It had a certain melody, and when he called me “Son,” I felt how deeply he loved me. Dad had never known that kind of love from his own father, a lieutenant in the Navy during World War I who became a dental surgeon. My dad tells me that my grandad was a handsome Tennessean with a wonderful sense of humor, but he was also a drinker and a wanderer, and his marriage to my grandmother went poorly. When my grandmother left him, she returned with my dad to the Wisconsin farm where she was raised. Over the years, my granddad occasionally visited, but my dad’s first memory of his father came years later, when his father traveled north by train to visit. My grandma, Dad and my dad’s younger brother, who would be my Uncle Billy, were there to greet him. But when he got off, he was drunk and wobbling. Later, in the car, he got irritated with my Uncle Billy’s whining and slapped him up. My granddad hung around for a while and, over the years, my dad would see him now and then, but mostly he was gone. It was the minister from the church who had to accompany my dad and Uncle Billy to father-son school functions. My dad couldn’t have been more different from his father. He was a family man. At picnics, he organized games for all us kids. He took me fishing and hunting and rarely missed one of my football games. He didn’t drink and never swore except when telling a joke in which a certain well-placed word made all the difference. He was occasionally short-tempered — what father isn’t sometimes — but he loved us and he let us know it. When I left the hospital that first night, one of the nurses assured us that if Dad showed signs of not making it, he’d call us. I slept with my cellphone on my nightstand. The next day, I arrived early and the nurse took me aside and said that Dad seemed a little better. He added the word “remarkably” and then said he likely wouldn’t need to be intubated. “He wants to live,” he told me. Three days later, they moved Dad to the intensive care unit. He had nurses and doctors, a physical therapist and a respiratory therapist. The respiratory therapist’s job was to help him with his breathing exercises to clear his lungs of fluid. The fluid made him a pneumonia risk, which at his age was especially dangerous. When she took off his mask, which he had been wearing 24 hours a day, he looked like someone had ground his face into a wrestling mat. When the respiratory therapist was busy, I worked with him, too, making sure he did his reps. All of us kids did, but we still couldn’t get his oxygen levels up. That’s when my mom struck upon an idea: She had been whistling in a store and someone told her it was good for the lungs. She wondered if music might help Dad. It was a teaching hospital, and while the team of doctors was making its morning rounds, Mom told the lead physician that Dad loved to sing, and asked if it could help him. The doctor paused and then shrugged his shoulders: “Why not?” So for the next three weeks, we gathered in Dad’s room and sang. He sang into his oxygen mask, though his voice was muffled. Often the nurses joined in. One time, a nurse, whom my dad especially liked, sang “Red River Valley” with us before he moved on to his next patient. “Wasn’t that fun?” I said to Dad. I had to lean in close, so that I could hear him from under the mask. “Nice baritone,” he said. “I think I could teach him to harmonize.” Slowly Dad’s oxygen levels rose. The X-rays showed less and less fluid on his lungs and the mask was removed permanently after a CT scan. Now, he could really belt out the songs. When one of the nurses came in with a big belly and told my mom that she was six months pregnant, Dad chimed in, “Have you figured out what’s causing it?” Then, he and Mom launched into “Hush Little Baby” with Mom on the melody and Dad singing tenor, his voice getting stronger.",The New York Times
2018,Family Mourns National Guardsman Killed in Iraq Helicopter Crash,"Days before her grandson was deployed to Iraq for a transport mission, Gloria Smith treated him to dinner at his favorite Hibachi restaurant on Long Island. It was not Staff Sgt. Dashan Briggs’s first deployment, but each tour brought a familiar sense of worry, Ms. Smith said. That night, she warned him: “Be vigilant. Be careful. And do what you have to do.” “‘Don’t worry, Grandma,’” she recalled him saying. Sergeant Briggs, 30, of the New York Air National Guard 106th Rescue Wing, was one of seven service members killed when a United States military helicopter crashed near Qaim, Iraq, on Thursday. Four of the dead, including Sergeant Briggs and Capt. Andreas O’Keeffe, a 37-year-old pilot, were part of the New York unit based in Westhampton Beach, Long Island. Two were New York City firefighters. The cause of the crash is under investigation, though enemy fire was not suspected, according to the Department of Defense. “All four of these heroes served their nation and community,” Col. Michael Bank, the commander of the 106th Rescue Wing, said in a statement on Saturday. “Our sincerest condolences and sympathies to the families and friends that have been touched by this tragic event.” Maj. Gen. Anthony German, the Adjutant General of New York said, “This loss reminds us of the tremendous risks we take in serving our nation every day.” Sergeant Briggs joined the National Guard when he was 22, said Ms. Smith, his maternal grandmother. He grew up in Riverhead, a small town on the North Shore of Long Island, where he was raised by his paternal grandparents. He played football in high school and received a scholarship to Morrisville State College. Three years ago, his grandmother said, he bought a house in Port Jefferson Station. He is survived by his wife, Rebecca, and two children, a 1-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son. “He loved being a dad,” Ms. Smith said of her grandson. “He took care of his wife and kids and nothing else mattered.” Captain O’Keeffe, of Center Moriches, Long Island, was an HH-60G Pave Hawk pilot. He worked as a federal civilian employee. As a guardsman, he was stationed at the 101st Rescue Squadron before joining the 106th Rescue Wing in 2013. He had also served as an armament systems specialist with the 113th Wing with the District of Columbia Air National Guard, and as an RC-26 pilot with the 174th Attack Wing with the Hancock Field Air National Guard Base in Syracuse. Captain O’Keeffe had been deployed to Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa and Iraq. He also was sent to Texas after Hurricane Harvey. Efforts to reach his relatives on Sunday were unsuccessful. Also killed were Capt. Mark K. Weber, 29, of Colorado Springs, Colo.; Master Sgt. William R. Posch, 36, of Indialantic, Fla.; and Staff Sgt. Carl P. Enis, 31, of Tallahassee, Fla. “He loved his job, he loved serving our country,” Ms. Smith said of her grandson. “Anything can happen at any time. But I was happy for him because he was happy.” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ordered flags on all state government buildings flown at half-staff on Monday in honor of Sergeant Briggs, Captain O’Keeffe and the New York City firefighters, Lt. Christopher J. Raguso and Christopher Tripp Zanetis. Ahmed al-Mahilawi, the mayor of Qaim, said residents living near the crash site saw the HH-60 Pave Hawk go down shortly after takeoff. A preliminary investigation indicated that the helicopter may have had a technical malfunction before it crashed. The aircraft used is typically flown by the United States Air Force for search-and-rescue missions and medical evacuations, and is a modified version of the army’s Black Hawk helicopter. The 106th Rescue Wing was operating in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, a coalition that focuses on combating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.",The New York Times

2018,"Family of Christine Beshar, Trailblazing Lawyer, Selling Co-op","Exclusive A grandly proportioned 14-room apartment on the 11th floor of the 120 East End Avenue co-op building, opposite Carl Schurz Park and facing the East River, is being put on the market by the family that has owned it for more than four decades. The seller is the estate of Christine Beshar, one of the first female partners of a Wall Street law firm. She died in January. The asking price will be $8.95 million, said Serena Boardman of Sotheby’s International Realty, who is the listing broker, along with her colleague, Meredyth Hull Smith. Monthly maintenance is $10,485. Mrs. Beshar specialized in trust and estate law at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and was made a partner seven years after she was hired, in 1971. The following year, she and her husband, Robert P. Beshar, also a lawyer, moved into No. 11A at East End Avenue, on the northwest corner of 85th Street, with their son and three daughters. The young family’s move came at a time when the city was experiencing soaring crime and serious financial issues, and many residents were fleeing to the suburbs. “New York City was really in tough shape, but my parents saw value in this apartment, with its enormous, sun-filled rooms and magnificent views,” said Cornelia Beshar Spring, one of Mrs. Beshar’s daughters, estimating that her parents paid “less than $200,000” for the place back then. Not too much has been done to the apartment since the Beshars settled in 47 years ago, and remained until their deaths. (Mr. Beshar died in 2014.) “They were very good stewards of the architectural integrity of the apartment,” Ms. Boardman said, “which is very rare today.” For potential buyers, Ms. Smith said, the unchanged state of the apartment represents “an opportunity to have all the prized prewar details that haven’t been ruined or removed by poorly done renovations along the way.” The home’s numerous architectural flourishes include original features like 10-foot ceilings in the entertaining space, herringbone oak floors, decorative moldings and two wood-burning fireplaces that are in working condition. There are also decorative faux bois wall designs and hand-painted Gracie wallpaper. The apartment, which offers striking park and river vistas from its many floor-to-ceiling windows, is roughly 5,250 square feet, with five bedrooms and six and a half baths. The unit has a private elevator landing that opens to a stately gallery with a black-and-white checkered floor and a powder room. The gallery leads to the three main public spaces: a library with built-in bookcases and a fireplace, a formal wallpapered dining room and a 30-by-20-foot living room with built-in display cabinets and the second fireplace. Off the dining room are a breakfast room and a large eat-in windowed kitchen, with a service elevator, laundry and two staff rooms sharing a bath nearby. At the back of the apartment, off a long hallway, is a private wing that contains the five en-suite bedrooms and a family room/playroom fashioned from two maid’s rooms. The large master suite has two walk-in closets and a tiled bathroom. “It’s all so properly laid out,” Ms. Boardman said. “It’s a real family apartment.” Ms. Spring, who is a managing director of J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said she and her siblings have fond memories of their childhood home. “There were always a lot of people there,” she said, recalling the holiday parties her parents had with their German relatives in attendance and the many after-school gatherings with classmates. “We’d come home in the middle of the day and bring our friends, and sit down at the kitchen table with a gallon of ice cream and several spoons.” The East End Avenue apartment house — a block from the Chapin School, which the Beshar girls attended — was developed 87 years ago by Vincent Astor and designed by the architect Charles A. Platt. Although the building’s 17-story limestone facade is free of embellishment, except for grillwork around its oversize windows, the apartment interiors were designed to be as spacious and ornate as many of those found in Fifth Avenue contemporaries. Mr. Astor wanted to attract wealthy families to the Far East Side of Manhattan, once a threadbare area of walk-ups and factories. Mr. Astor and his wife, Brooke Astor, also lived in the building. Other early tenants included Thomas Hitchcock Jr., a well-known polo player, and Lawrence Tibbett, a star baritone at the Metropolitan Opera.",The New York Times
2018,Family of Seth Rich Sues Fox News Over Retracted Article,"The parents of Seth Rich, the young Democratic aide whose unsolved murder became grist for right-wing conspiracy theories about the 2016 presidential race, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Fox News, claiming that the network’s coverage helped fuel damaging rumors about their son. The suit, filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, accuses Fox News of “extreme and outrageous” conduct. It claims that a reporter for the network, Malia Zimmerman, and a regular Fox News guest, Ed Butowsky, intentionally fabricated a story that portrayed Mr. Rich as the person who leaked thousands of internal Democratic National Committee emails to WikiLeaks in 2016, which released them to the public in an act that proved damaging to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. That story, published on the Fox News website on May 16, 2017, implied that the murder of Mr. Rich on the streets of Washington occurred in retaliation for his having leaked the emails. No evidence to support that theory emerged during an investigation by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, and Mr. Rich’s family said they believed that Mr. Rich, then 27, was killed during an attempted robbery. Fox News retracted the article a week after it was published, saying that it did not meet network standards. Still, the theory about Mr. Rich persisted, cited by prominent conservatives like Newt Gingrich and right-wing broadcasters like Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones of InfoWars. The rumors about Mr. Rich proved useful for pundits seeking to undercut the notion that Russian forces supporting Donald J. Trump’s campaign were responsible for the leak. Sean Hannity, of Fox News, was one of the most vocal proponents of the theory, although he eventually backed off after his network’s retraction. Fox News said on Tuesday that it could not comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit was first reported by ABC News. The suit’s allegations zero in on the role of Mr. Butowsky, a wealthy Trump supporter whose involvement in the Fox News coverage of Mr. Rich is already the subject of a separate lawsuit. In August, a private detective hired by the Rich family sued Fox News for defamation and racial discrimination, claiming that the network had fabricated quotes attributed to him as part of a coordinated effort with the White House to smear Mr. Rich. (Fox News denied the charges, and Mr. Wheeler has since dropped his discrimination claim.) The detective, Rod Wheeler, who was himself a Fox News contributor, also claimed that Mr. Butowsky had coordinated with the Trump administration to plant the story. Mr. Wheeler said that Mr. Butowsky met with Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary, to discuss the investigation into Mr. Rich’s death shortly before the Fox News story was published. The White House confirmed that the Spicer meeting occurred, but denied any involvement in the story by the administration. Mr. Rich’s parents, Joel and Mary Rich, claim in the new lawsuit that Mr. Butowsky took advantage of their grief over their son’s death to ingratiate himself into their lives and manipulate them into hiring Mr. Wheeler to aid with their investigation. In a statement on Tuesday, Joel and Mary Rich wrote: “The pain and anguish that comes from seeing your murdered son’s life and legacy treated as a mere political football is beyond comprehension.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Famine Stalks South Sudan,"Editorial In the catalog of horrors afflicting the world’s most hellish places, South Sudan can check about every bloodied box. More than four years of civil warfare has left tens of thousands dead, two million displaced, half the population at threat of starvation without aid and a trail of atrocities — genocide, child warriors, rape, castration, burned villages. And now, warns the United Nations, famine stalks the tortured land. A recent report by the United Nations and the South Sudan government said 150,000 people could slip into famine this year. A formal famine declaration means people have already started to starve to death. But even with food aid, humanitarian workers warn, much of South Sudan could face severe hunger by May. And the U.N. response plan has received less than 4 percent of its 2018 funding. A year ago, South Sudan declared famine in two regions, but international responses checked it. Even if that were repeated this year, famine will be a threat in the future unless the land’s predatory soldiers are driven out. This is caused by the struggle for power and loot, not by nature. With so many conflicts around the globe, it is not surprising that those like South Sudan’s attract attention only when they rise to horrific levels. But South Sudan has the dubious distinction of being the world’s youngest state and the one most likely to fail. The latter status is bestowed by the Fund for Peace, a nongovernmental organization that compiles an annual Fragile States Index listing countries most vulnerable to collapse. Even more salient is that the United States bears a special responsibility. During the long civil war between northern and southern Sudan, which Christian groups in the United States came to perceive as a struggle of Christians in the south against Muslim oppression from the north, Washington brokered an agreement that led to independence for South Sudan in 2011 — along with billions in American aid. It all unraveled into ethnic warfare less than two years later, when President Salva Kiir, a member of the majority Dinka group, turned on his former vice president, Riek Machar, a Nuer. Other tribes joined in, setting off a senseless war that has defied numerous agreements and cease-fires. Its illusions shattered, the United States recently called for a United Nations Security Council arms embargo, while the American ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, declared that Washington had “given up” on Mr. Kiir. An arms embargo is a must, and the United States must continue to press for one in the Security Council. Washington should also continue to lead the way in providing emergency assistance. Beyond that, it would be good if European donors and the African Union joined Ms. Haley in letting Mr. Kiir, and Mr. Machar, know that they are far too big a part of the problem to ever become part of the solution.",The New York Times
2018,"Far From Home and Censors, Some Chinese Students Protest Xi’s Power Move","Chinese students have become a significant part of American college life, but they generally have shied away from the political activism of many of their classmates. Some of them, indeed, embrace the party line of the Chinese government, joining student organizations closely aligned with their local consulates. So it was all the more unusual when posters began appearing at several colleges this week in protest of a proposal in Beijing that would let China’s president, Xi Jinping, serve indefinitely. “Never My President” said the poster that Longxiao Li, 24, put up on Thursday in the library at New York University’s MetroTech campus in Brooklyn. The words were superimposed over a face of Mr. Xi, and were a reference, Mr. Li said, to the lack of democratic elections in China. “The Chinese Communist Party is an authoritarian dictatorship,” Mr. Li, 24, a graduate student in game design from Shenzhen, said in a telephone interview on Friday. “He’s never been my president. No one ever elected him.” With a vote scheduled for Sunday in the National People’s Congress to remove presidential term limits, the small campus protests seemed unlikely to cause even a ripple in China. But it was a reflection of simmering dissent among Chinese citizens, and of a willingness to speak out publicly by those outside the reach of government censors. Mr. Li said he felt an obligation to take action, despite possible repercussions if he returned home, after learning of a similar protest at the University of California, San Diego, that has also spread to other campuses, and of an accompanying Twitter campaign. The Twitter handle — @stopxijinping — was started March 1 and had gained more than 1,350 followers by the end of the week as well as a retweet by Senator Marco Rubio’s office, which called it a “bold move.” Efforts to reach the people behind that campaign were unsuccessful. The Twitter account, along with others, posted photographs of posters spotted at American universities including Arizona State, Connecticut, Georgia, Emory, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, and Syracuse; and overseas schools including the London School of Economics, Australian National University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The number of Chinese students in the United States has exploded over the last 15 years, as American colleges have tapped into China’s ascendant upper class as a major source of revenue. They are by far the largest contingent of international students, with more than 300,000 studying in the United States every year. But despite a prevailing silence on political matters, they are not a monolithic group. Those who openly joined the protest last week include Sulaiman Gu, a Ph.D. candidate in chemistry at the University of Georgia who identifies as a dissident and a Hui, a Muslim ethnic minority. He is involved in a group called the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars. Students at the University of California, San Diego, said that they had spotted posters earlier this week at the Price Center, a student center and food court. An English-language version was still up on Friday, but a Chinese version had been removed, according to Charlie Vest, a graduate student in Chinese economic and political affairs. In the past, pro-Beijing students in the United States have mounted counterprotests against students or speakers, like the Dalai Lama, who openly criticize or are seen as threats to the government. How broadly the protests were spreading at each college was unclear. Shiwei Terry Zhou, a senior at U.C. San Diego from Wuhan, said that while some posters had been placed on the campus, he did not think the campaign was having much influence. “Most students are not anti-Xi as far as I know (they really just don’t care),” he said via a Facebook message. Perry Link, a China scholar at the University of California, Riverside, said that such activism was more common immediately after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, after which Congress passed a law letting any Chinese student who feared retribution upon return to China to apply immediately for United States residency. “This rule actually became an incentive for students to speak out, since many were hoping to get green cards in any case,” Dr. Link said. “But in recent years the external incentives have been powerfully in the opposite direction,” he said, making it unusual for Chinese students in the United States to protest. In an interview Friday with Radio Free Asia, a United States-funded news service focused on Asian countries, Mr. Li, speaking in Chinese, said he believed he had an obligation to make a difference. He argued that one-party rule was not only doing harm to China, but also was threatening the free world, as China was now exporting the ideology that “authoritarianism is better than democracy.” Mr. Li, who earned a bachelor’s degree from Ohio State University before enrolling at N.Y.U., said later that while he had heard many Chinese students in the United States expressing their objections to the removal of term limits, only a few were willing to speak out publicly. “I don’t think many Chinese students are aware of this movement,” he said.

Snap, the maker of Snapchat, has been dogged by sluggish user growth since it hit the market last summer; its stock price is still below its $17 I.P.O. price. Blue Apron, the meal delivery start-up, is also trading far below what investors paid for its stock last June. The apparel retailer Stitch Fix, meanwhile, has gained some ground since its I.P.O. in November, but only barely. Now Spotify thinks it can buck the trend. After months of windup, the music-streaming company filed documents this week to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange. It isn’t doing an initial public offering but instead a novel model called a direct stock listing — but let’s forget about the mechanics for now and consider its prospects. On the surface, it looks like a tough road for Spotify. The company is beset by wealthy competitors, is losing tons of money, and its business model does not offer an obvious path to huge profits. But it has one thing going for it, and it’s huge: Spotify is excellent at what it does. None of its competitors match its pace of innovation and its wide cross-platform functionality. And although many musicians remain suspicious of Spotify, it offers the best path forward for the industry — a chance to thrive outside the cross hairs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook. Spotify’s filings suggest strong growth. The company has 159 million active users, 71 million of whom pay for a subscription to its ad-free service. Its revenue in 2017 was almost $5 billion, up 38.6 percent from the year before. But its losses also piled up; its operating loss was $461 million in 2017, up slightly from $426 million in 2016. There’s a path here to success. Spotify’s grand theory is that as it grows, it can negotiate better rates with music labels, which then increases its chance of profitability. That’s happening — its gross margin is rising — but slowly. And it’s always going to have huge content costs; Spotify has to pay for music every time it’s streamed, whereas video streaming companies like Netflix usually pay for content just once. But Spotify is worth rooting for. It’s one of few examples of a thriving consumer company that sits outside the clutches of large American tech firms. (It’s based in Sweden.) Its independence makes it great for consumers — Spotify works just about everywhere, from your iPhone to your Amazon Echo to your cheapo Android tablet. Because music streaming is all the company does, it has an incentive to keep improving its service; Spotify, I’ve noticed, adds excellent features faster than most of its bigger competitors add basic ones. That’s the best reason to hope it survives. Last month, I asked readers to send in ideas for tech stories they’d like to see covered in The Times. I expected to get a handful of responses; instead we were inundated with hundreds of thoughtful suggestions. And I read all of them! Thankfully, most of you were brief. So, what would you like to see more of? A lot of things, it turns out. Many people were interested in cryptocurrencies and the blockchains behind them. What did they want to know? The basics, really, like what’s the deal with cryptocurrencies, what is a blockchain and why is everybody suddenly talking about both? We actually have some great explainers by our Bitcoin reporter, Nathaniel Popper — and stay tuned for more. There was also a lot of interest in “algorithmic bias,” the suspicion that the computers making so many decisions about our lives might not be fair or transparent. Readers were also interested in technologies for people who aren’t thought of as a natural audience for new tech — older people, for example, or people in rural areas. “Don’t overlook the folks who are being left behind,” said Michael Starks of Zionsville, Ind. Many had concerns about security. They wondered if the cloud was really secure, and if there was anything they could do to make themselves safer online. That’s an area Times reporters are constantly digging into, but for now, the brief answer is: You’re never as safe as companies say you are. Finally, there was an interest in up-and-coming tech, even tech that’s way out there. Important as they are, people are sick of hearing about Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Twitter. They want to know about quantum computers, flying cars (oh, look, we got you covered there), any manner of robots and the start-ups behind them. And even beyond that: “All these billionaires, yet no one is making serious ground on time machines or teleportation?” asked one reader. Good question! So, some news: This will be my last newsletter for a few months. Like my nemesis Mike Isaac, I’m going to write a book about my hobbyhorse — how Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are conquering the world. When I get back, I hope they put me on the time travel beat. See you then! Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art.

2018,Fashion Parties With the French President,"Fashion Review PARIS — On the penultimate night of fashion month, amid the final paroxysms of designers attempting to define how women want to look today, there was a show of a different kind. Emmanuel Macron, president of France, and his wife, Brigitte, hosted a dinner at the Élysée Palace in honor of the industry’s creatives. It was the fashion equivalent of the pre-Davos C.E.O. summit that Mr. Macron engineered at Versailles in January. News began to leak out early in the week. Pierpaolo Piccioli, creative director of Valentino, who had come to Paris without a suit and had to go shopping at the Valentino boutique, emailed Haider Ackermann, creative director of Berluti: “Are you going to the dinner at the Élysée?” “What dinner?” Mr. Ackermann replied. Then he got the invite. He had gone to Los Angeles directly after his own label’s show on Saturday to dress Timothée Chalamet and Mahershala Ali in Berluti for the Oscars, so after he got them ready, he got back on a plane and flew home. He wasn’t going to miss this one. It was a big deal. French fashion hadn’t had this kind of official recognition from the head of state since François Mitterrand was president in the 1980s (another ‘80s revival trend! It’s inescapable). Natacha Ramsay-Levi of Chloé introduced herself to Clare Waight Keller, formerly of Chloé and now of Givenchy, because they had never met. Alber Elbaz hobnobbed with Vivienne Westwood. Joseph Altuzarra hung out with Olivier Theyskens. At the head table, Thom Browne sat near Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, who sat cater-corner to Simon Porte Jacquemus and across from Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior. And so on. 54 Photos View Slide Show › Among the very few designers missing were Nicolas Ghesquière of Louis Vuitton and Karl Lagerfeld of Chanel, but then both had shows on the final day. It was O.K.: They were represented by their work. Mrs. Macron was wearing an elaborate Louis XVI coat from Mr. Ghesquière’s last collection, much to the amusement of some guests (“You know what happened to that king,” one said) — though she accessorized it with her own high heels, as opposed to the runway sneakers. Anna Wintour was wearing Chanel. Before dinner (and after the family photo), Mr. Macron made a speech welcoming everyone and encouraging them to “choose France.” “My deepest wish is that creators, whether they come from India, Japan, Africa, the United States or China, will consider coming to our country,” he said, adding that at a time of looming threat and rising nationalism, his choice was to “be more open,” to “believe in Europe and globalization,” because those values were French values, and fashion was, and could be, part of that. In a room full of designers from all over — many of whom had indeed made Paris their adopted city — it struck a chord. But then, it’s been a strikingly diverse season, in terms of both the model lineup, which seems to have genuinely become more variegated, and the clothes. Change is on everyone’s mind: good, bad, what have you. You could see it on the catwalks that sandwiched the evening. 42 Photos View Slide Show › You could see it, for example, on the afternoon before the dinner at Giambattista Valli, king of the high/low party dress, who opened his show not with a flirt of chiffon but with a dark denim boiler suit, and then interspersed among the floral frippery and sequined minidresses some 1970s leathers, mini knit vests and long, narrow traveling coats. It’s a promising direction: Here’s hoping he does more of it, and that he has the courage to leave some of the ruffles behind. You could see it at Alexander McQueen, where Sarah Burton (who went almost straight from her catwalk bow to her place at the table close to Mr. Macron) took the idea of metamorphosis, of emerging from the chrysalis, both literally and elegantly. 81 Photos View Slide Show › Tuxedo suits emerged from the exploded bindings of red leather corsetry. Silk dresses and coats were marked by monarch prints. A quilted green leather parka had a collar that folded down to frame the neck, like the upper wings of a butterfly; zippers undone at the waist dropped the coat’s skirt, suggesting the lower parts. Elaborately embroidered iridescent jeweled scarabs covered the body of a sheer tulle dress. Floor-length silk fringe created a motile surface on capes and gowns, ever adrift in the wind. A pink taffeta minidress sprouted two enormous ruffs at the shoulders. They looked as though they were about to start flapping and fly away. And you could see it Chanel, held the morning after the dinner, though Mr. Lagerfeld had a more somber transition on the mind. Specifically a seasonal transition, a once-upon-a-time thing that seems almost shrouded in myth these days. So he took his audience, and his collection, into the woods in his usual way. The floor of the Grand Palais was strewn with browning, fallen leaves and tufts of moss, and surrounded by walls papered with pictures of a bare-limbed forest. The slightly sweet, cloying fragrance of rotting foliage hung in the air. In the middle, a row of lone oaks stood, dwarfing the models as they appeared, striding in flat shoes and boots mottled in gold and bronze leaf. Their twiglike silhouettes were drawn by long, lean skirts and short boxy jackets, or tunics with unstructured peplums at the hips over straight knee-length skirts. The colors — in soft knits and tufted furs and tweed bouclés and one Matisse-like leaf print — faded into the ground like natural camouflage. At the end, a series of lacy dresses under Chanelized puffer jackets looked so delicate they could crumble at a touch, as if to remind everyone that change marks not only a beginning, but an ending. Not that anyone was really thinking like that at the Élysée, where Mr. Macron happily took selfies as requested and where the dinner was buffet, so everyone was forced to mill around and mix and not stand on protocol. And where, in perhaps the most unexpected fashion moment of the night, Stella McCartney Facetimed her father, Paul McCartney, so he could speak to Mr. Macron, and everyone converged, in a fit of fandom for both, around her phone.",The New York Times
2018,Fatal Tesla Crash Raises New Questions About Autopilot System,"In the fall of 2016, Tesla beamed new software over the air to cars on the road in the United States and elsewhere that added safeguards to its Autopilot system to prevent drivers from looking away from the road or keeping their hands off the steering wheel for long periods of time. The move came in the wake of a crash in Florida in which an Ohio man died when his Model S sedan hit a tractor-trailer while Autopilot was engaged. Federal investigators found that the driver’s hands had been on the steering wheel for only a few seconds in the minute before the crash. When the upgrades were released, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the new Autopilot system was “really going to be beyond what people expect” and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle the safest cars on the road “by far.” Now, however, Tesla’s semiautonomous driving system is coming under new scrutiny after the company disclosed late on Friday that a fatal crash on March 23 in California occurred while Autopilot was engaged. The company said the driver, Wei Huang, 38, a software engineer for Apple, had received several visual and audible warnings to put his hands back on the steering wheel but had failed to do so, even though his Model X S.U.V. had the modified version of the software. His hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds before his Model X slammed into a concrete divider near the junction of Highway 101 and 85 in Mountain View, and neither Mr. Huang nor the Autopilot activated the brakes before the crash. The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe. “At the very least, I think there will have to be fundamental changes to Autopilot,” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who focuses on self-driving technology. “The system as it is now tricks you into thinking it has more capability than it does. It’s not an autonomous system. It’s not a hands-free system. But that’s how people are using it, and it works fine, until it suddenly doesn’t.” On Saturday, Tesla declined to comment on the California crash or to make Mr. Musk or another executive available for an interview. In its blog post on Friday about the crash, the company acknowledged that Autopilot “does not prevent all accidents,” but said the system “makes them much less likely to occur” and “unequivocally makes the world safer.” For the company, the significance of the crash goes beyond Autopilot. Tesla is already reeling from a barrage of negative news. The value of its stock and bonds has plunged amid increasing concerns about how much cash it is using up and the repeated delays in the production of the Model 3, a battery-powered compact car that Mr. Musk is counting on to generate much-needed revenue. It is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman. Meanwhile, competition is mounting from other luxury car makers that have developed their own electric cars, while Waymo, the Google spinoff, General Motors and others seem to have passed Tesla in self-driving technology. “There’s a lot going on that undermines Elon’s credibility right now,” said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. Autopilot uses radar and cameras to detect lane markings, other vehicles and objects in the road. It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot — despite the implications in its name — is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own. Drivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner’s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a “beta” version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage. At the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot’s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky. Software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts. The new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky. Autopilot does not use lidar — a kind of radar based on lasers — that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe. At least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway. The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot “played a major role,” and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers. An earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company’s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled. That inquiry, however, focused only on the question of whether any flaws in the system had led to the crash; it found no such flaws.",The New York Times
2018,Father Recalls the Day His Children Were Killed by Their Nanny,"Kevin Krim knew something was wrong when his flight from the West Coast landed at Kennedy Airport and his telephone blew up with messages from friends, asking if he was all right. Then the captain announced that the police needed to take someone off the plane. A flight attendant tapped his arm and asked to him to come forward to a galley. His telephone rang. It was his brother-in-law, saying something had happened to his children. “I sat down in the galley,” he recalled as he testified at his former nanny’s murder trial on Tuesday. “It’s the worst thing imaginable. I was hoping this is just a nightmare and it wasn’t.” Two police officers escorted Mr. Krim off the plane and drove him to what was then known as St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center, saying nothing. At the hospital, a doctor informed him that two of his children, Leo, 2, and Lucia, 6, were dead. “I was crying, kind of flailing around,” he said. “I was asking: ‘What happened? What happened?’” That was when someone told him that Yoselyn Ortega, a woman he and his wife had employed for two years as a nanny and had taken pains to help financially, had killed his children. Until Tuesday, Mr. Krim had not seen Ms. Ortega since that day — Oct. 25, 2012. Asked to identify her, he raised his eyes and pointed at her sitting at the defense table in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, his jaw tight and his mouth curved down. She did not return his gaze. Ms. Ortega, 55, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and faces life in prison if convicted. She has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and her trial has turned largely on questions about her mental health. That evening, she was found in the bathroom of the Krim family’s apartment on West 75th Street. Lucia and Leo lay dead in a bloody tub, stabbed repeatedly. A kitchen knife was in the sink. Ms. Ortega had plunged a second knife into her own throat in a suicide attempt. Mr. Krim, 42, a media executive, said he and his wife, Marina, had decided to hire a nanny in 2010 when she was pregnant with Leo, their third child. He pushed for it, he said. He was working 12-hour days and his wife was overloaded. They first heard about Ms. Ortega when her sister Celia Ortega approached Ms. Krim, visibly pregnant, during Lucia’s ballet class at the Jewish Community Center. She said Ms. Ortega was an experienced nanny. That turned out to be untrue, Mr. Krim said. But Ms. Ortega provided the Krims with a phony reference, a woman who vouched for Ms. Ortega in an emailed letter, giving glowing answers to a long list of questions from the Krims. “The answers we got back were all a lie,” Mr. Krim said. “Every single one.” Mr. Krim, who has two family members with schizophrenia, said he never saw any signs Ms. Ortega had a mental illness. “Absolutely not, never,” he said. But Mr. Krim said he knew Ms. Ortega was under financial strain. She had rented a new apartment and had moved her teenage son from the Dominican Republic to New York City, placing him in an expensive private school. He and his wife offered her extra hours cleaning their apartment. They paid for her to take at least two trips to the Dominican Republic to deal with family emergencies, treating the cost as a bonus of sorts. They employed her son for odd jobs, like walking the dog, and sometimes employed her sister Daisy. They even recommended her to some friends who needed a nanny for a month while they were out of town. “We knew there was financial pressure and we wanted to find her more ways to make money,” he said. “There was always this theme that I was pushing hard on: ‘Let’s make sure she’s happy, that she wants to keep working for us.’” Mr. Krim said that Ms. Ortega was generally a reliable employee and that he did not want to lose her because it would disrupt his children’s lives. “She did her job well,” he said on cross-examination. Yet he testified that he noticed nothing in Ms. Ortega’s behavior that would have predicted what happened on Oct. 25, 2012. That night, at the hospital, he recalled that he was led into a room where his wife, wrung out from weeping, fell into his arms. She had returned home about 5:30 p.m., carrying her middle child, Nessie, after Ms. Ortega failed to show up with Lucia for a dance class and found her children dead. “I hugged her and she said ‘Kevin, we are not going to get divorced over this,’” he recalled. “‘Oprah always said people get divorced after they lose kids.’” Mr. Krim said he told doctors he wanted to see his children. He and his wife entered a tiny examination room, the two children on gurneys. Nurses had quickly cleaned their bodies and wrapped them in sheets up to their chins, he said. “And they were beautiful and strange,” he said. “They were the wrong color. They didn’t have any blood left in them so they were bluish. But they had this perfect skin and their long eyelashes. They had this, like, sandy brown hair. You could see they tried really hard to wash the blood out but it still had kind of an auburn tint to it that I remember to this day.” “I got down on my knees and I said I’m sorry,” Mr. Krim said. “I said I love you and kissed them and said goodbye.” “It’s worst thing you can imagine,” he added. Then he dabbed his eyes.",The New York Times
2018,"Fearing New Outbreaks, Brazil Will Vaccinate Country Against Yellow Fever","SÃO PAULO — Hoping to stave off another deadly outbreak of yellow fever, Brazil’s government announced on Tuesday that it planned to vaccinate the entire country against the mosquito-borne virus by April 2019. The country of 208 million is grappling with the worst outbreak of yellow fever in decades. So far this year, 300 people, including several tourists, have died from the virus, which has hit the outlying areas of the country’s largest cities, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, particularly hard, threatening to become this country’s first-blown urban epidemic since 1942. “We are going to act preventively instead of reacting with emergency measures as we have done,” Health Minister Ricardo Barros said at a news conference in Brasília, where he announced that health officials would need to vaccinate an additional 77.5 million people to reach the country’s entire population by April of next year. The disease, normally found in the Amazon River Basin, broke out of its usual pattern in early 2016 and started moving south and east toward the country’s largest cities, prompting the declaration of a public health emergency last year. Some Brazilians panicked and began killing monkeys in urban parks in the mistaken belief that doing so would slow the spread of the virus. Even though mosquitoes transmit the virus, monkeys are often the first victims of yellow fever and a strong indicator of the presence of the virus. Yellow fever did not make it to urban centers last year, and when cases dropped off during the cooler winter months, Mr. Barros declared the outbreak over. Despite that, he said at the time that vaccination efforts would be stepped up. But critics say health officials failed to act aggressively enough, which left them scrambling when the virus appeared near São Paulo, Brazil’s biggest city, in this latest outbreak. Efforts to vaccinate 23 million people this year have been hampered by false rumors about the vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently raised its alert level for visitors to Brazil and urged travelers to get vaccinations first. “We don’t want this to happen again next year, and the best preparation is vaccination,” Adeilson Loureiro Cavalcante, head of the Health Ministry’s prevention unit, said at the news conference. The virus kills 3 to 8 percent of those who are infected, but the vaccine, while highly effective, is not harmless. About one recipient in 100,000 suffers a dangerous reaction like jaundice or hepatitis and in rare cases, the vaccine has killed recipients. Until now, Brazilian officials had ruled that given yellow fever’s limited reach, it was not worth the risk to vaccinate the entire population. The nationwide vaccination campaign will be rolled out gradually, initially focused on São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia States, where health officials have been administering partial doses with one-fifth the normal vaccine because of shortages of stock.",The New York Times
2018,February in Live Jazz: 5 Standout Shows,"Welcome to “The Month in Live Jazz,” a column highlighting five standout performances from the past month on stages across New York City. DAVE DOUGLAS Jazz at Lincoln Center, Feb. 24 It’s always been convenient to frame the trumpeter Dave Douglas as an anti-traditionalist, but he’s more of a roving archaeologist, exhuming and examining various strands of musical history without declaring any singular allegiance. On Saturday at the Appel Room, he led an intergenerational sextet in an investigation of Dizzy Gillespie’s legacy. The set included both deconstructions of Gillespie’s repertoire and Douglas originals inspired by his famed trumpet forebear. In “Manteca,” Gillespie’s seminal Latin-jazz composition, Ambrose Akinmusire, playing second trumpet, made the strongest statement. His brief solo was a saber stream of bluesy invocation, loud and wide-awake. (Douglas’s arrangements didn’t allow for many long-form solos, a revision to the bebop idiom that emphasized both the arrangement and the ensemble’s spontaneous interplay.) As the tune simmered toward senescence, Mr. Akinmusire, 35, used circular breathing to hold a long tone while the guitarist Bill Frisell responded with gentle, sustained notes in the upper register. The drummer Joey Baron scraped tones off the surfaces of his cymbals, and Mr. Akinmusire started making blustery smacks into his mouthpiece. Then he pulled it out and clacked it around in the bell of the horn. The audience was laughing some, but it was bewildered too. There was Gillespie’s legacy for you: an entertainer who could entwine gravitas and levity, an ambassador for the younger generation’s attitudes, frustrations and will toward self-representation. Dave Douglas performs at the Village Vanguard with Joe Lovano from June 12-17. DAVID MURRAY INFINITY QUARTET Birdland, Feb. 1 The tenor saxophonist David Murray’s new album, “Blues for Memo,” is centered on the emphatic poetry of Saul Williams. It works as a sharp inoculation against establishment wisdom, delivered in the guise of a blues-battered jazz recording. Mr. Murray, 63, an outré jazz eminence who recently moved back to New York after years of living in Europe, is no stranger to literary collaborations, or to bending the rules of straight-ahead jazz to suit his idiosyncrasies. His thick tone — with a tremulous vibrato and a constant urge to scrape its way higher into the atmosphere — sounds like the synthesis of a broad jazz tradition, and also like no other musician. Mr. Murray played a week at Birdland recently, joined by his quartet but not Mr. Williams. Even without the poetry, the group made its points clear. Mr. Murray rendered Billy Strayhorn’s ballad “Chelsea Bridge” without any undue sentimentality, checking his tremolo just a bit. And on original tunes from the album, the drummer Nasheet Waits played in his brawny, aerated style, matching Mr. Murray’s warped pronouncements and rough urgency. The David Murray Infinity Quartet’s latest album, “Blues for Memo,” featuring the poet Saul Williams, is out on Motéma Records. AMIRTHA KIDAMBI Roulette, Feb. 27 Sometimes the eye of a storm can draw upon the chaos around it, taking on its energy and consolidating it for use. Something like that is going on in Elder Ones, the quartet led by the vocalist and harmonium player Amirtha Kidambi. She creates drones on the harmonium — an old, air-powered keyboard — and coaxes her bandmates into ripping them apart. Then her voice funnels that energy out in a scorching beam. In its best moments, it’s like a mix of a Cuban sonero’s citrusy cry and a riot grrrl yowl. At Roulette, Ms. Kidambi performed a book of new material with Elder Ones — featuring Matt Nelson on soprano saxophone, Nick Dunston on bass and Max Jaffe on drums — which released a strong CD, “Holy Science,” in 2016. The band abided by a turbulent pact, Mr. Nelson painting in vertical streaks as the rhythm section pried at its own foundations. Ms. Kidambi also performed a solo set, accompanying her voice with belled bangles on her ankles (the ghungroo, a traditional Indian accouterment) and, for the latter half of each piece, the harmonium. The songs, comprising a new suite she’s calling “Yajna” (or “ritual of fire”), all centered on direct phrases: “They step on those beneath in the name of progress,” or, in one inspired by the life and death of Erica Garner, “The system breaks her heart.” Without the tousled kinetics of the band, Ms. Kidambi worked hard to create a full context. To a degree, the specificity and the fury felt healthy, and important. We need more of this. But the lyrics were intentionally unambiguous, leaving little room for imagination. And in the way she hurtled them straight and hard at the audience, you couldn’t help feeling as if you were receiving something impervious and final. It was hard to tap into a sense of catharsis, or find your way into the sound. As she develops these pieces, Ms. Kidambi may work to ensure that her solo music feels more like a caldron of activity and possibility — frightening listeners and beckoning them at the same time — like her music with Elder Ones often does. Ms. Kidambi continues her residency at Roulette on June 17, performing in a vocal quintet and a duo with the saxophonist Lea Bertucci. FOUR SIMULTANEOUS SOLOISTS Pioneer Works, Feb. 2 In the main gallery at Pioneer Works in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in an exhibition titled “Solid Light Works,” the artist Anthony McCall has four vertical light sculptures on display. In an almost pitch-black room, the pearly drapes of light descend from a high ceiling in irregular, conical shapes, making stark outlines on the black carpet. Each immaterial sculpture has a distinct allure and form, but as you walk under and through them, their effects become related. Your eyes adjust and readjust; your body enters into the light; your movement throughout the space connects the four pieces. A similar logic took hold on Feb. 2 as you listened to the music in the second of four performances titled “Four Simultaneous Soloists.” In the gallery, the pedal steel guitarist Susan Alcorn, the drummer Eli Keszler, the cellist Tomeka Reid and the trumpeter Nate Wooley each sat beside one of the four vertical light sculptures, improvising freely as attendees circled slowly around them or sat beneath the fallen lights. Couples found it hard not to embrace or lay down together in an unselfconscious tangle. The “soloists” played quietly, matching the darkness around them, and they could only catch snatches and inklings of what the others were playing. Ms. Alcorn and Mr. Keszler were at opposite ends of the long gallery; whatever information they received from each other came almost completely through Ms. Reid and Mr. Wooley. Thinking it through, you might have been drawn to wander. Why sit and hear Ms. Alcorn’s simple, slowly exhaled harmonies when across the room Mr. Wooley was playing fabulous long tones, blowing into what looked like a sheet of metal and making a music of blistery reconstitution? But ultimately, your body won out. It wanted you to find an arbitrary vantage and sit still, allowing the shape of the room and the vague drift of sound to determine what you heard. The final Four Simultaneous Soloists performance takes place on Friday, featuring Jules Gimbrone playing objects and electronics, Okkyung Lee on cello, Chris McIntyre on trombone and synthesizer, and Yoshi Wada on bagpipes and sirens. ANAT FORT QUARTET Cornelia Street Café, Feb. 20 Most of the tunes that the Anat Fort Quartet played at Cornelia Street Café last week came from the group’s most recent album on ECM Records, “Birdwatching.” But something new emerged. On the album, Ms. Fort draws elliptical harmonies around the clarinet sound of Gianluigi Trovesi, a distant and ephemeral player. But at Cornelia, her sparring partner was the alto saxophonist Michael Attias, and the pair drove each other into a flintier exchange. Midway through “Song of the Phoenix,” Ms. Fort took a solo in the low-middle range that had a kind of generative fury, body and fire united. Then, on a freshly composed Fort original, provisionally titled “Sort Of,” Mr. Attias took a solo that exhibited his roughly chiseled attack, answering Ms. Fort’s provocation. Even the lovely or dreamlike moments had a sense of hard-won embodiment and purpose. That tune was followed by “Murmuration,” from the album. As Mr. Attias’s solo neared its summit, Ms. Fort drove her rhythm section — the bassist Gary Wang and the drummer Rudy Royston — toward a splintered dissolution. Her chords had the bright payoff of internal octaves as well as the acrid carp of dissonance. Altogether, the group was finding a new cooperative language, sometimes hitting a sputtering stride, sometimes avoiding cohesion altogether. The Anat Fort Quartet returns to the Cornelia Street Café on April 13.",The New York Times

Changes are coming to the so-called Volcker Rule, the post-financial crisis era measure intended to rein in aggressive trading by Wall Street banks. The Federal Reserve is in the process of working with other regulatory agencies to make “material changes” to the rule. Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, said the central bank is working toward rewriting portions of the Volcker Rule during a speech on Monday. Mr. Quarles took issue with many parts of the rule — inspired by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Quarles said the rule was “an example of a complex regulation that is not working well,” and that the Fed is working on revisions to make the rule less burdensome to firms that do not have large trading desks. Mr. Quarles did not give a time-frame to revise the rule but said the Fed’s goal was to write something that would formally be submitted for public comment. He said regulators want to make “clearer and more transparent” what kind of trading is governed by the Volcker Rule — something he said has been a source of frustration for regulators and bankers. The Volcker Rule has been credited with curtailing the ability of banks to make risky and speculative trades for their own account — which some contend contributed to some of the excesses that led up to the financial crisis of a decade ago. — Matthew Goldstein The Federal Reserve is gearing up for a far-reaching overhaul of the Volcker Rule. The rule’s critics, including Randal K. Quarles, head of supervision at the Fed, say it is too burdensome on banks. But there may be one group of people who hope that the Fed doesn’t gut the rule: Investors in bank stocks. Since the Volcker Rule took effect in 2015, they’ve been able to worry much less about traders saddling their institutions with overwhelming losses. In fact, there hasn’t been a big trading meltdown at a large United States bank since the London Whale debacle at JPMorgan Chase, which happened prior to 2015 and arguably lit a fire under regulators to finalize the rule. Contrary to some analyses of the financial crisis, proprietary trading contributed to the weakness of financial system . Who can forget Morgan Stanley’s disastrous subprime wager that saddled the bank with $9 billion of losses? And by shedding proprietary traders, banks may have dodged no end of bullets. When a star commodities trader, Andrew J. Hall, left Citigroup, there was concern that the bank lost a crucial money maker. But the hedge fund Mr. Hall ran after he left Citigroup suffered outsize losses. And the list of bank traders who later racked up big losses at hedge funds is not short. — Peter Eavis The retailer has rejected its founding family’s takeover offer. A group of Nordstrom family members, which control 21 percent of the company, had offered $50 a share for the shares it does not already own. The Special Committee has directed its advisors and management not to provide further due diligence information to the Group. Furthermore, unless the Group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the Company, the Special Committee intends to terminate discussions. It was a brash move, even by Wall Street’s standards. Deutsche Bank, a giant German bank with a big trading business in the United States, took emergency loans from the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis a decade ago. But later, Deutsche Bank changed the legal classification of its Wall Street operations, a step that for a time shielded it from United States banking regulations. Deutsche Bank’s actions, and those of other large foreign banks during that period, now loom over a piece of banking deregulation legislation that the Senate may approve this week. The bill loosens the part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 overhaul of the United States financial system, that imposed stricter regulations on larger banks, including foreign ones. Specifically, the bill — sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho — would lighten the regulation of banks that have less than $250 billion in loans, securities and other assets, a group that includes American banks like SunTrust and BB&T. But the bill’s critics are concerned that it would allow far larger foreign banks to chip away at rules designed to prevent them wriggling out of United States safeguards. The authors of the new bill reject such fears. “Folks are peddling a lot of misinformation about our bipartisan bill, but if you look at the bill text you will see that large foreign banks will be subject to the same enhanced prudential standards,” Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. “Our legislation provides targeted regulatory relief for local lenders in Montana and rural America.” (“Enhanced prudential standards” is the regulatory term for stricter rules.) And the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, speaking before a Senate committee last week, said he did not think the bill would allow foreign banks to operate under a softer set of rules. Mr. Powell based his assertion on how Dodd-Frank is written. It states that banks over $50 billion in consolidated assets require stricter oversight. The new bill moves that up to $250 billion. But even though the likes of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have less than $250 billion in United States assets, they have far more than that on a consolidated basis around the world. And since the new bill does not amend the part of Dodd-Frank that requires regulators to use consolidated assets, the Fed can continue to apply its enhanced regulations to foreign banks. So, why are opponents of the bill, like Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, concerned? They point to remarks made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Congress earlier this year. When Senator Brown asked Mr. Mnuchin if he believed the new bill would reduce regulations for foreign banks, he said: “That is correct.” Indeed, the Treasury, when it set out its aims in a report last year for reducing financial regulations, included relief for foreign banks. (A Treasury official on Monday sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin’s answer to Senator Brown. The official said Mr. Mnuchin was responding to the senator’s remarks about the Treasury’s report that came before his question about the impact of Senator Crapo’s bill.) Critics also point out that the Fed in part based its post-crisis rules for foreign banks on language in Dodd-Frank that required the rules establish fair competition between foreign and domestic banks. If the bill passes, and the Fed gives foreign banks no relief from certain regulations, the foreign banks could argue in a lawsuit that they are competitively disadvantaged against American banks with assets under $250 billion that did get such relief, some opponents of the bill contend. And the Fed did in one place veer from using consolidated assets when applying regulations to foreign banks. The Fed in 2014 said that foreign banks with less than $50 billion in United States assets (not a global consolidated measure) would be eligible for less stringent requirements under its foreign banking rule. That could create the grounds for raising that bar for lighter regulation from to $250 billion from $50 billion, critics of the bill argue. But supporters of the bill contend that United States laws give the Fed substantial leeway to continue applying stricter regulation to foreign banks. What might happen if Senator Crapo’s bill passes? It seems unlikely that big foreign banks are going to get an immediate pass from stricter regulations. But the pre-crisis period shows that, over a longer period, banks and their lawyers press for changes when they see regulators relax. — Peter Eavis The most dramatic story in M.&A. has taken another twist — one that raises questions about how assertively the Trump administration will regulate deal-making. What happened: The U.S. government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, known as Cfius, has asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, by 30 days so it could further review Broadcom’s hostile takeover bid. Broadcom’s response pulled no punches, accusing Qualcomm of covertly reaching out to regulators: This was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom’s independent director nominees. Why: Members of Cfius have asked whether the takeover could put the U.S. behind China in the race for 5G wireless technology. Qualcomm’s biggest rival in the space is Huawei, and Qualcomm has argued that Broadcom, a serial acquirer and noted cost-cutter, could hurt crucial 5G research and development. (And Michael noted on Friday that there’s more to it than that.) Where the vote stands: Many early votes favored Broadcom: The shareholder advisory firms I.S.S. and Glass, Lewis recommended giving it at least four seats. But a top-30 investor, Parnassus, had said it supported Qualcomm. Michael hears that both sides have been especially focused on lobbying the biggest shareholders, BlackRock and Vanguard. The bigger picture: The White House has already blocked the sale of a U.S. tech company to a Chinese buyer on national security grounds. If it steps in here — in an unusually aggressive move by Cfius, which normally acts after a proposed deal is filed for review — would deal makers lose heart? The deals flyaround • Axa of France agreed to buy the XL Group, a reinsurer, for $15.3 billion in cash — the biggest takeover of a U.S. insurer by a European one.

(WSJ) • Siemens is forging ahead with an I.P.O. of its health care unit, Healthineers, that could value it at as much as $38 billion. (Bloomberg) The Infatuation is set to announce on Monday that it has bought Zagat from Google. From Michael de la Merced: The deal will bolster the profile of the nine-year-old The Infatuation. But it also raises questions about whether Zagat, once the 800-pound gorilla of restaurant recommendations, can remain relevant when a slew of younger digital competitors have emerged and thrived. Background Then Google bought Zagat seven years ago under the direction of Marissa Mayer, who went on to become Yahoo’s chief executive. The plan was to integrate it into its mapping service, but life under Google has sometimes been rocky for the business, including a de-emphasizing of Zagat content in favor of Google’s own collected recommendations. About The Infatuation The company was founded nine years ago by Chris Stang and Andrew Steinthal, who a way to recommend restaurants and bars to their friends. The company has succeeded in part by embracing technologies both new and old: It popularized “#EEEEEATS” as a branded hashtag on Instagram, and runs a slew of food-related accounts on the social network. It also rolled out Text Rex, a texting recommendation service staffed by humans to recommend eateries for users’ particular situations. The company said it became profitable last year. White House officials like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and senior trade adviser Peter Navarro asserted on the Sunday talk shows that tariffs on steel and aluminum are definitely coming — though they didn’t say when. And the move may affect more than raw metal either: Mr. Trump threatened tariffs on cars imported from the E.U. if it retaliates. (He didn’t mention the ones that Daimler and BMW make in G.O.P.-leaning Southern states.) Big question 1: How will China react? So far, it has been cautious, in part because Chinese steel makes up just 2 percent of American steel imports. U.S. allies who stand to be hit have been far more outspoken. Big question 2: Will Gary Cohn, who favors free trade but was shot down at a meeting on Thursday, finally leave the White House?

2018,Fed Raises Interest Rates for Sixth Time Since Financial Crisis,"The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled that the central bank is on track to raise rates twice more in 2018. ■ The Fed said it would raise its benchmark interest rate to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, marking the sixth time since the financial crisis that it has raised rates. ■ The Fed said at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting that the economy continues to strengthen and that it expects to increase rates another two times this year as it pursues a return to more normal interest rate levels. Officials also increased their expectations for economic growth this year in the United States, declaring that “the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.” They said they expect to raise interest rates three times next year, an increase from the two increases in 2019 that they forecast in December. ■ Jerome H. Powell, the new Fed chairman, expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly. “We’re trying to take that middle ground,” he said in a news conference following his first policy meeting as head of the central bank. Mr. Powell, a former Fed governor, succeeded Janet L. Yellen last month. The Fed, under Ms. Yellen, pursued gradual rate increases and a highly choreographed sell-off of the portfolio of bonds it bought to help prop up the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Powell was among the governors who voted for that approach, and the announcement on Wednesday signaled he will maintain it, particularly if economic growth continues to accelerate and unemployment remains at or below the 4.1 percent level it reached in February. The announcement underscores the Fed’s gathering confidence in the economy as well as its focus on the potential for inflation, which has remained persistently muted throughout the expansion. Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent in December. They raised their estimate for growth in 2019 to 2.4 percent, up from 2.1 percent. They now expect the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, a low level by historical standards. In December, officials said they expected unemployment to be 3.9 percent both this year and next. Officials’ growing optimism tracks with the expectations of many Wall Street analysts. “We think Fed officials will view the growth and inflation data in recent months as encouraging,” analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note ahead of the meeting, “particularly with tax cuts now implemented and with an additional fiscal boost from federal spending arriving this year.” Fed officials indicated they are likely to raise rates a total of three times in 2018, in keeping with their projections in December. But officials were divided, with slightly less than half indicating they expect to raise rates at least four times this year. By a slim margin, officials said they expect an additional rate increase to come in 2019, for a total of three increases that year. In his news conference, Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. “Like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,” he said. “It could change up. It could change down” Some analysts say a short-term economic stimulus from Congress — in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut and federal spending increases — could eventually push the Fed to add a fourth rate move. As expected, the bank raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday as it continues to step back from its post-crisis stimulus campaign. A portion of the voting membership of the committee rotates every year among the Fed’s regional bank presidents. The new members tend to worry more about inflation than those they replaced. Even some members who have fretted more about growth than inflation appear to be shifting their calculus. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been less hawkish than many of her colleagues, said in a speech this month that in many ways, “today is the mirror image of the environment we confronted a couple of years ago.” “In the earlier period, strong headwinds sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy,” she added. “Today, with headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could hold true.” Fed officials signaled in several ways that they see the economy strengthening. Along with raising their growth forecasts, they declared in a statement that “economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate” and that “job gains have been strong in recent months.” In January, officials described both economic activity and job growth as “solid.” The statement also declared, in a change from January, that “the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.” It said officials expect the inflation rate to move up “in coming months.” In January, officials said they expected inflation to increase “this year.” That increased optimism appears to downplay lingering uncertainties in the recovery, including structural issues like a ballooning debt load and trade barriers that could turn the economy’s tailwinds back into headwinds. Recent data suggest that economic growth is falling short of expectations for the first quarter. Wage growth appears to be improving, but the signs are mixed. Markets have been rattled in recent weeks by Mr. Trump’s tariff plans and embrace of a potential trade war. Mr. Powell emphasized the strength of the economy in the opening remarks of his news conference, while largely steering clear of topics such as President Trump’s pending tariffs and tax cuts. The new chairman highlighted strong recent monthly jobs gains, the low unemployment rate, improving labor-force participation and a fiscal boost from federal tax cuts and spending increases. He said “there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of a sudden acceleration in inflation.” He was asked repeatedly about trade, including about Mr. Trump’s coming tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and a pending administration decision to target China with a new set of tariffs and other trade actions. He said trade policy was emerging as an point of concern among business leaders who speak to Fed officials, but he downplayed the administration’s actions as an immediate threat to growth. “There’s no thought that changes in trade policy should have an effect on the current outlook,” Mr. Powell said, though he later added that officials could grow more concerned if the dispute escalates and other countries retaliate with tariffs of their own. He declined to discuss any actions related to China, whose trade practices have come under mounting criticism from the Trump administration. “We don’t do trade policy here at the Fed,” Mr. Powell said, “and I would be reluctant to comment on any particular policy with any particular country.”",The New York Times
2018,FedEx Follows Amazon Into the Robotic Future,"KERNERSVILLE, N.C. — As soon as the first robot arrived at a FedEx shipping hub in the heart of North Carolina tobacco country early last year, talk of pink slips was in the air. Workers had been driving the “tuggers” that navigated large and irregular items across the vast concrete floor of the 630,000-square-foot freight depot since it opened in 2011. Their initial robotic colleague drew a three-dimensional digital map of the place as it tugged freight around. A few months later, three other robots — nicknamed Lucky, Dusty and Ned in a nod to the movie “¡Three Amigos!” — arrived, using the digital map to get around on their own. By March, they were joined by two others, Jefe and El Guapo. Horns honking and warning lights flashing, the autonomous vehicles snaked through the hub, next to about 20 tuggers that still needed humans behind the wheel. The robot team, part of the automation trend rippling through the worlds of shipping and online retailing, was the first significant deployment of mobile robots inside a FedEx hub. Amazon and our e-commerce shopping habits are big reasons it’s happening. In 2012, Amazon acquired a robotics company called Kiva. Since then, it has moved many of that company’s robots into its network of more than 210 fulfillment and package-sorting centers. Now, many Amazon partners and competitors are moving in the same direction, including big shipping and logistics operations like FedEx and DHL. But what has happened at the FedEx hub may be a surprise to people who fear that they are about to be replaced by a smart machine: a robot might take your role, but not necessarily your job. Yes, the robots replaced a few jobs right away. And in time, they will replace about 25 jobs in a facility that employs about 1,300 people. But the hub creates about 100 new jobs every year — and a robot work force still seems like the distant future. “Everyone will have a job,” said Galen Steele, the senior manager who oversees the depot. “It just might be in a different place.” As people have become more comfortable buying online, big and bulky goods like car tires, canoes and boxes as big as a coffin have accounted for an increasing percentage of the packages flowing through FedEx’s distribution centers, said Ted Dengel, who oversees operations technology for the FedEx Ground network, which includes 35 shipping hubs across the United States and Canada, including the facility in North Carolina. These ungainly items can’t fit on a conveyor belt. That’s where the robots, which cost several thousand dollars and are made by a Massachusetts company called Vecna, come in. Kernersville, the home of the FedEx hub, sits in the middle of the North Carolina Piedmont, the plateau between the coastal lowlands in the east and the mountains in the west, in an area that used to be known as the Tobacco Road. In the 20th century, it embraced textile and apparel manufacturing. But as automation has increased inside factories and textile work has moved overseas, the local economy has sputtered. “In the middle of a boom elsewhere, things really aren’t that great here,” said Andrew Brod, senior research fellow at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, who tracks the local economy. The local unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, modestly above the 4.1 percent national rate. Mr. Brod estimates that the arrival of distribution centers like the one FedEx opened in 2011 has provided a boost, creating as many as 120,000 jobs, a majority of which go to workers with no more than a high school education. And Mr. Steele, the manager of the FedEx facility in Kernersville, did not envision pink slips when he saw the first Vecna robot. “I understand people thinking this will take their jobs,” Mr. Steele said on a recent Monday morning inside the hub. “But over time, they realize that is not the case at all.” But those fears were not unfounded. In a recent report, the McKinsey Global Institute, a business research organization, predicted that about one-third of workers in the United States will have to switch occupations because of technology-driven automation by 2030. “What people underestimate is the time needed for this to happen,” said Michael Chui, a partner with McKinsey. Workers who once spent part of their time driving tuggers might spend more time lifting boxes onto trailers or stacking those boxes inside delivery trucks bound for other parts of the country. But over all, the work force inside the hub will grow, not shrink, Mr. Steele said. For Mr. Steele, a 24-year FedEx veteran, this is just another step on a long and gradual climb toward greater automation — a march that began decades ago with automatic scanners and sorters. The North Carolina hub is already highly automated; more than 80 percent of packages move across the facility through a system of conveyor belts, scanners and sorters that needs no human labor. When a truck filled with packages arrives, workers load the bulky items onto trailers hitched to a robot. Once these trailers are full, they press a button that sends the vehicle on its way. Equipped with laser-based sensors, cameras and other navigation tools, the robots stop when people or other vehicles get in the way. In some cases, they even figure out a new way to go. But most of the work in this facility still requires human dexterity. Modern robots are not nimble enough to unload a truck filled with randomly sized boxes or pack those boxes onto a truck at the other end of the hub. “People are remarkably good at handling lots of different shapes and amazingly good at fitting those things into tight spaces,” said Dave Clark, who oversees robotics work at Amazon. “Machines, today, can’t keep pace.” These companies, however, will continue to automate as much of the process as they can. The online retail and shipping markets continue to grow, and with Amazon setting new standards for fast and inexpensive delivery, everyone else has to keep up. That means more shipping centers and more workers — both machines and humans. The need for automation is particularly acute in areas with low unemployment. RK Logistics, a small company that runs a shipping warehouse in Livermore, Calif., — with the help of three mobile robots — has had trouble hiring. The pool of available workers is low — the local unemployment rate is around 2.7 percent — and it is hard to keep up with the salaries Amazon is paying in nearby Tracy. “We have 30 positions open at any given time,” said Rock Magnan, the company’s president. And the desire of companies to rely on robots isn’t abating. FedEx is already exploring the use of robotics in the concrete yards outside its hubs, where workers move freight with forklifts and other vehicles, Mr. Dengel said. On the second floor of the North Carolina hub, where most packages race down conveyor belts, the company is preparing to install a system that can automatically recognize packages that need special handling. In the past, that also required a paid worker. After testing five Vecna robots over the past several months, FedEx said it will begin testing 20 more with an eye toward replacing all the existing tuggers. It may then expand the program into other hubs across the country. DHL has reached a similar point, after putting mobile robots from two start-ups, Locus and Fetch, into two small parts of its worldwide operations. With a six-year head start, Amazon is much further along. Mr. Clark said the company has deployed more than 100,000 Kiva robots across 26 distribution centers in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. And about 30 robotic arms, built by outside companies, are helping to lift and stow standard containers in a handful of facilities. But even inside Amazon, the need for human labor is growing much faster than the robot work force. Since acquiring Kiva and deploying its first robots, Amazon has expanded its work force by 300,000 people. “The biggest problem is not having enough people and I don’t think that is going to change,” Mr. Clark said.",The New York Times
2018,"FedEx, Facebook, Iraq: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Investigators are putting thousands of packages under intense scrutiny across Texas and appealing for help from the public after a string of mysterious bombings in the state. All five were improvised devices hidden in packages. The latest detonated early Tuesday at a FedEx facility near San Antonio, above, leaving an employee with ringing in the ears. The authorities believe the sender shipped a second suspicious package, which was turned over to law enforcement. Both packages were addressed to Austin, where the previous blasts — two of them lethal — occurred. Here’s a breakdown of each case. ____ 2. As Facebook grapples with outrage over its role in the harvesting of data from 50 million accounts, the company’s chief data security officer is on the way out. We’re told the executive, Alex Stamos, above, had pushed for more transparency but met resistance from other senior leaders. The F.T.C. is also investigating whether Facebook violated a data privacy agreement. And Cambridge Analytica, the data firm involved, has suspended its C.E.O. It worked for both the Trump and Brexit campaigns. ____ 3. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, began a two-week visit to the U.S., seeking some $35 billion in investment. Arms sales are also on his agenda. He met with President Trump at the White House, above, and plans to travel to New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, Houston and Los Angeles. Mr. Trump also phoned his congratulations to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on his re-election and said the two would meet soon. On “The Daily,” our former Moscow correspondent describes the trajectory of Mr. Putin’s life and rise to power. ____ 4. Another woman who claims she had an affair with President Trump has sued to be released from a nondisclosure agreement. Karen McDougal, above, is a former Playboy model and a fitness specialist. She’s suing the company that owns The National Enquirer, which paid her $150,000 in what may have been an effort to “catch and kill” her story. She says she was misled by her own lawyer and tricked into signing the agreement. ____ 5. The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case about a California law that requires “crisis pregnancy centers” to provide information on abortion. The centers, which are often affiliated with religious groups, seek to persuade women to choose parenting or put their child up for adoption. They say a law requiring them to post notices about the option to abort violates their own right to free speech. Above, opponents of the law demonstrated outside the court. ____ 6. Another school shooting, this time in southern Maryland. A 17-year-old male student appeared in a hallway at a high school in Great Mills, pulled out a handgun and opened fire on a girl he knew, spurring a deputy stationed there to confront him.

2018,Federal Agency Courted Alcohol Industry to Fund Study on Benefits of Moderate Drinking,"Scientists and National Institute of Health officials waged a concerted campaign to obtain funding from the alcohol industry for research that may enshrine alcohol as a part of a healthy diet. An ongoing study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of N.I.H., and funded by the alcohol industry is researching the effects of a daily drink as part of a healthy diet.CreditCreditvia Library of Congress [Update, June 15: The National Institutes of Health will shut down the study of alcohol’s effects.] [Update, May 17: The National Institutes of Health has suspended enrollment as it completes review of the study.] [Update, March 20: The National Institutes of Health will examine whether health officials violated government policy by reaching out to alcohol companies for funding to support a study of moderate drinking.] It was going to be a study that could change the American diet, a huge clinical trial that might well deliver all the medical evidence needed to recommend a daily alcoholic drink as part of a healthy lifestyle. That was how two prominent scientists and a senior federal health official pitched the project during a presentation at the luxurious Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla., in 2014. And the audience members who were being asked to help pay for the $100 million study seemed receptive: They were all liquor company executives. The 10-year government trial is now underway, and Anheuser Busch InBev, Heineken and other alcohol companies are picking up most of the tab, through donations to a private foundation that raises money for the National Institutes of Health. The N.I.H., a federal agency, is considered one of the world’s foremost medical research centers, investing over $30 billion of taxpayer money in biomedical research each year. The vast majority of the funding goes to scientists outside the N.I.H., which manages the grants and provides oversight. The alcohol study is overseen by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, one of 27 centers under the N.I.H. The lead investigator and N.I.H. officials have said repeatedly that they never discussed the planning of the study with the industry. But a different picture emerges from emails and travel vouchers obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act, as well as from interviews with former federal officials. The documents and interviews show that the institute waged a vigorous campaign to court the alcohol industry, paying for scientists to travel to meetings with executives, where they gave talks strongly suggesting that the study’s results would endorse moderate drinking as healthy. An N.I.A.A.A. official, now retired, said she followed up after the presentations with appeals for money, telling industry executives the research could not be done without their support. The meetings in late 2013 and early 2014 included a “working lunch” at the Beer Institute convention in Philadelphia, and two meetings at the Washington headquarters of the Distilled Spirits Council, a liquor industry trade group, as well as the presentation at The Breakers. Dr. Kenneth J. Mukamal, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and now the lead investigator of the study, and Dr. John Krystal, a Yale University neuroscientist, argued that a long-term randomized controlled trial could dispel lingering doubts about the benefits of moderate daily drinking. “A definitive clinical trial represents a unique opportunity to show that moderate alcohol consumption is safe and lowers risk of common diseases,” said one slide in the scientists’ presentation at The Breakers. “That level of evidence is necessary if alcohol is to be recommended as part of a healthy diet.” “We have strong reason to suspect so,” said another slide, referring to the large number of studies suggesting that moderate alcohol may be linked to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The fund-raising may have violated N.I.H. policy, which prohibits employees from soliciting or suggesting donations, funds or other resources intended to support activities. At the least, the campaign is bound to raise more questions about the independence of the investigators and the scientific integrity of the huge trial. The presentations gave the alcohol industry an opportunity to preview the trial design and vet the investigators. Indeed, the scientist leading the meetings was eventually chosen to head the huge clinical trial. They also made the industry privy to pertinent details, including a list of clinical sites and investigators who were “already on board,” the size and length of the trial, approximate number of participants, and the fact that they could choose any beverage. By design, no form of alcohol — wine, liquor or beer — would be called out as better than another in the trial. Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health who was shown slides from the scientists’ presentation at The Breakers by The Times, said the study “is not public health research — it’s marketing.” “This must have seemed like a dream come true for industry. Of course they would pay for it,” he said. “They’re admitting the trial is designed to provide a justification for moderate drinking. That’s not objective science.” Asked about the meetings, Dr. Mukamal did not deny he had participated, but said the slides did not convey the full complexity of his presentation. Last year, Dr. Mukamal told The New York Times that he had had “literally no contact with anyone in the alcohol industry in the planning of this.” He defended that statement saying the presentations took place long before the N.I.H. announced the funding grant in late 2015. The description of the trial that he gave at the meetings was just a “boilerplate,” he said. “My job there wasn’t to raise money,” Dr. Mukamal added. “It was to educate.” The N.I.H. awards most research funds on a competitive basis, and grant applications undergo a two-tier review of the scientific merit and public import of a project, as well as the scientific integrity. At a cost of $100 million, the new trial aims to resolve a persistent medical conundrum. Though excessive drinking is harmful and problem drinking is on the rise in the United States, many observational studies have found that moderate drinkers outlive abstainers and have less heart disease. These studies don’t prove that moderate drinking is the reason these people live longer, however. The new trial, called the Moderate Alcohol and Cardiovascular Health Trial (M.A.C.H.), is intended to answer that question. In January, Dr. Mukamal and his colleagues started recruiting volunteers ages 50 and older who are at high risk for heart disease; eventually there are to be 7,800 participants at 16 sites worldwide. Half will be told to abstain from alcohol. The rest, including both men and women, will be told to have one serving of alcohol a day. No other long-term trial has ever asked participants to drink, much less drink every day. Scientists will track the two groups for six years on average to see whether daily drinkers have fewer heart attacks and strokes, and lower odds of diabetes and death. The research will attempt to track the risks of drinking, but critics say it may not fully capture the harms. For one thing, the study will be too short to detect an increase in cancers linked to alcohol consumption, which may take decades to develop. In addition, two servings has long been considered moderate drinking for men. Lowering the threshold may reduce falls, car accidents and alcohol abuse among the subjects; but one drink daily also may not reflect real-life habits. Moreover, many people whose health might be compromised by light drinking — anyone with a history of addiction, psychiatric, liver or kidney problems, certain cancers or a family history of breast cancer — will not be allowed to participate. People who have never drunk alcohol also are excluded. “You’re picking off the people who are most likely to have the harms,” said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at Boston University School of Public Health, after reviewing the parameters of the study. But if the study finds even a modest cardiovascular benefit to light drinking, he added, “You can be sure that the way it will be understood by the general public is that this applies to everybody.” Despite its shortcomings, M.A.C.H. may well be the last word on the subject of moderate drinking, since trials like these are both expensive and logistically complicated to carry out. Dr. Mukamal, who has published nearly a hundred scientific papers on the relationship between moderate drinking and cardiovascular disease, emphasized in an interview that he was committed to reporting the results accurately based on the data. “If anyone has any doubt whatsoever that our intent is to provide the most accurate and precise description of our findings, they are sorely mistaken,” he said. Private contributions for the study from the alcohol industry are being channeled through the Foundation for the N.I.H., a nongovernmental entity that raises money for N.I.H. research and manages the partnerships established to direct private donations. In this case, the industry donors were expected to be held at “arm’s length” and not to play any role in the research or to communicate with the scientists, said Julie Wolf-Rodda, director of development for the foundation. George Koob, the current director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said the foundation constitutes an impregnable “firewall” that prevents donors from interfering with research. In an interview, he said he was unaware of the meetings between N.I.H. officials and industry officials to rally support for the study, most of which took place before he took the helm of the institute in late January 2014. He denied that the institute had solicited funding. Raising his voice during an interview, Dr. Koob insisted the industry’s sponsorship would not compromise the study and said that the study protocol went through several rigorous reviews. “We do things right at N.I.H.,” he said. But his predecessor, Dr. Ken Warren, who helped organize and participated in some of the meetings as acting director of the alcohol abuse institute, acknowledged in an interview that the scientists’ presentations were meant to both “demonstrate to the industry that the study was feasible” and “to determine if they had interest in taking part” as funders. Questions about moderate drinking and heart disease are important public health questions, Dr. Warren said, and a government trial would be more credible than research “directly funded by an entity such as the alcoholic beverage industry, which could be considered biased.” Most of the cost of this government trial, however, is being picked up by five of the world’s largest alcoholic beverage makers — Anheuser-Busch InBev, Heineken, Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Carlsberg. In an interview, Dr. Lorraine Gunzerath, a retired senior adviser to Dr. Warren, took credit for coming up with the idea of reaching out to the alcohol industry for funding. Clinical trials like this one don’t fall neatly under the mission of the alcohol abuse institute, she said. “We were supposed to be preventing alcoholism, so to spend that kind of money on research for a possible good use of alcohol was something that would never fly,” she said. But, referring to the alcohol industry, Dr. Gunzerath said, “If we had a clinical trial, and it was a positive result — which we thought it might be, you sort of think you know where it’s going — they’d be happy.” All the N.I.H. had to do was “make a business case to the industry that it would be to their benefit, even if they couldn’t actually control the trial’s outcome,” Dr. Gunzerath said. She arranged for the university scientists to address executives at alcohol industry meetings. “If they didn’t like the research team, they would have said no,” she said. It was no secret at the time that Dr. Mukamal and his collaborators “already believed that moderate alcohol is a good thing,” she said. He already had published papers suggesting as much. After the scientists’ presentations, which were provided to The Times by Dr. Gunzerath, she would speak briefly to say that “it would be nice if we could get money from the industry,” but explain that funds would have to flow through the foundation. On Sept. 30, 2013, Dr. Gunzerath sent an email headed “URGENT! Response needed ASAP!” to Dr. Mukamal, inviting him to Philadelphia to address the annual meeting of the Worldwide Brewing Alliance, to get the brewers’ “buy in” and “extra overall funding potential as well.” “I can make it,” Dr. Mukamal responded. “I could do any version or part or the whole day, night before or drive down that day etc. whatever works best for you.” Dr. Gunzerath and Dr. Warren also arranged meetings between the scientists and industry representatives at the Distilled Spirits Council’s Washington headquarters on Nov. 21, 2013, and Jan. 28, 2014. A spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council said that after the N.I.A.A.A. approached the trade group in 2013, the council “provided them with a forum to present the initial outline of their study.” Representatives of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Heineken and Diageo confirmed that the scientists’ presentations played a role in the companies’ decisions to underwrite the trial. “When Heineken was invited by the N.I.H. to partially fund the N.I.A.A.A. trial for a duration of ten years, as part of our decision making process, the scientists presented the research project to us so we would have a sound understanding of the trial,” Michael Fuchs, a company spokesman, said in an email. These days, it is not unusual for the N.I.H. to look to business to participate in public-private partnerships to fund medical research. When an N.I.H. center is seeking outside funding from the private sector, it starts by submitting a “request for collaboration” to a steering committee of the N.I.H. and the foundation based in the office of the director of the N.I.H., Dr. Francis Collins. For the moderate drinking trial, the alcohol abuse institute signed an agreement with the foundation that said, “Under no circumstances shall N.I.A.A.A. or its representatives communicate directly with any Donor in order to raise funds for the project or to disclose to any Donor any information” about “the name and affiliation of the awardee” or “details and information relevant to the award.” But by the time the institute submitted the request for outside funding in early 2015, its officials and outside scientists had already met with alcohol industry executives. Representatives of beer and liquor companies had already heard directly from Dr. Mukamal. The alcohol abuse institute took an extra step to secure Dr. Mukamal’s position as top contender for the grant. While N.I.H. grants are supposed to be awarded on a competitive basis, the institute’s request for outside funding said the award would be restricted to applicants with “unique” resources and backgrounds — and specifically mentioned Dr. Mukamal, who had helped persuade the alcohol industry to fund the research. Whether scientists studying alcohol should accept money from the industry has long been controversial. Many scientists and policymakers have publicly said that any engagement with the alcohol industry undermines the credibility of the research. In 2016, a group representing hundreds of scientists and policymakers published a statement saying researchers should never accept direct or indirect industry funding, and that “any form of engagement with the alcohol industry may influence the independence, objectivity, integrity and credibility” of the research. “We know that industry funding not only affects the results of studies but affects the questions that are asked, how the results are analyzed and what the answers are,” said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of pharmacology at Georgetown University and director of Pharmed Out, a group that researches drug marketing. If the health effects of moderate drinking are a priority for the N.I.H., she added, “they should fund it themselves.”",The New York Times
2018,Federal Budget Bill Could Affect Minor Leaguers’ Pay,"The $1.3 trillion spending bill expected to be considered by Congress this week could have significant implications for thousands of minor league baseball players. The bill, which must be passed by March 23 in order to avoid a government shutdown, could include a provision that would codify the current de facto exemption of minor league players from federal fair labor laws. According to a report in The Washington Post, a provision that would favor M.L.B. has been raised during negotiations over the bill, which could suppress a lawsuit brought by a group of minor league players over their compensation. The potential provision, which was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the negotiations, would allow M.L.B. to continue paying minor leaguers very low salaries. Inclusion of the provision, after years of lobbying by M.L.B., could open baseball and members of Congress to criticism over a multibillion-dollar entity using its influence in Washington to exploit some of its employees during a period of legislative urgency. “It just underscores the state of our country right now,” said Garrett Broshuis, a former minor league pitcher and a lawyer for the minor league players. “Major League Baseball billionaires have been lobbying Congress, and now they could attach this provision to a bill intended to avoid a government shutdown, and it’s all done in total secrecy.” Baseball considers minor league players as seasonal apprentices, similar to musicians, artists, actors and others in certain industries who accept low pay for a temporary period as they seek to break into the big time. M.L.B. sometimes pays the players, no matter which minor league team they play for, less than $1,500 per month, but only for a six-month period — less than the federal minimum wage. If the provision is not included in the final bill, which is expected to be presented this week, baseball could continue with its current pay system, at least until the litigation on behalf of minor leaguers is resolved. Baseball is not expected to make any changes while the case is still pending, as it does not want to enact unilateral pay raises until it is known how the next system would work, particularly regarding overtime. “It would be totally impractical to treat players as hourly employees,” said Daniel Halem, M.L.B.’s deputy commissioner of baseball administration. “Minor league baseball is not a career. It is intended to be an avenue to the major leagues where you either make it, or you move on to something else.” Teams also pay lucrative signing bonuses to many, though not all, minor leaguers. According to M.L.B.’s 2016 figures, about 1,850 players received bonuses of at least $50,000 (for a total of about $440 million), which are paid out over the course of two seasons. M.L.B. notes that, on average, a player who does not reach the big leagues spends only two and a half years in the minor leagues, emphasizing the temporary nature of the work. Those who do advance to the majors are rewarded handsomely with a minimum salary of $545,000 per year, and often well more than that. But life in the minors can be difficult. The players’ lawsuit, originally filed in 2014, claims that the current system is unfair to the minor leaguers, who deserve to enjoy the same protections as any hourly wage earner, including extensive overtime pay to cover long game days, extra practices and lengthy travel. The M.L.B. Players Association does not represent minor league players, so they do not have a unit to collectively bargain with M.L.B., leaving the lawsuit as their only recourse at the moment. Baseball argues that if the current litigation, which could take another year to resolve, is decided in favor of the plaintiffs, it would become too costly to support the large network of minor league teams, and many organizations would eliminate teams at the lower levels. Broshuis, who spent six years in the San Francisco Giants organization, asserted that baseball has more than enough money to pay for all the minor league teams with a fraction of its overall revenue. He added that, with a wide range of age and talent among players spread throughout the system, major league teams were aware they needed to maintain enough minor league layers to accommodate them appropriately. Baseball’s current agreement with Minor League Baseball runs until 2020. Under the current system, the major league teams pay the salaries of the players and coaches and the minor league teams pay the major league teams $20 million and a portion of ticket sales. It is a nominal fee, and Major League organizations lose money in the minor leagues, but it still serves as a relatively cheap, if inefficient, method of player development. “Baseball is a $10 billion industry,” Broshuis said. “There is more money than ever before. But for several decades they have neglected to give their players a raise, and they need to do so.”",The New York Times

2018,"Opinion | Fifteen Years Ago, America Destroyed My Country","Op-Ed Contributor When I was 12, Saddam Hussein, vice president of Iraq at the time, carried out a huge purge and officially usurped total power. I was living in Baghdad then, and I developed an intuitive, visceral hatred of the dictator early on. That feeling only intensified and matured as I did. In the late 1990s, I wrote my first novel, “I’jaam: An Iraqi Rhapsody,” about daily life under Saddam’s authoritarian regime. Furat, the narrator, was a young college student studying English literature at Baghdad University, as I had. He ends up in prison for cracking a joke about the dictator. Furat hallucinates and imagines Saddam’s fall, just as I often did. I hoped I would witness that moment, whether in Iraq or from afar. I left Iraq a few months after the 1991 Gulf War and went to graduate school in the United States, where I’ve been ever since. In 2002, when the cheerleading for the Iraq war started, I was vehemently against the proposed invasion. The United States had consistently supported dictators in the Arab world and was not in the business of exporting democracy, irrespective of the Bush administration’s slogans. I recalled sitting in my family’s living room with my aunt when I was a teenager, watching Iraqi television and seeing Donald Rumsfeld visiting Baghdad as an emissary from Ronald Reagan and shaking hands with Saddam. That memory made Mr. Rumsfeld’s words in 2002 about freedom and democracy for Iraqis seem hollow. Moreover, having lived through two previous wars (the Iran-Iraq war of 1980 to 1988 and the Gulf War of 1991), I knew that the actual objectives of war were always camouflaged by well-designed lies that exploit collective fear and perpetuate national myths. I was one of about 500 Iraqis in the diaspora — of various ethnic and political backgrounds, many of whom were dissidents and victims of Saddam’s regime — who signed a petition: “No to war on Iraq. No to dictatorship.” While condemning Saddam’s reign of terror, we were against a “war that would cause more death and suffering” for innocent Iraqis and one that threatened to push the entire region into violent chaos. Our voices were not welcomed in mainstream media in the United States, which preferred the pro-war Iraqi-American who promised cheering crowds that would welcome invaders with “sweets and flowers.” There were none. The petition didn’t make much of an impact. Fifteen years ago today, the invasion of Iraq began. Three months later, I returned to Iraq for the first time since 1991 as part of a collective to film a documentary about Iraqis in a post-Saddam Iraq. We wanted to show my countrymen as three-dimensional beings, beyond the binary of Saddam versus the United States. In American media, Iraqis had been reduced to either victims of Saddam who longed for occupation or supporters and defenders of dictatorship who opposed the war. We wanted Iraqis to speak for themselves. For two weeks, we drove around Baghdad and spoke to many of its residents. Some were still hopeful, despite being drained by years of sanctions and dictatorship. But many were furious and worried about what was to come. The signs were already there: the typical arrogance and violence of a colonial occupying power. My short visit only confirmed my conviction and fear that the invasion would spell disaster for Iraqis. Removing Saddam was just a byproduct of another objective: dismantling the Iraqi state and its institutions. That state was replaced with a dysfunctional and corrupt semi-state. We were still filming in Baghdad when L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, announced the formation of the so-called Governing Council in July 2003. The names of its members were each followed by their sect and ethnicity. Many of the Iraqis we spoke to on that day were upset with institutionalization of an ethno-sectarian quota system. Ethnic and sectarian tensions already existed, but their translation into political currency was toxic. Those unsavory characters on the governing council, most of whom were allies of the United States from the preceding decade, went on to loot the country, making it one of the most corrupt in the world. We were fortunate to have been able to shoot our film in that brief period during which there was relative public security. Shortly after our visit, Iraq descended into violence; suicide bombings became the norm. The invasion made my country a magnet for terrorists (“We’ll fight them there so we don’t have to fight them here,” President George W. Bush had said), and Iraq later descended into a sectarian civil war that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands more, irrevocably changing the country’s demography. The next time I returned to Baghdad was in 2013. The American tanks were gone, but the effects of the occupation were everywhere. I had low expectations, but I was still disheartened by the ugliness of the city where I had grown up and horrified by how dysfunctional, difficult and dangerous daily life had become for the great majority of Iraqis. My last visit was in April 2017. I flew from New York, where I now live, to Kuwait, where I was giving a lecture. An Iraqi friend and I crossed the border by land. I was going to the city of Basra, in the south of Iraq. Basra was the only major Iraqi city I had not visited before. I was going to sign my books at the Friday book market of al-Farahidi Street, a weekly gathering for bibliophiles modeled after the famous Mutanabbi Street book market in Baghdad. I was driven around by friends. I didn’t expect the beautiful Basra I’d seen on 1970s postcards. That city had long disappeared. But the Basra I saw was so exhausted and polluted. The city had suffered a great deal during the Iran-Iraq war, and its decline accelerated after 2003. Basra was pale, dilapidated and chaotic thanks to the rampant corruption. Its rivers are polluted and ebbing. Nonetheless, I made a pilgrimage to the famous statue of Iraq’s greatest poet, Badr Shakir al-Sayyab. One of the few sources of joy for me during these short visits were the encounters with Iraqis who had read my novels and were moved by them. These were novels I had written from afar, and through them, I tried to grapple with the painful disintegration of an entire country and the destruction of its social fabric. These texts are haunted by the ghosts of the dead, just as their author is. No one knows for certain how many Iraqis have died as a result of the invasion 15 years ago. Some credible estimates put the number at more than one million. You can read that sentence again. The invasion of Iraq is often spoken of in the United States as a “blunder,” or even a “colossal mistake.” It was a crime. Those who perpetrated it are still at large. Some of them have even been rehabilitated thanks to the horrors of Trumpism and a mostly amnesiac citizenry. (A year ago, I watched Mr. Bush on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” dancing and talking about his paintings.) The pundits and “experts” who sold us the war still go on doing what they do. I never thought that Iraq could ever be worse than it was during Saddam’s reign, but that is what America’s war achieved and bequeathed to Iraqis. OpinionWilliam Ruger",The New York Times
2018,Fight to Control Office That Roots Out Corruption in New York Schools,"The selection of a new chancellor has dominated education circles in New York City for the last few weeks, but behind the scenes a more prosaic bureaucratic drama was playing out over control of the office that investigates corruption in the 1.1 million-student school system. It was a municipal scuffle: The commissioner of the city Department of Investigation tried to seize total control of the semiautonomous office that polices corruption in the school system. The Department of Education has since pushed back — hard. The move by the investigation commissioner, Mark G. Peters, resulted in an unusual legal skirmish between the two agencies, pitting an archaic set of municipal records against a series of new documents drawn up by the investigation department. On one side was a series of mayoral executive orders, the earliest dating back to 1990, and two Board of Education resolutions of similar vintage, which give the office its authority. On the other was paperwork prepared by Mr. Peters’ staff that would have given him full control. The outgoing schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, has refused to sign it. The office, known as the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the New York City School District, investigates allegations of corruption, criminal activity, conflicts of interest and unethical conduct in the system, the largest in the country. The education department’s position on the dispute — and on the actions of Mr. Peters — was unequivocal. “The authority of the special commissioner for D.O.E. arises from the current executive order,” Toya Holness, the education department’s press secretary, said in a statement. “That authority cannot be altered unilaterally by the D.O.I. commissioner. We are aware of no reason why that authority should be changed.” In an interview in his office on Monday, Mr. Peters said repeatedly that he has the authority to make the changes he has undertaken without the legal documents prepared by his staff, despite the fact that his department had sought Ms. Farina’s signature on them in recent weeks. “I am unaware that they declined to sign it,” Mr. Peters said. “We believe we have the authority to do this.” Later in the week, however, he seemed to back down. Asked to respond to the Department of Education statement, Mr. Peters released a statement of his own through a spokeswoman, saying, “D.O.I. agrees that the authority of the special commissioner pursuant to Executive Order 11 cannot be altered by D.O.I., has not been altered by D.O.I. and need not be altered by D.O.I.” Officials in the education department and elsewhere in city government did not suggest that Mr. Peters would do a poor job in an expanded role. But several current and former officials said the way he has sought to make changes without the proper authority has raised concerns. The special commissioner has always reported to the investigation commissioner, but the office has essentially operated as an independent agency as a result of the substantial power and authority provided for in the executive order and board resolutions. It is funded by the education department. Taking direct control would give Mr. Peters the power to hire and fire, set salaries, promote and demote, discipline, and assign the duties and responsibilities of the investigators and other employees of the special commissioner’s office. One of the legal documents prepared by the Department of Investigation sought Ms. Fariña’s approval for Mr. Peters’s agency to exercise those powers, as well as the authority to assign staff “consistent with the needs of D.O.I.,” according to a copy of the document. Without her signature, those responsibilities remain with the office of the special commissioner. Mr. Peters said his actions were prompted by the retirement late last year of Special Commissioner Richard J. Condon. A widely respected former New York Police Department commissioner, Mr. Condon was appointed special commissioner in 2002 and earned the respect of many at the education and investigation departments, and elsewhere in city government. Mr. Peters has made additional unilateral changes that appear to run afoul of the orders and resolutions, and which, along with his other actions, would largely eliminate the autonomy that the office has had since it was created in 1990 and which has helped enable it to aggressively root out corruption. He has changed the title of the head of the office from special commissioner of investigation to inspector general, a less prestigious position that is equivalent to more than a dozen other investigation department officials. The old executive orders provide that the special commissioner has the authority to sign subpoenas, compel testimony and publish reports. The new inspector general, Anastasia Coleman, a former senior assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, would not have those powers, and would have to seek approval from senior officials at the department. Mr. Peters said those changes would ensure consistency and add little time to investigations. He has also done away with the special commissioner’s separate website, consolidating it with his department’s. In addition, he has changed the reporting structure. Instead of reporting directly to the investigation commissioner, Ms. Coleman will report to an assistant commissioner, who reports to a deputy commissioner, who reports to the first deputy commissioner, who reports to Mr. Peters. The changes were needed to create uniformity, Mr. Peters said, and so that his agency could take a more systemic look at the Department of Education, the way it has focused on the city’s Department of Correction and the New York City Housing Authority, where the investigation department has looked into on corruption, mismanagement and other problems. He also contended that an even older executive order, from 1978, gave him the authority to make the changes he has undertaken because the city school system is now under mayoral control. In recent weeks, the investigation agency has moved quickly to act on the new authority it has sought over the special commissioner’s office, posting a job vacancy notice for an assistant commissioner level job there, which it has attempted to fund through the education department, according to documents and emails. But the post, chief information security officer, with a salary of $120,000 to $150,000, would serve the investigation department, according to the posting, which said the job would “increase the agency’s overall security posture.” Mr. Peters said that the education department funding for the position was only temporary. Toward the end of the interview, he seemed to be loosing patience with questions about his actions in connection with the special commissioner’s office. “Either people cooperate with our investigations or they don’t,” he said. “Everything else is just noise.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Fighting Death By Gunshot,"Fixes Kenji Inaba is a trauma surgeon at Los Angeles County General Hospital and director of the surgical intensive care unit. He’s also a sworn reserve police officer, part of a two-man patrol in the Rampart Division of the Los Angeles Police Department. Between policing and doing emergency surgery, he gets a lot of exposure to gunshot wounds, both entry and exit — how people get shot, and how they get better. In his police car he has a bag with basic medical emergency equipment, along with something that’s not so basic — a syringe called Xstat that is full of tiny, absorbent sponges to stop the bleeding from a gunshot wound. It’s one of several new and almost-new pieces of technology that can keep a shooting from becoming a murder. We rivet our attention on guns when a mass shooting occurs. But those shootings make up only a tiny fraction of homicides. As for the rest, they are concentrated among young men of color. The gun death rate among white males is 17 per 100,000, with a vast majority suicides. For black males the numbers are 34 per 100,000, with a vast majority homicides. For black males between 20 and 29, the rate is 89 per 100,000. Many grand reforms could help lower those statistics by addressing policing strategies, gun policies, institutional racism, police-community relations and the economic fortunes of poor neighborhoods. But technology can also make a difference. Most gunshot victims die of blood loss. Xstat is a new product that can stop the bleeding from penetrating wounds — from guns, knives, shrapnel, whatever — that are narrow and deep. It’s especially useful for wounds in the hip or shoulder, where tourniquets cannot be applied. Xstat’s sponges instantly absorb the blood and expand to put pressure on the wound. They’re physically tagged with a marker that will show up on an X-ray so that doctors can check that they were all removed. Xstat was designed for and first used by the military. Will Fox, a spokesman for RevMedx, the company that makes Xstat, said that all United States Army Special Forces and Ranger medics carry two types of syringes — a fat tube version designed for exit wounds from high-velocity automatic weapons and a thin tube version, which works for entrance and other small wounds and is more appropriate for civilian use. RevMedx is also working on a version for postpartum hemorrhage, the leading cause of maternal deaths. Fox said that medical personnel in about 15 cities carry Xstat in their ambulances or employ it in trauma centers. Inaba, who has yet another job, as vice chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Southern California, is doing the first study of its use on civilians. (He has no ties to RevMedx.) He hasn’t used Xstat yet while out on patrol — he hasn’t seen appropriate wounds — but he and his team have used it 14 times in the hospital. “It works, Inaba said. “It’s a simple mechanical device. We’re very selective about who’s gotten it, and it stops the bleeding. It fills a relatively specific niche where there isn’t a good alternative right now.” Xstat has drawbacks as well. “You have to pick all the pieces out, and you never know how many there are,” Inaba said. “So everyone has to have an X-ray. And in 20 to 30 percent of cases, you can expect to see a sponge retained. And then there’s one more X-ray.” Another issue is price. A tourniquet costs $27 and can be used repeatedly. Fox said the price of the small Xstat is now $80, down from $120 — and it’s not reusable. “They’re going to have to drop their costs in order for it to be appropriately used,” Inaba said. “To equip every single ambulance with something that sits on the shelf in the vast majority of cases, that’s a huge cost outlay. I think that’s excessive.” Xstat is one of several innovative products that stop bleeding. The British company Celox Medical makes granules and gauzes impregnated with chitosan, made from shells of shrimp and crabs. They form an effective emergency plug when packed or poured into a wound. They can be used for more kinds of wounds, on more places on the body, than Xstat. But they take longer to stop bleeding, the powder is hard to use anywhere there’s wind, and they aren’t good for treating gunshot wounds that spurt blood from a nicked artery or vein — a task Xstat can do. Speed matters for gunshot wounds. A slow response can mean not only that victims die, but also that evidence and eyewitnesses melt away. That is a problem. In a large majority of cases, the police never find out about shootings; researchers looking at Oakland, Calif., and Washington found that only one in eight gunshot incidents are reported. (Homicides are well reported, but fortunately, 99 percent of shootings don’t kill anyone.) When people do make a call, it can be after precious minutes are lost to debate about whether what they heard was a gunshot. And callers often can give the police only the vaguest description of the direction the gunshot noise came from. So the police drive around the area. If they find nothing suspicious, they might sit in their car with the lights out for a while to see if anything happens. If they do happen upon a crime scene, of course, they will be going in blind, which is always dangerous. What could help is technology that instantly reports gunshots and their location. In fact, it already exists and is provided by a company called ShotSpotter. More than 85 American cities and Cape Town, South Africa, use it — some across the entire city, many just in high-crime areas. New York City has 57 square miles covered by ShotSpotter. Cities lease the technology and services, and the company puts up acoustic sensors on buildings and lampposts. They can pinpoint the location of a shot by how fast the sound reaches different sensors. Machine algorithms and then a panel of human acoustics analysts sitting in California look at the sound patterns and determine whether it’s gunfire — and if so, how many shots and whether automatic weapons are involved. The police get the audio file and location, to within 27 yards, on their cellphones or car computers within 45 seconds of a shot. “Before it was ‘my best guess is down the block somewhere,’” said Brian Foley, the deputy police chief of Hartford. “ShotSpotter puts us within meters and sometimes within the foot, and it does not sleep. It’s a much more accurate picture.” ShotSpotter has critics. It is expensive — $65,000 to $85,000 per square mile of coverage. (Some cities get Justice Department or other federal grants to pay for it.) Before 2011, computers made the determinations alone, and often mislabeled other noises as gunshots. But since humans entered the process, it has become much more accurate. It’s easy to see how ShotSpotter could save victims by providing paramedics with faster and more accurate location reports. But how — and even whether — ShotSpotter also reduces shootings hasn’t been proved. “There haven’t been any rigorous studies of the impact of ShotSpotter,” said Jennifer Doleac, an assistant professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia. One reason is the company goes to extraordinary lengths to keep cities from releasing their ShotSpotter data. Some cities have seen large decreases in shootings after using it, but they are often making other changes as well, and it’s hard to say what role ShotSpotter played. The company points out that since 2011, about 10 times more cities have expanded their ShotSpotter coverage than have ended it. One way the technology could reduce crime is by giving police accurate data. If a police department knows the number, location and time of shootings, it can test crime-control measures: Did the night basketball program reduce shootings? Also, the police can focus their resources: Once it’s known that a particular corner has lots of gunfire at midnight on Fridays, they can better patrol it. Hartford is planning to send not just police officers and paramedics to the scenes of shootings but — as soon as the area is secure — therapists as well, to work with children who heard or saw the shooting. “It tells us where we need to patrol,” Deputy Chief Foley said. “But it’s also going to tell us where the most traumatized neighborhoods are — the kids most likely to have mental health concerns down the road, and most likely to be in the criminal justice system.” Having the audio file and an exact location also tells the police more about what they’re walking into, which keeps them safer. Foley believes that ShotSpotter has helped Hartford’s police to solve crimes; the clearance rate has jumped to 65 or 70 percent from 35 to 40 percent, he said. “We’ve done more than use the tech, but it’s absolutely helped,” he said. ShotSpotter’s audio files are admissible in court. If a city has video cameras, the sensors can activate and point them. The location accuracy allows the police to get out of their car and look at a small area. That way they have a better chance of finding shell casings, which can tie the shooting to a specific gun. The police can arrive while witnesses are there, and they can interview witnesses differently. Instead of asking “What happened?” they can say: “There were three shots right across the street. What did you see?” The technology can also strengthen the relationship between the police and the community. All those unreported shootings? Local people don’t know they’re unreported. They will just assume that the police didn’t show because they didn’t care. And that helps to normalize gunfire. “That has all kinds of bad consequences,” said Ralph Clark, ShotSpotter’s chief executive. Clark grew up in a high-crime area of Oakland but now lives in a safer neighborhood. “If someone fires a gun in the place in Oakland I live now, I definitely expect the police to show up,” he said. “They knock on doors to make sure people are O.K. That’s exactly the same way they should respond in the community I grew up in.”",The New York Times
2018,Fighting Disease Is a Battle Often Won With Spreadsheets,"Vocations Christina Tan, 48, is the state epidemiologist at the New Jersey Department of Health in Trenton. What is your role in protecting people’s health? The main function is to track and monitor both common and unusual diseases in the state, and characterize their distribution. We provide our data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so they can compile national pictures of disease trends and problems, whether from infectious diseases or cancer. We also work to prevent recurrences. What’s your background? I’m a doctor of internal medicine and also completed a fellowship related to my current position. During medical school at what is now the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, I took an elective in which I shadowed the C.D.C.’s Epidemic Intelligence Service officers in Atlanta, which was my introduction to this field. After my residency, I applied for the fellowship with the Epidemic Intelligence Service and was assigned to the New Jersey Department of Health from 2000 to 2002. It was an exciting time, because the state was ground zero for the anthrax attacks that followed Sept. 11. Had you originally thought you’d work in a hospital or private practice? Yes. My father was a gastroenterologist, so between his practice and my medical training, I was only familiar with physicians who worked in clinical practice, did research or trained other physicians. But during my residency at what is now NYU Langone Health, I started to have doubts. The high volume of patients was exhausting, and the fellowship offered an opportunity to think about whether being a clinician was the right fit. The officers I’d shadowed during medical school went out into the field to the site of an outbreak, such as a cruise ship, and did what we called shoe leather epidemiology, pounding the pavement. What else attracted you to this role? My predecessor was my supervisor during my fellowship. One minute he was serving as a health expert, and the next he was communicating health risks. Following that, he was responding to a public health emergency or figuring out how to get resources for programs. He had to work with a variety of groups and make decisions really quickly, often with little information. It was a cool thing to watch and confirmed my interest in this area. What lessons are there from flu season? Fortunately, the season has peaked, but we’re still seeing widespread flu activity that will most likely last through May. The flu is unpredictable, which is why public health departments monitor it all year round. For example, we saw the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the late spring, after seasonal flu ended that year. We’ve learned that we need to ensure that public health and health care partners maintain vigilance in monitoring for flu and other emerging infections. We also need to maintain flexibility in our preparedness and response plans so we can adapt what we do, based on what the disease trends tell us. Do you get out in the field these days? Yes, but my team mainly plugs away at spreadsheets, looking at data. Most outbreak investigations are not glamorous or hyper-dramatic, like in the movie Contagion. I’m also the assistant commissioner of the state Epidemiology, Environmental and Occupational Health division. We often work with local health departments and health care facilities that are in the field interviewing patients and collecting specimens, including blood, sputum and stool, for lab testing, to confirm the presence of certain microorganisms. Occasionally — particularly with some of the rarer diseases like imported Lassa fever — we’ll work in the field to further monitor hospital staff members that have been exposed, or to interview additional patients.",The New York Times
2018,"Fighting Poverty, Drugs and Even Violence, All on a Teacher’s Salary","Raucous cheers echoed off the high marble ceilings of the West Virginia Capitol on Tuesday as state leaders announced they had met striking teachers’ demands for a 5 percent pay raise. “Who made history?” chanted the throng of red-clad teachers, who had defied state officials and, at times, even their own union leaders, by staging a nearly two-week walkout. “We made history!” The strike indeed takes a place in history, and not just for the result. Since the earliest days of teacher organizing more than a century ago, almost every moment of teacher activism has come during times of social upheaval. In 1897, the modern teachers’ union movement was born in Chicago, where teachers presided over classrooms of up to 60 children, many of whom could not speak English, in a city surging with immigrants and struggling to control rampant child labor and typhoid in the water. All for the equivalent of $13,000 a year in today’s dollars. Later strikes came during struggles over racial inequality and the future of public school teaching itself. And as classrooms light up again across West Virginia this week, teachers will be resuming their daily struggles against two modern ills: an intractable drug crisis on top of a growing nationwide fear of bloodshed in the classroom. “The work is all-encompassing,” said Karla Hilliard, a high school English teacher in Martinsburg, W.Va., and one of roughly 20,000 teachers who participated in the statewide strike. “In West Virginia we deal with high levels of poverty and the opioid epidemic,” she said, “but then there are the smaller things, like kids who come in and they don’t have support at home and they just need someone to care about them and love them.” The strike began in protest of a plan to give teachers a 2 percent raise this July and 1 percent in each of the next two years, after years of stagnating pay and rising health insurance costs. Last week, after Gov. James C. Justice, a Republican, announced a plan to increase pay by 5 percent, union leaders said classes would resume. But teachers refused, demanding that the Legislature vote to make the raise official. That finally happened on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear where the money would come from, but the governor promised there would not be cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the poor. Teachers in the state last year earned an average of about $46,000, $13,000 less than the national average. In only three states did teachers earn less: Mississippi, South Dakota and Oklahoma. In the last week, 40,000 people have joined a Facebook group calling for a walkout of Oklahoma teachers. But some West Virginia lawmakers expressed concern about the cost of the raises. While its cost of living is in the middle of the pack, the state is poor: Its median household income of $43,385, according to Census Bureau estimates from 2016, placed it 49th in the nation, ahead of only Mississippi. West Virginia has the nation’s fourth-highest unemployment rate and an opioid overdose death rate that is more than three times the national average. All of this plays out in the classroom. “I can’t tell you how many students we have being raised by grandparents because of parents’ drug addictions,” said Jay O’Neal, a seventh-grade English teacher and a leader of the strike. “It’s just part of a broader problem teaching here, dealing with the effects of poverty.” At Mr. O’Neal’s school, Stonewall Jackson Middle School in Charleston, teachers use their own money to stock a closet for students whose clothes are dirty or do not fit, or who come in wearing shorts when it is freezing outside. At faculty meetings each year, they draw some children’s names off an “angel tree” and provide them with Christmas gifts, because otherwise they would not get any. Recently, Mr. O’Neal said, teachers have noticed that some students with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., have been coming to school unmedicated and disrupting an entire class; the teachers suspect parents are selling their children’s medications. Since the mid-19th century, it has generally been the women who have been expected to do this kind of difficult, nurturing work. That gender divide played a big role in early teacher activism. Today, about 75 percent of teachers in West Virginia and across the United States are female. When teachers first unionized in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century, 97 percent were women, and they were paid little more than maids. Policymakers did not see that as a problem. Instead, they wanted to devote their extra funds to recruiting male teachers, who they thought would be tougher, and thus better able to control those huge, 60-student classes. The female teachers got angry, launched their federation, and within several years had secured a raise. They shocked the nation’s elite by marching, in petticoats, alongside Teamsters and other male unionists. Margaret Haley, a founder of the Chicago Teachers Federation, was inspired by Susan B. Anthony and other suffragists, just as today, some West Virginia teachers have come to activism through the 2017 Women’s March, the #MeToo movement or Black Lives Matter. The politics of teacher strikes shift over time, but in every generation, their leaders have forged ties to broader social movements. Many of the union leaders who led the nation’s most famous — or infamous — teacher strike, in New York City in 1968, were first active in the civil rights movement, including the 1963 March on Washington and Freedom Summer in 1964. Nevertheless, when black and Latino activists pushed for community and parent control of struggling schools, including the right to remove teachers, the union went on strike to protect teachers’ tenure rights. The seven-day teacher strike in Chicago in 2012 came a year after Occupy Wall Street, and rode a wave of dissatisfaction with elite influence in public education. Teachers won a raise and successfully pushed back against Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s desire to evaluate teachers based on their students’ test scores. Today in West Virginia, policymakers have their own ideas about how to improve schools. The State Department of Education has revamped vocational education, while the Republican-controlled Legislature has debated weakening teachers’ seniority protections and providing parents with tax incentives to pay for private school tuition. But the striking teachers asked that the State Legislature first consider the basics: the salaries and benefits that they say would keep them from fleeing the state. Terry Moe, a Stanford political scientist and often a critic of teachers’ unions, said on Monday that West Virginia teachers were not asking for anything radical. “A 5 percent raise is not much,” he said. “There’s a good case to be made that West Virginia ought to put more priority on education, and they’re not.” President Trump has suggested one way teachers could earn more — by agreeing to become armed, in order to protect students from school shootings, like the one that killed 17 people in Parkland, Fla., last month. Ms. Hilliard’s school, Spring Mills High School, has had drills and lockdowns to prepare faculty and students for threats such as a potential school gunman. Recently the school ran a “code red” drill that she thought was real, because teachers were not warned in advance. “It was nothing short of terrifying,” she said. “Our job descriptions are expanding,” said Ms. Hilliard, who opposes the idea of arming teachers, which West Virginia currently does not allow. “It becomes ‘Lay down your life if you have to.’” OpinionSarah Jaffe OpinionMichelle Goldberg",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Fights Worth Having,"Bret Stephens For my money, the best op-ed published in The Times this week was Mona Charen’s Feb. 25 barn-burner, “I’m Glad I Got Booed at CPAC.” Charen is a movement conservative who worked for Nancy and Ronald Reagan and is a longtime contributor to National Review. One of her books is titled “Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help.” A Bernie Sanders progressive she is not. But Charen is also a NeverTrumper who chose to speak her mind during a panel discussion on the #MeToo movement at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference. Asked by the moderator to discuss feminist hypocrisy, Charen reframed the question. “I’m disappointed in people on our side,” she replied. “For being hypocrites about sexual harassers and abusers of women who are in our party. Who are sitting in the White House. Who brag about their extramarital affairs. Who brag about mistreating women. And because he happens to have an ‘R’ after his name, we look the other way, we don’t complain.” She wasn’t done. She slammed the Republican Party for endorsing Roy Moore. She said it was “a disgrace” that CPAC invited the National Front scion Marion Maréchal-Le Pen to speak. She was jeered. She was accused of “virtue signaling.” She had to leave the building under escort. And she showed it was still possible to disdain partisan fashion, look a wretched thing in the eye, and say: Not I. Not this. Not ever. Not for nothing did a fellow panelist approach her after it was all over to say, “That was so brave.” Liberals tend to admire NeverTrumpers, because they see them as conservatives with a moral sense and, perhaps, a brain. By contrast, MAGA Republicans — whether of the fully or merely semi-Trumpified varieties — detest NeverTrumpers with an animus they can scarcely extend to liberals or progressives. Reacting to Charen’s CPAC appearance, one right-wing writer for Red State called her “a new voice in the wilderness of insignificance” — and then devoted 1,000 words to underscoring that insignificance. This is not, at root, ideological critique. It’s the sign of a bad conscience. The 2016 primaries showed that NeverTrumpers were never much of a political force in the G.O.P. They are even less so today, when the president has an 85 percent approval rating among Republicans. What few NeverTrumpers remain in the party’s senior ranks are either leaving politics or leaving the earthly estate. But as even minimally sentient Trumpified Republicans know, what Charen said at CPAC was true. NeverTrumpers haunt the conservative movement the way Polish or Czech dissident intellectuals such as Czeslaw Milosz and Vaclav Havel haunted that segment of Central European intelligentsia that made its peace with Stalinism after World War II. The Trumpers (and Stalinists) traded conscience for power; the NeverTrumpers and dissidents chose the reverse. Conscience can be made to suffer, but in the end it usually wins. That’s why NeverTrumpers matter; why the Trumpers know they matter (which they prove every time they feverishly assert the opposite); and why progressives who dismiss NeverTrumpers as politically irrelevant are wrong. The United States is going to have a right-of-center party in one form or another, and it matters a great deal whether that party is liberal or illiberal, capable or incapable of shame. Credible conservatives like Charen can still make a positive difference in that respect, in a way that people like, say, Elizabeth Warren cannot. That’s why you want good guys on the other side of the partisan divide, no matter how irrelevant they currently appear to be. When Trumpism fails, as it inevitably will, who will be the Republican Adenauer? I write this as a parallel contest is taking shape within the Democratic Party, most visibly in the rift between traditional liberals and the social-justice warriors of what used to be the far left. Dianne Feinstein’s failure this week to claim her party’s nomination for the Senate seat she’s held since 1992 is another depressing indication that the rift is widening. One side believes in the power of reason, the possibility of persuasion, and the values of the Enlightenment. It champions social solidarity for the sake of empowering the individual, rather than creating a society of conformists. It doesn’t see compromise as a dirty word. Its belief in the benefits of civility and diversity does not override its commitment to free speech and independent thought. As for the other side, it thinks it knows what’s True. It considers compromise knavish. It views debate — beyond its own tightly set parameters — as either pointless or dangerous. And while it sees itself as the antithesis of Trumpism, it is, in its raging intolerance and smug self-satisfaction, Trumpism’s mirror image. My advice to traditional liberals is not to repeat the establishment Republican mistake of not taking the threat of populist illiberalism seriously, and of not fighting it fiercely. The fabric of an open society is more frayed than most people realize, and it is coming unraveled from more than one end. What happened to the G.O.P. in 2016 could happen to the Democrats in 2020. The good news, as Charen courageously reminded us, is that these fights should never be abandoned even when they seem lost, and that sometimes the fights most worth having are those with our own side. William F. Buckley and Daniel Patrick Moynihan would have told you the same thing.",The New York Times
2018,Filipino Food Finds a Place in the American Mainstream,"In 1883, José Rizal, the future hero and martyr of the Philippine Revolution, was a homesick medical student abroad in Madrid. His longing for bagoong, a paste of seafood salted and left to ferment until it exudes a fathomless funk, grew so great that his worried family in Manila dispatched a jar. But it broke on the ship, releasing its pungent scent and, reportedly, terrifying the passengers. Today, bagoong and other Filipino foods are finally entering the American mainstream, more than a century after the United States Navy sailed into Manila Bay, sank the Spanish Armada and took control of the archipelago, a restive colony of around 7,100 islands and 180 languages. Americans of Filipino heritage now make up one in five of all Asian-Americans, second only to Chinese in number, and the largest percentage of immigrants serving in the United States military were born in the Philippines. Other Asian cuisines have been part of the American landscape for decades. But only in recent years have Filipino dishes started gaining recognition outside immigrant communities, at restaurants like Maharlika in New York; Bad Saint in Washington, D.C.; and Lasa in Los Angeles. The flavors of Filipino cooking, like Rizal’s broken jar of bagoong, still have the power to startle those unfamiliar with them. Although Filipino food draws on early encounters with Malay, Chinese and Arab traders as well as centuries of Spanish occupation, its profile is distinct: salty and sour above all, with less of the mitigating sweetness and chile-stoked fire found in the cooking of its Southeast Asian neighbors. Bagoong — ranging from muddy brown to plumeria pink in color, commonly made of tiny krill, anchovies or bonnetmouths — brings to soups and stews a depth of flavor that evokes cheese interred in caves and aged steak, with an extra dimension of ocean floor. It also may be eaten straight, daubed on rice or anointing slices of green mango. Along with its byproduct, patis (fish sauce), it’s an essential seasoning that claims a place on the table next to suka (vinegar) and banana ketchup (bananas cooked down in vinegar and tomato paste), as much a condiment as an ingredient. As such, it’s part of what the Manila-born food historian Doreen Fernandez termed a “galaxy of flavor-adjusters” that define how Filipinos eat: seasonings added to dishes after they’re served, in trickles and pinches, according to each diner’s taste. A chef feeding Filipinos must sublimate ego and accept that no dish emerges from the kitchen fully finished. A meal is a joint effort between cooks and eaters. IF BAGOONG IS THE SALT, suka is the sour lifeblood of the cuisine. Extracted from sugar cane or the sap from coconut trees or nipa palms, it was originally a necessary preservative in a warm climate. How to take the bounty of fish from the surrounding seas and make it last? Cure it in suka and it becomes kinilaw, an ancient recipe that may have been one of the earliest forms of ceviche. To this might be added the bite of ginger, the silkiness of coconut milk, or a sunny kiss of calamansi, which has a sharper sting than lime. For another staple, daing na bangus, milkfish is relieved of its bones, splayed and soaked in vinegar overnight for tenderness, then crisped in a pan. You can eat the flesh with a spoon. Lumpia, cousins to Chinese spring rolls, are dunked in sawsawan (dipping sauce), which may be as straightforward as vinegar with a stutter of raw garlic. The rolls come fried to a crackle or “fresh,” with uncooked, doughy skins that suggest crepes, and filled with anything from ground meat to hearts of palm to whole green finger chiles, a variation called, rightly, dynamite. Vinegar is the undertow, too, in adobo, perhaps the best known of Filipino dishes, whose ingredients and method predate its Spanish name. (“It’s really ours,” said Romy Dorotan, the chef of Purple Yam in Brooklyn.) At its base, adobo is a long braise of meat in vinegar and garlic, but other ingredients are up for debate: Some swear by soy sauce while others dismiss it as an import; some stir in achuete oil (made from annatto seeds), coconut milk, sugar or squid ink. Of all Filipino dishes, adobo “has the most leeway for a cook’s imagination, hubris, art or bigoted sense of one’s own mother’s love-and-greatness,” the novelist Gina Apostol said. There are nearly as many manifestations of adobo as there are Filipinos. But is adobo the dish that speaks most directly to the Filipino soul? Ms. Fernandez argued otherwise, in favor of sinigang, a soup she described as “the dish most representative of Filipino taste,” in part because it’s adaptable “to all classes and budgets.” Recipes differ, but the goal is the same: a sourness so profound that the first sip should make you shudder. “Sinigang is what my mother would make for me when I was sick,” said Alexandra Cuerdo, the director of the documentary “Ulam: Main Dish,” about the rise of Filipino food in America, which is set to premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival next month. The souring agent in sinigang changes by the map: It might be tamarind, guava, alibangbang leaves, kamias (the fruit of the sorrel tree), batuan (kin to mangosteen) or unripe pineapple — whatever is on hand in the region. Place matters to Filipinos, who often have tangled roots as a result of internal migration and speak multiple languages. At Lasa, the chef Chad Valencia uses rhubarb for sinigang when it’s in season. “Our region is Los Angeles,” he said. STILL, NO ONE DISH can sum up the Filipino palate. “A feast of different flavors is optimal,” said Nicole Ponseca, who runs Maharlika and Jeepney in New York. “Sauces meld, complement, make whole.” To balance the sourness of adobo and sinigang, she suggests kare-kare, a nutty-sweet stew of oxtail, bok choy, string beans and eggplant, traditionally simmered with ground peanuts and achuete oil; peanut butter, a modern substitute, lends voluptuousness. The history of kare-kare is often traced to a 20-month interregnum in the 18th century when the British wrested Manila from the Spanish. Indian cooks attending the Royal Navy brought the name and notion of curry to the islands, and had to make do with local spices. Kare-kare, sinigang and adobo are likely to appear on most Filipino menus in the United States, from turo-turo (point-point) steam-table joints to sophisticated restaurants. So, too, is dinuguan, a pork-blood stew that can pose a challenge even for Filipinos. “When I was growing up, dinuguan was a kind of culinary boogeyman, a dish that adults would tell gory stories about to scare children,” said Genevieve Villamora, one of the owners of Bad Saint. The opaque stew, classically loaded with offal, is often passed off by Filipino immigrant parents as “chocolate meat” to their suspicious children. King Phojanakong, the chef of Kuma Inn in New York, remembers wondering, “Why was it so dark?” But the mineral-rich blood is what gives the stew its ballast and faintly metallic hint of a licked knife. It must be cooked carefully so that the blood doesn’t congeal; done right, it turns to velvet. At Bad Saint, dinuguan has become one of the best-selling dishes, without the veil of euphemism. IF COOKING IS A VEHICLE for memory, for many Filipinos the dishes of their heritage are inseparable from days of celebration. “Food marks the occasion,” said Angela Dimayuga, who grew up in the Bay Area and was most recently the chef of Mission Chinese Food in New York. It’s considered particularly lucky to eat pancit (noodles) on birthdays, their uncut strands promising long life. The name of the noodles is derived from a Hokkien phrase for “fast food.” Like their Chinese antecedents, they come in different shapes and textures: miki (made with egg), bihon (rice), sotanghon (mung bean) and canton (wheat). Recipes might include sluices of soy sauce and calamansi and toppings of shrimp heads, quail eggs, shucked oysters or chicharron. For the highest occasion — like Ms. Dimayuga’s grandmother’s 99th birthday last year — there can be only one centerpiece: lechon, whole roasted pig, its shining, lacquer-thin skin primed to shatter. “It’s trendy here to go head to tail, but there it’s just a way of life,” Mr. Phojanakong said. After a party, the lechon is broken down: “You use the head for sisig” — a sizzle of jowl and ears — “trotters for adobo, make dinuguan with blood and innards and turn leftovers into paksiw,” a vinegary stew contoured with a pâté-like liver spread. The backdrop to these dishes is always rice. Its earthy scent is the constant when you walk into a Filipino home, almost a ripening in the air. To Ms. Fernandez, rice was “the shaper of other foods,” its soothing blandness allowing other dishes to be stronger in contrast. Glutinous rice is used, too, for kakanin, a genre of snacks that includes puto, little steamed cakes of ground rice and coconut milk, often accompanying dinuguan; suman, logs of sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves; and thick, gilded rounds of bibingka, perfumed with coconut and somehow fluffy and chewy at once. Wheat, which came to the Philippines with the Spanish, also has its place in daily life. At any time of day, pan de sal, a simple bread roll, is nourishment. Isa Fabro, a pastry chef in Los Angeles, slakes hers in butter suffused with ube halaya (a jam of purple yam) and latik, a coconut-milk concentrate close in spirit to dulce de leche. Some popular desserts that have European origins are now thought of as wholly Filipino: wobbly leche flan, custard under a gooey drape of caramel; Sans Rival, a dacquoise-like palimpsest of cashews, meringue and buttercream, which the chef Nora Daza served in the 1970s at her Paris restaurant Aux Iles Philippines to the likes of Brigitte Bardot and Simone de Beauvoir; and mango royale, a crema de fruta turned icebox cake, with layers of cream and mangos teetering on overripe. Beyond these greatest hits are regional specialties, which Mr. Dorotan, a native of Bicol in southeastern Luzon, wishes would get more attention. At Purple Yam, he makes laing, taro leaves simmered in coconut milk (the trademark of Bicolano cooking) until lush. But which regional specialties does he want to see more of? He laughed. There are so many islands. “Even I do not know,” he said.

2018,Final Four Matchups: What to Expect From Michigan-Loyola and Villanova-Kansas,"TIME AND TV 6:09 p.m. Eastern, TBS WHAT TO EXPECT These teams known for their offense should probably be known for their defense. Fans have long adored Coach John Beilein’s Wolverines teams for their gorgeous sets in which the ball travels from player to player with speed and grace. They have been similarly taken by the offense of the Final Four’s most improbable contestant, Loyola-Chicago, the Missouri Valley Conference tournament champion. The Ramblers’ starting five players are generally capable of shooting from any spot on the floor. But the calling card of both teams is really the defense. No wonder one Loyola-Chicago assistant coach said Michigan’s field-goal percentage would be crucial in determining the game’s outcome. Outsiders might think that Loyola-Chicago, with its No. 11 seed, is playing with house money, or that it might not expect to defeat the third-seeded Wolverines, who won the Big Ten tournament title. They should know that is not how the Ramblers see it. “It obviously keeps the chip on our shoulder as throughout the whole process we have been the underdog every single game,” said Clayton Custer, a redshirt junior who transferred from Iowa State. But, Custer said: “We don’t think of ourselves as that much of a Cinderella because we have had such a good year this year. We have been winning games all year, so we think we belong on this stage.” TIME AND TV 8:49 p.m., TBS WHAT TO EXPECT A lot of scoring. Villanova is six 3-pointers from tying the N.C.A.A. single-season record set by Virginia Military Institute in 2007 (442), while Kansas has also broken its program record for 3-pointers made this season — by nearly 70. The spread-the-floor style of both teams should not be surprising; Kansas Coach Bill Self said he adopted Villanova’s small-ball philosophy years ago, when the Wildcats were winning with four guards on the floor. This time, it’s Kansas that starts four guards around a strong rim protector (Udoka Azubuike). The Jayhawks will rely on Azubuike (if he can stay out of foul trouble) to limit the Wildcats’ ability to penetrate and find shooters around the perimeter. Villanova has yet to face a tight game down the stretch since it beat Providence in overtime in the Big East tournament championship game. The Wildcats have won each of their four games in the N.C.A.A. tournament by double digits, and it has been their defense that is quietly dominating, holding opponents to 39.4 percent shooting in the last nine games. But Villanova has not faced a backcourt as talented as Kansas’ Devonte’ Graham and Malik Newman. The latter scored 32 points in the team’s round-of-8 win over No. 2-seeded Duke and might be the hottest shooter left in the tournament. Kansas also has some mojo in this building: It won its only national title under Self in the Alamodome in 2008.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Finally, Trump Has Something Bad to Say About Russia","Editorial The West’s response to Russian aggression has usually been too little, too late, and devoid of the one voice that really matters — President Trump’s. But at last, his administration is taking action, and Mr. Trump has spoken out, tentatively. On Thursday the Treasury Department announced it was imposing sanctions for the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 election. Officials have denounced the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain and Russia’s devastating bombing missions in Syria. While such steps are encouraging, only a more robust, unified response from the United States and its NATO allies would impede President Vladimir Putin from expanding his pattern of heinous behavior. Before leaving office, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats, seized two diplomatic properties and imposed sanctions in response to the election interference. Mr. Trump, for reasons that have never been made completely clear, has until now resisted a congressional mandate that he expand the penalties. This was despite the warnings of intelligence agencies that Russia is already trying to meddle in the 2018 election and Congress’s near unanimous passage of the law demanding more sanctions. The sanctions announced on Thursday affect five Russian organizations and 19 individuals cited for spreading disinformation and propaganda to disrupt the election. While this was Mr. Trump’s most significant anti-Russia move, these are the same entities identified by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling, in a recent indictment and only add two new senior Russian officials, with ties to military intelligence, to the list Mr. Obama sanctioned in 2016, according to Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. The penalties need to go further, subjecting Mr. Putin’s wealthy cronies and their families to sanctions like travel bans and asset freezes that would put even more pressure on the Russian leader. The administration also took the unusual step of citing the Russian government for a previously unconfirmed series of intrusions into American power plants and the computer networks that control power grids that occurred about the time of the election. Those attacks suggest Russian state-sponsored hackers have been actively mapping out Western industrial, power and nuclear facilities for eventual sabotage, experts say. While Mr. Trump said nothing on Thursday about either the sanctions or Russia’s interference in the election, he did end days of silence about the attack with a military-grade nerve agent against the former spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, despite Moscow’s denials. “It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “Something that should never ever happen. We’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.” But Mr. Trump’s comments came a full day after his United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, took the lead with a more powerful statement at the Security Council. She insisted the United States stands in “absolute solidarity” with Britain after the attack. Russia’s use of chemical weapons on the soil of another United Nations member is a “defining moment,” she said, and there is a need to “hold Russia accountable.” And the piling on didn’t stop there. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, whom Mr. Trump reportedly may fire, condemned Russia in a speech on Thursday for being “complicit in Assad’s atrocities” in Syria and conducting more than 100 bombing missions in Eastern Ghouta, as well as being “responsible” for the Skripal poisoning. All of this occurred after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans to expel 23 Russian spies and suspend high-level contact with Moscow, and also joined the United States, France and Germany in a statement denouncing Russia’s action as a clear violation of international law. But the statement said nothing about joint action, and Mrs. May’s measures either lacked details or didn’t go far enough. Mr. Putin, an authoritarian leader who is expected to be re-elected easily to another six-year term on Sunday, has paid little or no price for his aggressions, including annexing Crimea, destabilizing other parts of Ukraine and enabling President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. He won’t stop until he knows that the United States will stand up to him and work with its allies to impose stronger financial and diplomatic measures to rein him in.",The New York Times
2018,"Finally, the Fall 2018 Fashion Finale","Fashion Review PARIS — After four weeks, four countries and hundreds of shows; after protests in Italy and the Olympics and the Oscars; after the emergence of the 1980s and shirtdresses and silver foil and argyle and ponchos as the ubiquitous trends; on the eve of International Women’s Day (which is either a cosmic coincidence or fate, depending on your point of view), the fashion season finally came to end in the Lefuel courtyard of the Louvre. The internal square was built between 1854 and 1857, when it was used primarily as a passage for horses, and it had never been open to the public. But Louis Vuitton has a longstanding relationship with the museum, and it needed a big, open space for the show. So on Wednesday in the fashion world stumbled, only to discover what looked like the landing pad for a giant intergalactic spaceship at the end of the ramps that once led the animals into the stables. Now, they were a runway, down which came a parade of Starship Troopers in vestiges of the outfits of the French female bourgeoisie. There’s a metaphor in there, if anyone cares to dig it up. But though backstage the designer Nicolas Ghesquière said he and his staff had countless conversations about #MeToo, this was not really #ThatToo. At least not beyond the fact that if we learned anything from this season, and designers working at this particular time, it is that all women’s wear should be by definition about #MeToo (about empowerment and a celebration of personal agency). And it should be an underlying presumption of the form, as opposed to an overlay. 46 Photos View Slide Show › That’s why, even three months after Azzedine Alaïa’s death, the brand’s showroom was packed with retailers ordering the next collection (made by the studio from his designs). Which involved, in part, wool swing coats with collars that frame the neck like a sculpture and with elaborate scribbles of hand-appliqued leather string, like a language only the wearer could read. Plus sleeveless dresses pieced together from half-moon panels of fabric in a graduated cone, so the bodice hugged the torso and the skirt swayed just a little with the walk, engineered to harness the body’s resonance. Why the line also included a new capsule of reissued designs from the mid-‘80s and ‘90s (thick ribbed sweaters with nipped-in waists; blouson backs and matching miniskirts; malleable shearling jackets with embroideries up the sides) that wore their date on their tags, because if they didn’t, you’d never know when they were made. The whole point of this exercise remained the same: to create garments that make the wearer feel confident/stronger/better/more fully herself. That should not be a trend or response to a cultural moment. It should be a given. 49 Photos View Slide Show › So when Miuccia Prada, for example, said her Miu Miu was about sharing her ideas with others and then leaving it to them to decide what they liked and how they thought it should work, it sounded pretty good. Though the offerings that followed — stonewashed jeans and matching extra-blouson bomber jackets; mega tweeds and miniskirts; shirred metallic jacquard sheaths and rainbow leathers — largely seemed to describe a cast of stock personality types: the ‘50s bombshell, the ‘80s Wham! fan, the glass-ceiling cracker, all overlaid with a dose of 21st irony. And when Mr. Ghesquière explained his time travel (as opposed to regular travel, which has long been a Vuitton thing) by saying, “We all have the experience of having more and more information about what we believe will be our future, and more and more information about what was our past. In between those things is how we define our present,” it also made sense. Hence the set, and hence the clothes, which took the 1970s French working woman and plunked her in a galaxy far, far away with the turn of a heel. Tweed was paired with stargate shirting; the shoulders big and space-striped, like a pseudo-mantle; skirt suits layered under cosmic vests. The LV logo had been given an aerodynamic frame. Jolie madame on the bottom, sci-fi on top! A little scattershot overall. But haute Hollywood metallic silk halter-neck tops with athletic corsets atop black tuxedo trousers captured the best way to take off: under your own steam.",The New York Times
2018,"Finding Art in the Gut, and Other Unexpected Places","Vocations Angela McQuillan, 36, is the curator at the Esther Klein Gallery in Philadelphia. Is yours an independent gallery, or part of a university or another organization? We’re part of the University City Science Center, a nonprofit that helps entrepreneurs and scientists commercialize their technologies. The center is owned by 31 shareholders — universities and research institutions in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. The gallery’s mission is to bridge the gap between art and science and technology and provide a resource for the community. Do you have a science or an art background? Both. My first undergraduate degree is in biology. After graduating, I worked in a cancer research laboratory and then in vaccine manufacturing at a pharmaceutical company. My parents are research scientists, and I thought I might get a Ph.D. in science. However, I’d always been interested in art, so instead I got a bachelor’s in fine arts at night at Temple University. On the side, I was creating paintings inspired by human cells and other projects I was working on in the lab. In my personal art, I still often go back to the forms and structures I saw under the microscope. What does your role involve? I’m the only gallery employee. I develop the theme for each show and find the artists to take part, either online or at exhibitions or conferences, as examples. Planning for each show starts about a year ahead. I collaborate on the press releases and the catalog and visit the artists in their studios. I install each show with contractors. I also organize the artist lectures and workshops and tours for kids, and attend every event. How did you get this job? I exhibited my work here several years ago in a show based on microscopy — viewing objects through a microscope — and cellular structure. Three years later, I saw an ad on the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance website for this opening and applied. I think I was the only applicant with the dual background. Also, I had been independently curating shows in Philadelphia, so I had experience. I’ve been here almost four years. What was one of your favorite exhibitions? Last fall’s “Gut Love: You Are My Future,” which explored the human condition through the lens of the microbiome, the millions of bacteria living inside us. Kathy High, a visiting artist who has Crohn’s disease, did a series of symbolic photographs called “Kathy as Bowie.” In them she emulated iconic David Bowie portraits, juxtaposing the singer’s gut microbiome with her own. You’ve also had an artist collaborate with a scientist working at the Science Center. This winter, we paired a scientist researching taste receptors and how humans perceive bitter tastes with an artist in residence who makes artwork related to synthetic biology, or the combination of biology and engineering principles. To illustrate the scientist’s work, the artist is making a series of Popsicles that taste different depending which direction you eat from. As an example, the bottom tastes different from the top. How do you find the energy for your own art? My work here is cyclical. I’ll have a 60-hour week when I’m hanging an exhibition and arranging and hosting the reception, but then it calms down. When I started, I thought I’d be a full-time artist one day, but I’ve really grown to like this. Curating is creative. It has informed my art, and now the two are intermixed for me.",The New York Times
2018,Finding Charm in the East Village ‘Ice Cream District’,"The Hunt Conor Grady and Catherine Chiabaut met five years ago, as graduate students at Yale University, where he was in medical school and she was getting a Ph.D. in French literature. When Dr. Grady, now 30, left New Haven for New York City, to do his residency in neurosurgery at NYU Langone Medical Center, he decided he needed little more than a place to sleep. So he rented a small one-bedroom in Kips Bay — a ground-floor apartment with a concrete backyard and a view of the alley — for around $2,000 a month. Inside, there wasn’t room for much more than a collapsible table. “We didn’t like keeping the table open because it swallowed all of the space,” said Ms. Chiabaut, 26, who was still living in New Haven, where she was renting a one-bedroom for $1,065. The couple, who married a year and a half ago, traveled constantly between the two cities. And when Ms. Chiabaut completed her teaching requirements last spring, she joined her husband permanently in Manhattan. Moving immediately became a priority. Ms. Chiabaut works mostly from home, and the small, dark apartment felt suffocating. The couple also disliked Kips Bay, which to them felt soulless and lacking greenery, dominated by high-rises and sports bars. For fun, they often headed downtown. “Because Conor has relatively little free time, it was important to be in a neighborhood where we could easily go to a bar or restaurant, or meet up with friends,” Ms. Chiabaut said. They focused on the East Village, within walking distance of the hospitals on First Avenue. Their budget was $2,400 to $2,700, a little less than they had been paying to live separately. Browsing on the Naked Apartments website, they found Tamisha Arrendell, of Keller Williams TriBeCa. When a colleague of hers “asked us to describe our fantasy place,” Dr. Grady said, “I thought: a swimming pool and a helipad.” In truth, their requirements were few and their expectations low: All they really wanted was abundant light and enough room for a table. As Dr. Grady put it, “You’ve got to decide what’s essential and what you can compromise on.” Ms. Arrendell took them to see one-bedrooms in walk-up buildings, the area’s most common housing stock. One apartment on Second Avenue and East Third Street, for $2,575, felt like their old place, only not quite as small or as dark. To Dr. Grady, it — and everything else they saw — seemed fine, and certainly better than their old place. “I tended to see only the upside,” he said. Ms. Chiabaut was more discriminating. “We were having radically different reactions to the apartments,” she said. To her, “all of these apartments looked the same”: pricier than the old place, but no better. Both, however, were excited by a railroad-style one-bedroom on First Avenue that was a relatively large 600 square feet. As they climbed the stairs, they could see sunlight streaming from beneath the door. And the renovation was so recent they could smell the sawdust. “I don’t think I’d seen a place that was so aggressively new-appearing,” Dr. Grady said. Oddly, though, the bathroom was part of the kitchen, with two sliding doors: One hid a toilet and sink; the other, a stall shower. “Having seen mostly upgraded versions of what I knew to be a New York apartment, this was on a different plane,” Dr. Grady said, adding that he was even “charmed by the bathroom, after a while.” And there was room for negotiation in the $2,650 rent, Ms. Arrendell informed them. “The bathroom was strange and unconventional,” she said. “People were passing the unit up.” The couple’s only reservation was about the complete lack of closets. They visited one more prewar walk-up, on East 9th Street, listed at $2,325. It had two tiny bedrooms, but otherwise looked like all the rest. And there were other people at the open house who were ready to sign on. Several days passed, and the bathroom-in-the-kitchen apartment was still available. Their choice was clear. The couple agreed to a monthly rent of $2,600, and arrived in the late spring, after paying a broker’s fee of 15 percent of a year’s rent, or nearly $4,700. Soon after, they learned that their new home had at least one drawback: the constant noise from trucks barreling up the street. Now they run a fan at night, to generate white noise. Another, happier discovery was their new neighborhood’s specialty. “The biggest curiosity has been the ice cream shops per capita,” Dr. Grady said. “We are in the East Village’s ice cream district.” That alone “made us excited to move here, in a weird way,” Ms. Chiabaut said. “We felt we were moving into a truly different neighborhood. These stores are hyper-specialized, and they are not cheap. There’s one that sells only doughnuts stuffed with ice cream.” Ms. Chiabaut also enjoys being near Tompkins Square Park, where she can take a break from work during the day. “There wasn’t a place like that I could walk to in our old neighborhood,” she said. “Being here has made me more productive.” Inside the apartment, Ikea has helped with the closet situation. And the couple now has a table that seats six. “That’s very exciting for me,” Ms. Chiabaut said. “At the end of the day, when Conor finally comes home and we have dinner, it is nice to sit at the table.” She added: “I use that table a lot. I work on it, I have dinner with my husband — it symbolizes way too much for me.”",The New York Times
2018,Finding Meaning and Happiness in Old Age,"Personal Health What’s the best way to develop a healthy perspective on old age? Spend more time with elderly people and discover what brings meaning and pleasure to their twilight years despite the losses, both physical and social, they may have suffered. That’s what two authors of inspired and inspiring books about aging discovered and, happily, have taken the trouble to share with those of us likely to join the ranks of the “oldest old” in the not-too-distant future. Actually, the wisdom therein might be equally valuable for young and middle-aged adults who may dread getting old. To their detriment, some may even avoid interacting with old people lest their “disease” rub off on them. Too many in our youth-focused culture currently regard the elderly with fear or disdain and consider them costly consumers of resources with little to offer in return. Given the explosive pace of technology that often befuddles the elderly, they command little or no respect for the repository of wisdom that was once cherished by the young (and still is in some traditional societies). The first book I read was “The End of Old Age” by Dr. Marc E. Agronin, a geriatric psychiatrist at the Miami Jewish Home whose decades of caring for the aged have taught him that it is possible to maintain purpose and meaning in life even in the face of significant disease and disability, impaired mental and physical functioning and limited participation in activities. The second book, “Happiness Is a Choice You Make,” was written by John Leland, a reporter for The New York Times who spent a year interviewing and learning from six of the city’s “oldest old” residents — people 85 and above — from diverse cultures, backgrounds and life experiences. As Mr. Leland told me, “These people totally changed my life. They’ve given up distractions that make us do stupid things and instead focus on what’s important to them. To a person, they don’t worry about things that might happen. They worry when it happens, and even then they don’t worry. They just deal with it. At whatever age we are, we can choose to adapt to whatever happens. We have influence over whether we let things knock us out.” After reading the books, I have a new way of looking at myself: as a “good-enough” aging adult who continues to pursue and enjoy a variety of activities commensurate with the limitations imposed by inevitable changes in body and mind that accrue with advancing years. Never mind that words or spelling may temporarily escape me. I can always ask Google or Siri to fill in the blanks. I love the story in Dr. Agronin’s book about the renowned pianist Arthur Rubinstein “who dealt with age-induced declines in his skills by selecting a more limited repertoire, optimizing his performance through extra practice, and compensating by altering his tempo during certain sections to highlight the dynamics of a piece.” Dr. Agronin writes with reverence for Dr. Gene D. Cohen, a founding father of geriatric psychiatry who “saw not only what aging is, but what aging could be; not what we accomplish in spite of aging, but because of aging.” In Dr. Cohen’s model of creative aging, people have the potential to see possibility instead of problems; aging itself can be a catalyst for rich new experiences, offering a way to renew passions and reinvent oneself. There are activities I once loved that I can no longer do, or necessarily want to do, like tennis, skiing and ice skating. But I can still walk, cycle, swim, and frolic with my dog, activities that have resulted in many unexpected pleasures and new friends. I can accompany my grandsons to museums and delight in their knowledge of the Impressionists they studied in a high school art class. When I gave them tickets to join me at the opera, one said with a grin, “I guess I’ll get some culture.” I already know that if and when my physical abilities become further curtailed, I can still enjoy meaningful conversations with these boys, who are all-too-quickly becoming young men. They may know how to reset my cellphone or find hidden channels on my television, but I can help them put their life experiences in perspective and support a decision to leave their comfort zone and take risks that offer growth potential. As one of Dr. Agronin’s youngest informants said, even when physical decline and losses restrict one’s options, there remains the capacity to appreciate and approach each day with a sense of purpose. “It’s all about how you frame what you have,” she told him. He cites the concept of “positive aging” developed by Robert D. Hill, a psychologist in Salt Lake City, that is “affected by disease and disability, but not contingent upon avoiding it.” Rather, it is “a state of mind that is positive, optimistic, courageous, and able to adapt and cope in flexible ways with life’s changes.” Or, as Dr. Cohen found, creativity is not limited to young people. At any age, it can open people up to new possibilities and add richness to life. According to Dr. Cohen, creativity can benefit aging by strengthening morale, improving physical health, enriching relationships and establishing a legacy. Dr. Agronin cites two notable examples: Henri Matisse — “the man who rose from the dead” after cancer surgery in 1941 — who created cutouts when he could no longer paint, and Martha Graham, who reinvented herself as a choreographer when she could no longer dance. When we become unable to pursue the roles and passions of our younger years, Dr. Agronin says, we can tap into our past for strength and inspiration. We can try something new that is either an extension of what we did before or that takes us in a new direction. And, as Mr. Leland found, there is no room for regrets in happy aging. Although I never won a Pulitzer Prize, in many ways, the “awards” I’ve gotten from thousands of grateful readers who’ve been helped by my writings over the last half-century are so much more meaningful. These readers inspire me to continue doing what I do best — providing people with health- and lifesaving information and inspiration based on the best scientific evidence currently available. Citing the work of Laura L. Carstensen, founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, Mr. Leland writes that “older people, knowing they face a limited time in front of them, focus their energies on things that give them pleasure in the moment,” not on a future that may never be.",The New York Times
2018,Finding New Meaning in ‘Mean Girls’,"There are nights lately at the August Wilson Theater when the audience feels, to the creators of the musical comedy “Mean Girls,” like it’s full of Gretchens. Not people named Gretchen, that is, but rather people who identify with Gretchen, the most insecure member of the Plastics — the ruthless high school clique that rules the show, just as it rules the movie that inspired it. For those only vaguely familiar, Gretchen is the Plastic who keeps trying to make “fetch” happen. But in the musical — with a book by Tina Fey, adapted from her 2004 screenplay, which in turn is inspired by Rosalind Wiseman’s book “Queen Bees and Wannabes” — Gretchen also gets a poignant solo called “What’s Wrong With Me?,” the kind of emotional moment that just doesn’t appear in the film. It was one of the first songs that the composer Jeff Richmond (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”), who is married to Ms. Fey, and the lyricist Nell Benjamin (“Legally Blonde,” the musical) wrote for the show. “We talked about it being a real opportunity to get inside not just that character’s vulnerability,” Ms. Fey said, “but also the vulnerability of so many people that age.” Directed by the Tony Award winner Casey Nicholaw (“The Book of Mormon”) and opening on April 8, the musical is Ms. Fey’s Broadway debut. Though she is not reprising her film role as the teacher Ms. Norbury, caretaker of the mathletes, the gang’s all here: the vicious queen bee Regina George (and her wannabe-cool mom, Mrs. George); the dim-bulb Karen; the artsy outsiders Janis and Damian; and Cady, the previously home-schooled central character, who’s not doing so well at navigating the social land mines of high school life. Last November, when the musical made its premiere at the National Theater in Washington, D.C., the Washington Post critic Peter Marks wrote that it felt “less like an artistic reinvention than a commercial knockoff.” Since then, its creators — who, with the exception of Ms. Fey and Mr. Richmond, did not know one another before the project began — have been busy with fixes, including five new songs. “We ripped the show completely apart from D.C.,” Mr. Nicholaw said. Early on a snowy evening in the second week of previews, they straggled into a steakhouse down the block from the theater, ordered coffee like the night owls that they are and talked about bringing “Mean Girls” to Broadway. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What are the pitfalls in adapting from screen to stage? CASEY NICHOLAW The biggest mistake is when you’re like, “We have to give the fans everything they want.” The fact that Tina didn’t want to do that was a huge relief to me. All of us inherently know what’s theatrical and what needs to be onstage. JEFF RICHMOND The biggest laugh lines are not the ones from the movie. TINA FEY Which makes sense, because laughs are usually generated by some element of surprise. It’s hard to get a laugh on something people know is coming. NELL BENJAMIN There are some people who are like, “Is there going to be a song called ‘Fetch’?” But if you think it through, how long do you want to sit in a song that’s based on one really good joke? RICHMOND We had a ridiculous idea for a moment where the entire curtain call was going to be a medley of the songs you thought would be in it, all the iconic moments. Like “Fetch” and “On Wednesdays We Wear Pink” and — what’s the one about sluts? FEY, NICHOLAW, BENJAMIN “Boo, You Whore.” How do you make a musical that pits girls against girls at a time when the culture is more excited about female unity than we’ve ever seen? FEY It is interesting. Since the film, we have ostensibly more female unity. But we also have trouble, right? We have white feminism and intersectional feminism. We have women not believing women. But it also does feel like the message of the show has expanded beyond just relational aggression among females, and it’s sort of about relational aggression, which has metastasized in many ways. BENJAMIN It’s not just girls being mean to girls. It’s whoever’s on top thinking it’s O.K. to push downhill. Right now, people are deeply impressed with the youth of America. Does that impact the show? FEY It does. We talk about it. We have a new song at the top of the second act called “Stop.” It’s sort of a comedic song about impulse control, and Nell and I are both so mindful about making sure that it’s not judging just girls for the choices they make. In some ways, it makes sense that our heroine by the end of the show is living her authentic life and being her best self — that she is teaching us. The musical feels kinder than the movie. FEY I think that partly is the form, because once you hear people sing, then you’re in their hearts. I always felt empathy for Gretchen in the movie and for Cady, for all of them. But I think it’s because of music. NICHOLAW It sweetens everything up whether you want it to or not. BENJAMIN I can’t not like a person I’m going to write a song for. NICHOLAW We try to make sure that we undercut the sweet as much as we can. BENJAMIN And sneak the message in. Does having kids, maybe daughters in particular, affect your writing at all? FEY When I first got Rosalind to license the book to us, I sort of promised her that we would honor the intention, which was to be helpful. We’ve carried that through. BENJAMIN At 5, my daughter is already not on board for lectures. I have a lot that I want to say to her, but I cannot lecture her. In that respect it’s probably improved my writing, because I’m like, how am I going to work around a 5-year-old’s defenses? It better be funny. I wasn’t thinking of the messaging so much as the tenderness of the show. It made me wonder if you’re writing more tenderly. RICHMOND I think maybe. FEY A moment of the show that has finally come to work, something that we struggled with, was the way we use Mrs. George — just wanting to represent a mother and acknowledge that grown women are judgmental of each other, too, and that we as the audience look at this character in the first act like: Oh, she’s a clown. And just wanting to find a way to empathize with her. That was important to me especially, and that is, yes, probably because I am a mother now, and when I wrote the movie I was not. There’s a poster outside the theater with photos of your little awkward-slash-adorable adolescent selves. Nerds are very dear to the show’s heart, it seems. FEY It’s brought me so much joy, how much audiences have responded to the mathletes segment. I think embracing nerdery is what Cady does in a way. She embraces a part of herself that is not perceived to be cool. That’s at the core of the story. RICHMOND Rooting for the underdogs. FEY With the exception of Regina, every other character believes themselves to be an underdog in some way. NICHOLAW Everyone can relate to that, especially in high school. How I coped was doing musicals. I was a gay kid that couldn’t come out because it was 1979, and I didn’t fit in anywhere and I didn’t like sports and I was called all kinds of things. So I found theater, and I found where I did belong. Damian is like a valentine to every drama nerd who ever was. RICHMOND Yeah. There’s this meta thing going on, too, because in the movie, you don’t get to see Damian actually in that world. You know he cares about it, but now you see the Damian within a musical theater structure who loves musical theater. BENJAMIN And makes it happen wherever he goes. What difference to your writing comes from having the audience in the room with you? FEY It’s super helpful. You can take your own sense of humor as a guide for only so long, and then you’ve got to get it up in front of an audience. This is so much more alive, to have the chance every night to adjust things. RICHMOND It’s also so much more rewarding. When you’re doing television, you don’t see the people who are enjoying your thing. I find myself spending so much time watching people in the audience. NICHOLAW I spend a lot of time deciding if I’m going to tell that person to stop crinkling their wrapper. RICHMOND That’s why TV is better. Tina, you’re the Broadway newbie. After “Mean Girls,” will theater see more of you? FEY I would love to. Maybe we have to come up with something wholly original. But this process has been a joy. I know enough, just peripherally, to know that it could have been a bad arranged marriage, so I feel really very lucky.",The New York Times
2018,Finding Tenderness in Communities Affected by Manila’s Anti-Drug Killings,"lens Hannah Reyes Morales photographed more than 20 corpses, as well as police officers and grieving families throughout Manila in 2016. She was not alone. Many local and international photographers were often nearby documenting the death toll from the brutal war on drugs started by Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president. After a few nights, she grew tired of photographing the murder scenes that dominated the coverage. She admired her colleagues’ commitment to documenting the killings, but she felt she had little to add that was new. Instead, she turned her attention to the residents of the densely packed slums where most of the bodies were found. “Crowds of families and children would gather to see what was going on, to see the journalists, to see the body, to see the police,” she said. “And then after the body would be packed up, people would retreat back into their homes very quietly. And I knew that the next day that they would have just a normal day.” Most of the international coverage focused on the bodies and where they were found, Ms. Morales, 27, explained. But there are also “people and communities that continue to live amid all this violence and all this death.” Since they were often overlooked, she said, she decided to photograph the daily lives of residents of these impoverished neighborhoods and put “a human face on those who are most affected.” Ms. Morales returned to the scenes where she had photographed bodies and got to know the people who lived there. And she kept going back, visiting people at home and listening to their stories. Some of the people she photographed had lost a loved one to the drug wars, but many of them were neighbors. The Philippine government insists that fewer than 4,000 people have been killed since Mr. Duterte took office in 2016. But last month, Human Rights Watch estimated that more than 12,000 suspected drug users and dealers, mostly from poor families, have died in the crackdown. Many of these killings occurred in a handful of very poor neighborhoods throughout Manila. International news media outlets paid attention as the body count skyrocketed in 2016, but most foreign journalists drifted away even as the killings continued through 2017. Between other assignments Ms. Morales continued to photograph the people who lived amid the violence. Ms. Morales grew up in Manila, where she lived in a modest home with her single mother and more than a dozen relatives. It was, she said, “a simple life.” Going to school, she passed by informal settlements where people lived in ramshackle houses. She attended an all-girls Catholic school run by activist nuns, where part of the curriculum took students to visit these neighborhoods to see how others lived and to help them. In high school, Ms. Morales volunteered to tutor children in these communities in reading and writing. Though she was not wealthy, she was “ luckier then they were,” she said. Yet she identified with these children and working with them was a formative experience. “I was always very much aware and curious about their lives, and I was already interested in photography, but I didn’t have a camera yet,” she said. “I wanted to photograph them, but l just didn’t have the means.” Ms. Morales studied communication at the University of the Philippines, where she took a photography class. She got an internship with EPA, the European Pressphoto Agency, during which she had a photo published on Lens in Photos of the Day. She has been on assignment for National Geographic and CNN Philippines and has photographed for and contributed reporting to The New York Times. Though the killings have slowed, Ms. Morales continues working on her project whenever she is home. Most of the people she photographs take pride in their community, she said, though gun violence was “just like a matter of fact for them and a part of daily life.” Her subjects are “well aware of the cards they have been dealt,” she said, yet “full of grace and very resilient.” “We Filipinos are a hopeful people,” Ms. Morales said. “The tenderness and the love that I try to convey in the images for me is a part of the Filipino resilience — they keep their quality of life going even as all of this violence is happening around you.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,Finding a Home After a Fire: ‘It Feels Like Your Life Is on Pause’,"One family’s search for an affordable apartment in an increasingly unaffordable city after one of New York City’s deadliest fires. Kadian Blake waited inside a car for her husband, Gawayne Blake, as he picked up food at a favorite Jamaican restaurant near their old apartment in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx.CreditCreditPhotographs by Sarah Blesener for The New York Times Gawayne and Kadian Blake emerged from another interview for an apartment, again empty-handed. It has been almost three months since a fire raged through their Bronx apartment building, killing 13 people, including five of the Blakes’ relatives. It was the deadliest fire in New York City in nearly three decades, and it left the Blakes and 29 other families searching for new places to live as they cope with the loss of loved ones and the homes that had held their families together. Outside the rental office, Mr. Blake opened the car door and pulled out a bouquet of white roses that remained from the funeral and turned toward a trash can. The flowers had turned a pale yellow and were as fragile as parchment. “Don’t throw those away,” Ms. Blake told him from the sidewalk. She wanted the flowers pressed, she said, as a keepsake for their new home, whenever they found one. But that felt a long way off. The family’s search for an apartment they can afford has come up empty. The city’s housing market is painfully tight, and rents have been soaring in the Bronx, where they want to remain. With a baby due in May, they are eager to start rebuilding their lives and making a new home. Fires displace hundreds of New Yorkers every year, and recovery is often slow and difficult. Many of the 30 families, consisting of 64 adults and 23 children, that lost apartments in the Dec. 28 inferno remain in limbo, living in shelters or hotels paid for by the city. Their five-story, rent-stabilized building in the Belmont neighborhood offered rents ranging from $920 to $1,300, and tenants have struggled to find similarly priced apartments in New York, which has a shortage of affordable housing and one of the highest average rents in the country. The Blakes are doubly burdened: They are among the tenants who lost loved ones in the fire that also took their home. For them, the hunt for an apartment, important as it is, often feels trivial, overshadowed by grief. “The only thing we’ve been thinking about has been our loss,” Mr. Blake said. “We haven’t even thought about ourselves. I feel like it’s not even a reality that they passed away. “Even though I’ve seen the bodies, I can’t accept it.” The deadly fire was started by a 3-year-old boy who was playing with a stove in his family’s apartment on the first floor of the building, at 2363 Prospect Avenue. His mother left the door to the apartment ajar as she fled with the boy and a younger child, creating a draft that fueled the fast-moving flames, fire officials have said. Among the dead were Karen Stewart-Francis, 37, who was Ms. Blake’s aunt; her daughters, Kylie, 2, and Kelesha, 7; and her niece, Shawntay Young, 19. Firefighters found them huddled in the bathroom of their fifth-floor apartment, dead from smoke inhalation, according to the medical examiner’s office. Ms. Stewart-Francis’s husband, Holt Francis, 27, was taken to the hospital in critical condition and died a week later after being taken off life support. They were all part of a close-knit family that had emigrated from Jamaica. More than a dozen members of the extended clan lived in the century-old building, where they enjoyed gathering for barbecues outside on Saturdays. Mr. Blake, 34, and Ms. Blake, 32, shared wedding anniversaries and birthdays with the adults. Their 10-year-old son, Jeremiah, considered Kylie and Kalesha his sisters; he gave a eulogy at their funeral. The search for an apartment in New York can be a consuming, grinding ordeal for almost anyone. But for the Blakes, every failed attempt is another reminder of the event that upended their worlds. Since the fire, the Blakes have crammed into a familiar space: the apartment of Ms. Blake’s mother near Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, which is a 15-minute car ride from their old neighborhood. Ms. Blake’s two younger brothers also live in the one-bedroom apartment that was converted into a two-bedroom by building a makeshift wooden wall in the living room. They all share one bathroom. The husband, wife and son all share the same bed. Their clothes, some salvaged, some donated, overflow from suitcases stacked high. Plastic bags stuffed with belongings cover the dining room table. The entranceway and living room are an obstacle course of boxes and plastic tubs. The city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development temporarily accommodates New Yorkers displaced by fires or city-issued orders to vacate apartments. The department’s three shelters, with a total of 225 units for families with children, are full, city officials said. That has left more than 600 displaced families in the 17 hotels the department works with in Manhattan, Bronx and Queens. Only 18 of the 30 families displaced by the Bronx fire registered with the city. Of these, nine families remain in temporary emergency housing arranged by the city, five are living with relatives and four have found permanent new homes, according to the housing department. The Blakes hope to continue living in the Bronx so Jeremiah can remain at his school. “When we ride out a storm together, you’re stronger for it at the end,” said Ms. Blake’s mother, Andrene Paul, greeting her daughter as she returned from the disappointing interview. That day in late January, the couple had been applying for an apartment with Bronx Pro Group, which manages more than 70 affordable housing buildings in the city. For over an hour, they sat in a lilac-colored room going over paperwork with a company employee. They were missing their social security cards and Jeremiah’s birth certificate. But it would not matter. They were told they did not qualify for affordable housing. Their income exceeded the maximum income for a family of four — $57,240 — to be eligible. (The couple’s baby, due in mid-May, was taken into account.) Even if the family had qualified, only 2 percent of the 1,975 apartments that Bronx Pro Group owns are vacant, said Samantha Magistro, the company’s managing director of new business. For those who work in the affordable housing industry, the struggle is evident every time they turn a family away because of availability. “If I had to go through this process, I would go crazy,” said Jennifer Ryan, a Bronx Pro Group manager. The Blakes, who left Jamaica in 2004, had paid about $1,020 a month for their third-floor apartment, where they lived for more than six years. The rent allowed them to have certain comforts, as Mr. Blake puts it. They could afford two cars and occasional trips to visit family in the Caribbean. But their finances have been strained in the aftermath of the fire. They spent the better part of January organizing and helping to pay for funeral services in the Bronx, followed by burials in Jamaica, where they stayed for more than a week. They contributed $4,000 toward the funerals, and are paying hundreds of dollars every month to store their salvaged furniture. They now find themselves in a predicament familiar to many families searching for an apartment: They make too much to qualify for government-subsidized housing, but are hard-pressed to afford a market-rate unit. The listings Ms. Blake has found as she scouts the internet advertise rents ranging from $1,700 to $2,100 a month, and are beyond their reach, she said. Mr. Blake recently went back to work as a collector for a private sanitation company. Ms. Blake, a phone operator for the city’s 311 help line, hasn’t clocked in since the fire. “I’m not ready to go back to work, emotionally,” Ms. Blake said. But the couple have depleted their savings, and the financial implications are weighing on the family. As a result of the stress, Ms. Blake has sought help at the hospital numerous times during her pregnancy. Doctors said the couple’s unborn daughter has a high heart rate and elevated blood pressure. The smell of smoke can trigger anxiety in Mr. Blake. Still, the fire’s effect on Jeremiah has been starkest. The night of the fire, Mr. and Ms. Blake were fast asleep, even as smoke began to fill their apartment and other tenants scrambled down fire escapes. It was Jeremiah who woke them. “Mommy, it smells like smoke,” he told his mother. The Blakes were the last family to descend a fire escape at the back of the building. Jeremiah, a fifth grader, has felt responsible for his parents’ safety ever since, they said. He had a panic attack while at school in late January and had to be taken out of a classroom so he could call his parents to make sure they were safe. “We don’t want our child to feel that he needs to protect us,” Mr. Blake told his wife as they rode in the car. Jeremiah has told his parents he is afraid to live in an apartment building. He began seeing a psychiatrist last month; so did his parents. “Sometimes when I’m by myself I have that breakdown, but not in front of Jeremiah,” Mr. Blake said. Ms. Blake says she sometimes avoids text messages and phone calls for days at a time. She finds solace in the images on the camera memory cards she salvaged from her aunt’s apartment. In one video, she discovered Kylie, the 2-year-old, dancing to Jamaican music in a living room. Mr. Holt-Francis had urged her on playfully as he filmed the toddler while his wife was at work. “I had never seen that side of him,” said Ms. Blake, watching the video on her phone and holding back tears. On a recent Sunday, the Blakes rested in their temporary apartment. Mr. Blake and Jeremiah shared a couch with Ms. Blake’s brother, Michael, and watched television. The Boston Celtics were playing the Cleveland Cavaliers. The father and son exchanged their usual banter, jokingly calling each other “punks.” Ms. Blake looked up a slime recipe for Jeremiah’s science project. It had been several weeks since they last received apartment leads from the city’s housing department, and Ms. Blake had become resigned to giving up on the search until after the baby was born. Out of desperation, Mr. Blake contacted the city to ask about being placed in a shelter. The housing agency told them there was an availability, but Ms. Blake isn’t enthused by the idea. “I don’t want to be in a shelter, be bringing my kid back from school to a shelter,” Ms. Blake said. “We’re not really homeless, but it definitely puts it into perspective.” She said she craved a degree of normalcy. “It feels like your life is on pause,” she said. “It feels like you can’t do anything until you have a roof over your head. You don’t feel grounded.” On the street outside the apartment, inside the trunk of their car, the white roses from the funeral were still waiting to be pressed. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of apartments and the vacancy rate based on information provided by the owner, Bronx Pro Group. It manages 1,975 apartments, not 4,000, and the vacancy rate is 2 percent, not four vacant units.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Finding the Poetry in March Madness,"Op-Ed Contributor CHICAGO — Last Thursday night, Loyola University Chicago tipped off against Nevada at 6:07 p.m. in the Sweet Sixteen of the N.C.A.A. tournament. The weekly two-and-a-half-hour poetry workshop I teach at Loyola was scheduled to start at 7. As I crossed campus, raucous cheers rose from the student center, hundreds of yards away. Lake Michigan crashed into the rocks behind the library, frothing like victory champagne. There was no one outside. Apart from a lone rabbit, nothing moved on the quad. Two of my students had emailed earlier in the day to say they’d be absent due to March Madness. Loyola hadn’t made the N.C.A.A. tournament in 33 years. I didn’t know if a single student would show for class. As I approached our building, the roar from the student center grew louder, as did the mixed feelings I’ve had about college sports. I’ve loved basketball since I was a boy and played varsity for my high school. Most of my friends in college were athletes, not poets. But over the last two decades, college sports have become big business. In 2016, the highest-paid state employee in 39 states was a college coach — not the governor, not the state university’s president. Each year, N.C.A.A. Division I athletic departments generate billions of dollars in revenue. To keep the money pouring into their programs, and into their own pockets, coaches have to win. The student-athletes at these big-time schools become in-house professional athletes, without the paychecks, but often with plenty of valuable perks. Their training, practice and game schedules leave little time for class, let alone studying. Many don’t get diplomas, which they’ll need because the majority of them won’t play pro. Loyola, of course, is not one of those big-money schools. Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, the team’s chaplain, was the only person involved with the team whose name I knew before the tournament began. I’d never even seen a student wear a Loyola basketball shirt on campus. When the team upset the highly ranked Florida during the regular season, my excitement was met with genial indifference. The evidence that sports fit into life at Loyola was that they were largely invisible. After class each Thursday, I’d cut through the halls by Gentile Arena, past faded black-and-white photographs of earlier teams and inspirational quotations on the walls. A few student-athletes would be returning from the training room. Just another night for them, pursuing sports, as the N.C.A.A. Core Values state, as “an avocation.” But now the basketball team was in the Sweet Sixteen on national television. Barack Obama was tweeting about Sister Jean. However briefly, Loyola athletics had entered the big time, which didn’t bode well for academics. As I crossed the campus, I saw that the only classrooms with lights on had the game playing on large screens. Eleven of 14 students, all women, showed up for class (there is only one male student in our class). We talked about the Nick Flynn poems they’d been assigned. But cheering surged from down the hall as the second half began. At the students’ urging, we watched the rest of the game together on the large screen in the classroom. During the commercial breaks, I tried to think of a way to justify the decision pedagogically (the uses and abuses of alliteration: March Madness versus Elite Eight; or maybe, why sportscasters love clichés). But as we watched, that need felt less and less urgent. One student did mention the power of juxtaposition, how at the end of the previous game the coverage cut between a beaming Sister Jean and a bawling Tennessee fan. Another student, after the game concluded with Loyola beating Nevada, said, “We should write a poem — it felt like my heart was beating outside my chest!” But after a short break, we returned to the syllabus. To my amazement, the spirit of the game, the sense of all being on the same team, carried into our discussion of a student’s poem. Comments, which usually last for about 10 minutes, went on much longer. The poem, about a student missing her native Nigeria, drew encouraging consideration from her classmates. When class ended, I figured everyone would rush off, but no one seemed in a hurry. Camaraderie had entered the room. Three students approached me — one about a poetry fellowship, another about a poem about trampolines and the Nigerian student about a poem she was writing on womanhood. As she and I left the building, the campus thrummed with celebration, cheers rising from dorm rooms and passing cars. Another student from class, who lived on the South Side and had an hour-and a-half commute ahead of her, crossed the quad with us. She said the victory felt like the Cubs’ World Series victory in miniature. We walked slowly, absorbing the night, its unlikely rhyme of poetry and basketball. I asked the student from the South Side about her commute, what route she took. The Nigerian student asked her what she did with the travel time. They talked about reading on train rides, and about the desire to observe others without being seen. They talked about making a T-shirt that said, “I’m a writer — please don’t mind if I watch you.” The basketball game had come and gone, but its energy was still carrying them. This Saturday, during the Final Four, I’ll be rooting for Loyola — for the team to win, and, more deeply, for the balanced role of sports at the university not to change. For both to happen, it’ll take a miracle.",The New York Times
2018,Finding the Right Corporate Message Isn’t Always Easy,"Entrepreneurship Hildy Kuryk was thinking about working at a hedge fund. “I think you’ll find it boring,” Anna Wintour told her. It was 2013, and Ms. Kuryk — who had just left her post as the national finance director of the Democratic National Committee — was at Condé Nast seeking career advice from the well-connected Vogue editor in chief. Ms. Wintour was right. After a couple of meetings, Ms. Kuryk knew the finance game was not for her. Instead, Ms. Kuryk soon found herself back at Condé Nast, no longer looking for a job but serving as Vogue’s director of communications, and the media gatekeeper to Ms. Wintour (who doubles as the artistic director of Condé Nast). But in June, Ms. Kuryk decided to strike out on her own and start a consulting film, Artemis Strategies, which she is pitching to clients as a vehicle to help them craft their message for socially aware consumers. “People have been giving away money generously for decades. That’s not in dispute,” Ms. Kuryk, 40, said during a recent interview in the office she now rents from Condé Nast at 1 World Trade Center. “I can help consumer-facing companies deepen their civic engagement and tell their value story better.” Those companies also need to navigate potential pitfalls. As the firm’s website states, “In an unpredictable political landscape brands need to be acutely aware and cautious who they align with.” Ms. Wintour, for one, seems to think starting a consulting firm is a good career move for Ms. Kuryk. “You could say we took a risk hiring Hildy back in 2013 — she came from politics and made no pretense that she knew much about the fashion world,” she said. “But the risk paid off. Hildy is smart, a quick study, and, best of all, her judgment is sound.” Ms. Kuryk has two simultaneous goals with Artemis. The first is to make sure brands like Pepsi never release another ad like 2017’s disastrous conflation of Kendall Jenner, protest and the Black Lives Matter movement. The second is to reinvent the concept of corporate social responsibility by integrating it into every aspect of a company’s management, and not shunt it off, she said, to “a separate office down the hall.” Partly because of the reach of social media, partly because of a new era of civic engagement (some of it in response to the polarizing first year of the Trump administration), corporations are increasingly embracing message-based marketing. Examples include Nickelodeon’s going off the air for 17 minutes in solidarity with victims of gun violence, McDonald’s turning its golden arches upside down to mark International Women’s Day. “Companies are being asked and demanded to state their values,” Ms. Kuryk said. “And how they seize this moment could pay massive business and messaging dividends for them.” But not all such moves have gone smoothly, from that short-lived Pepsi commercial to the widely criticized Ram commercial, aired during the Super Bowl this year, that used a sermon from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to sell trucks, to the criticism (by, among others, Chance the Rapper) of Heineken’s series of commercials for its light beer and the tagline, “Sometimes, Lighter Is Better.” “The Pepsi and Kendall Jenner thing — I was tearing my hair out,” Ms. Kuryk said. “I wanted to be there long before they shot it so I could say: ‘Hey, guys, I know some people. Let’s call them.’” Born and raised in Manhattan, Ms. Kuryk graduated from Vanderbilt with a degree in political science. She worked in Bill Clinton’s White House and as a fund-raiser for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign before joining the finance wing of the Democratic National Committee. With her business not yet a year old, Ms. Kuryk has picked up some splashy clients, including Nordstrom (a company about to open the first Manhattan location for its flagship brand, a men’s wear shop, at 235 West 57th), the news briefing service the Skimm, as well as Condé Nast, with a focus on Vogue and its high-profile Met Gala. Ms. Kuryk’s experience of toggling between the private and public sectors could help her take advantage of the openings in a rapidly developing market. “There’s huge demand right now for professionals who can teach businesses how to navigate these new consumer expectations and for corporations to take stances on political issues and practice good corporate social responsibility,” said Kara Alaimo, assistant professor of public relations at Hofstra University. “What’s astonishing is that we’re consistently seeing major brands who can’t seem to apply basic principles of how to make decisions when they’re taking stances on political issues,” she added. And it will only become more important. A recent paper titled “The Dawn of CEO Activism,” published by the public relations giant Weber Shandwick, noted that millennials — consumers ages 18 to 35 — showed the greatest positive response to corporate activism. Which raises a question: Isn’t this more of a gig for an actual millennial? “You can’t have a millennial do this job, because you need someone who actually has some real experience — up and down,” Ms. Kuryk said. Dr. Alaimo backed her up: “My feeling is you do want a seasoned professional. It’s not a case where a millennial can intuit what will work. You want to be making decisions based on research and best practices.” And having some very well-known names in her corner can’t hurt. “She treats everyone with respect and appreciation for the value of the role they play,” said Valerie Jarrett, the former senior White House adviser to Mr. Obama, who has worked closely with Ms. Kuryk over the years. “That’s the skill set that will make her very effective with clients.” OpinionNathaniel Friedman",The New York Times
2018,Fire Island Cabin Sale Incites Rebellion Over Seaside Haven,"ATLANTIQUE, N.Y. — John Maier stood inside the Appalachian Mountain Club’s Fire Island cabin recently and described waking up there during the summer. “It’s amazing to get up, go right outside and see egrets or great blue herons,” said Mr. Maier, a club volunteer who helps run the cabin. “This place is one of a kind.” Generations of club members have paid nominal fees to use the rustic cabin, which sits on 1.4 acres facing the Great South Bay. But now the club, which has about 100,000 paid members nationwide, is thinking about selling the property that members say includes land donated in 1928. This month the club, which is based in Boston, said it had new concerns about the cabin and its location on a slender barrier island between the bay and the Atlantic Ocean, citing “the residential character of the surrounding neighborhood, limited flexibility in lodging options and access and its proximity to rising seas.” After an outcry by members of the New York-North Jersey chapter, a vote on the proposed sale was delayed. Still, talk of a sale has created something of a mutiny within the mountain club, which was founded in 1876 to promote the protection, enjoyment and understanding of the mountains, forests, waters and trails of the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. Members of the New York-North Jersey Chapter have said that a sale would betray the club’s conservationist principles and fear that the property, which they said is used by migrating monarch butterflies and mating horseshoe crabs, would end up in the hands of a developer. The stakes of the debate may be heightened by the fact that it involves Fire Island, a 32-mile ribbon of beaches, towns and wilderness with a history of preservation. Automobiles are restricted there. Red foxes and eastern cottontail rabbits roam a protected area called the Sunken Forest. In the 1960s, residents thwarted a proposal by Robert Moses to build a highway along the island’s spine. Several club members have said that they cherish the cabin, less than two hours from Manhattan and accessible by train and ferry, because of the camaraderie and affordable access to nature it provides. Between May and October up to 24 visitors at a time sleep in bunk beds, paying $30 to $50 for weeknights or about $200 for two-night weekend stays that include free communal meals. Two summer midweeks are reserved for use by families. Visitors share chores and organize yoga sessions, hikes and bird-watching sorties. “To go from a concrete jungle to a seaside respite changes your vibration,” said Cindy Arlinsky, a member of the club’s Fire Island Cabin Committee. “Just being there makes you feel healthy.” Many members said they were surprised to learn that the club was considering a sale. Diane Serlin, the chairwoman of the cabin committee, said that the club’s president, John Judge, and a member of the board of directors met with her on March 2 in Manhattan and told her that the cabin would be sold as quickly as possible and would not be available for use this summer. “It was like getting hit on the head with a hammer,” she said, adding that she was pleased by the club’s decision to allow for a fuller debate. The board was to discuss the matter during a March 15 meeting in Boston and, Mr. Judge said, could have voted then to pursue a sale. Club members in New York voiced opposition. On March 14, the club announced on its website that it would delay any vote, adding that over the next year it would “continue evaluating the use and impact of the cabin as part of the A.M.C. mission while also engaging in further dialogue.” Mr. Judge said that there was no urgency to sell and that the club would conduct a “listening tour” on the issue. But the club also had to allocate resources carefully, he added, and weigh questions about holding onto a cabin that had room for limited visitors and could be jeopardized by powerful storms. “It comes down to this idea of mission impact,” he said. “We have to pick and choose how to do the most good.” A March 9 memo sent from the club’s vice president of outdoor operations, Paul Cunha, to board members said use of the cabin had gradually decreased over the past decade and that club officials had been discussing selling the property since November. Mr. Cunha added that a realtor had suggested a sale price of $1.7 million. Robert Kuhar, a licensed associate real estate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who has sold properties on Fire Island, said that the mountain club property could, subject to variables like deed restrictions, topography and zoning rules, be divided into as many as eight buildable lots that could sell for $400,000 to $600,000 apiece. Several club members have said that they will continue to oppose a sale of the cabin and hope to persuade the board that it is worth keeping. Mr. Maier said the one-year delay meant that the cabin would be open this summer. On St. Patrick’s Day he gave a tour of the property, which also includes a garden and a gazebo lined with bookshelves and chairs. He picked up a photograph taken after a hurricane in 1961 and noted that a stand of trees near the cabin had not yet existed. “This land has been able to grow because it hasn’t been developed,” he said. “It’s been able to find its own way.”",The New York Times
2018,Fire at Azerbaijan Drug Treatment Clinic Kills at Least 24,"BAKU, Azerbaijan — At least 24 people died in a fire early Friday at a drug rehabilitation clinic in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, the authorities said. The police and prosecutors said in a joint statement that the fire broke out in an old, one-story wooden building around 6 a.m. and burned for three hours. The blaze was attributed to a short circuit. The Health Ministry said that 200 patients and staff had been evacuated, 34 had been rescued and three had been hospitalized. The office of President Ilham Aliyev said he had arrived at the scene to oversee the rescue effort and had ordered an investigation into the blaze.",The New York Times
2018,Firefighter Dies in a Harlem Fire on Film Set,"A New York firefighter was killed and two others were seriously injured by a fire at a building in Harlem that was being used as a film set, officials said Friday morning. The five-alarm fire broke out in the basement of 773 St. Nicholas Avenue shortly before 11 p.m. Thursday, Daniel A. Nigro, the New York City fire commissioner, said during a news conference early Friday. The building is the former site of St. Nick’s Pub, which closed in 2011. “Conditions worsened after the hose lines were brought down to the cellar,” Commissioner Nigro said. The flames climbed up through the building and were seen coming through the roof. The commissioner said that it had not yet been determined how the fire had started. Michael R. Davidson, 37, was responsible for operating the fire hose nozzle for Engine Company 69, the first to arrive, the commissioner said. He was somehow separated from other firefighters when the blaze intensified and forced them to pull back from the building, officials said. When he was found by other firefighters, he was unconscious, and critically injured. He was taken to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. “New York City is in mourning tonight,” Councilman Mark D. Levine said of Mr. Davidson in a tweet. “He made the ultimate sacrifice to save the lives of our neighbors. Horrific tragedy. We pray for his family and loved ones.” Firefighter Davidson was a 15-year veteran of the Fire Department and had been cited for bravery four times, the department said. The names of the two injured firefighters, who were being treated for burns, were not released. Commissioner Nigro said that fighting a fire in a cellar is one of the most dangerous tasks that firefighters take on, and that in a building that isn’t fireproof, like the one on St. Nicholas Avenue, flames are liable to spread rapidly. Several other firefighters had less serious injuries and three civilians received minor injuries, the commissioner said. “This is an awful night,” Eric Phillips, press secretary for Mayor Bill de Blasio, wrote on Twitter. “We’ve lost an NYC firefighter.” “Sick to my stomach,” he added. Mr. Phillips said that Mr. de Blasio, who on Thursday had flown to Florida, where his baseball team, the Boston Red Sox, have spring training, would return to New York on Friday to grieve with Firefighter Davidson’s family and colleagues. The building, which was one of Harlem’s few remaining jazz clubs before it closed, was being used for the filming of “Motherless Brooklyn,” neighbors said on social media. The film, based on a book by Jonathan Lethem about a detective with Tourette’s syndrome, stars Bruce Willis and Edward Norton, who is also the director. William Johnson, 61, who lives on the block, said the fire “looked crazy, like in the movies.” “It was like a big torch burning up everything,” he added. The crew had been filming on and off for several weeks in the Harlem location, and Thursday seemed to neighbors like a particularly busy day. Actors in period costumes were spotted milling about in the morning, and the crew was still present on the block as late as 10:30 p.m. Early Friday morning, the interior of the building looked to be completely gutted, and a neighboring building appeared to have been damaged. A movie supply truck was parked on the street, across from a fleet of classic cars, including a blue finned Chevrolet Bel Air and a green Ford Customline. (The film is set in 1950s New York.) In a statement, the film’s producers offered condolences to Firefighter Davidson’s family. The statement said that the fire started toward the end of the production’s working day, when the dozens of people working on site noticed smoke coming into their set from below. “To our great sorrow, we now know that a NYC firefighter lost his life battling the blaze that grew, and our hearts ache in solidarity with his family,” the statement said. “New York City firefighters truly are the bravest in the world. We watched firsthand with astonishment as they charged into the smoke to make sure all were safely out and then fought to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading.” A spokeswoman for the producers said the cause of the fire was not yet known. Barbara Holliday, who lives across the street from the building, saw three Fire Department personnel standing beside an empty stretcher when she emerged from her building on Friday in the morning’s first light. “I’m so sorry, I heard,” she told them, dabbing her eyes. She said she had known for weeks that a movie was being filmed across the street and became friendly with some members of the film crew, who were popular in the neighborhood because they allowed neighbors to pose for photos with the vintage cars. Ms. Holliday, a block resident for almost 20 years, stared at the charred shell of the building, with fire engines out in front among the classic cars, and the glass smashed out of all the windows. Firefighter Davidson, who comes from a family of firefighters, is survived by his wife, Eileen, and four children. He was the 1,150th firefighter in the 153-year history of the department to die in the line of duty, Commissioner Nigro said.",The New York Times
2018,Firefighter Killed in Harlem Blaze Praised as a ‘Hero of the Highest Order’,"The bagpipes had stopped, the drums gone quiet. The funeral was about to begin. A fire engine rolled to a stop in front of St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue on Tuesday morning, and the surrounding blocks went still. Atop the fire engine was a coffin, mounted high and shrouded in the flag of the New York Fire Department. No one among the thousands of firefighters, city leaders, family members, friends and strangers paying respects seemed to move. In the middle of Midtown Manhattan, the snap of a flag in the breeze could be heard down the block. It stayed this way for minutes, as if to give the body in the coffin, Lt. Michael R. Davidson, a 37-year-old nozzle man in Harlem whose last breaths were filled with black smoke, a final, quiet moment all his own, facing toward the clear sky above his city. Then a command was shouted, and scores of white-gloved hands flew to hat brims in salute. The coffin was lowered to the avenue and carried by pallbearers up the steps to the cathedral, the silent party greeted by Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan — city and church together for a send-off that, as Lieutenant Davidson’s brother, Eric, observed in his eulogy, would make a passer-by stop and say, “Wow, this guy must be important.” He added, “And still that would be the understatement of the century.” The funeral began even as mourners continued to flow into the massive cathedral, filling every pew and standing in rows in the rear and sides. Cardinal Dolan, in his homily, compared the fallen firefighter to Jesus Christ: “Both we love. Both we thank. One we miss, very much.” “Jesus came to save us from everlasting flames,” he added, “Michael to rescue us from earthly ones.” On Thursday night, Lieutenant Davidson’s company, Engine 69, known as the Harlem Hilton, responded to a call of smoke and flames coming from a basement on St. Nicholas Avenue. The call had come from a film crew working on the upcoming movie “Motherless Brooklyn,” directed by Edward Norton. Lieutenant Davidson, as the nozzle man, was among the first to enter the building and descend to the basement. Thick smoke made seeing anything impossible, and before long the firefighters’ air tanks were signaling they were low. Firefighters followed the hose with their hands to find their way outside, but Lieutenant Davidson lost his grip, got turned around in the smoke and collapsed. He was taken to Harlem Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead early Friday morning. He was posthumously promoted to lieutenant. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Hours before the funeral, contractors began tearing down the Harlem building, at 773 St. Nicholas Avenue, which the city deemed too unstable to stand. The demolition will also allow investigators to begin work in earnest. Lieutenant Davidson left lasting impressions on the streets of Harlem and outside the firehouse, where flowers were stacked hours before the funeral a few miles south. His father, a former firefighter, had also worked at that firehouse. A man and a young girl walked past on Monday. The girl, named Shyla, noticed the flowers. “Those are for the fireman who died,” she said. Her father, Chris Perry, 33, nodded and said, “He’s the one who fixed your bike.” A reporter stopped them and asked to hear the story. Mr. Perry told it — a flat tire last summer, a quick patch in the firehouse — and said, “He was a good guy.” Calvin Hunt, 56, of Harlem, attended the funeral and stood outside. “I’m from Harlem and Lieutenant Davidson was part of Harlem,” said Mr. Hunt, a retired chef who used to frequent the former St. Nick’s Jazz Pub, where the fire broke out. “He stood out,” Mr. Hunt said. “It was his personality, his character. He was full of fun.” The setting of the funeral was far grander than the scene outside the firehouse, but the sentiment was the same. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the lieutenant “a hero of the highest order.” In his eulogy, the mayor directly addressed the fallen firefighter’s four young children and invoked his own father, with whom he had a deeply troubled relationship, but whose military service he would always admire. “I had a dad who wore a uniform and wore it with pride as well,” Mr. de Blasio said. “Your father will be there with you. You’ll know who he was, what he did and what an imprint he left on this earth. That will sustain you.” Daniel A. Nigro, the fire commissioner, drew knowing laughs from the uniformed men and women when he said, “every firefighter wants the nozzle,” and to feel the satisfaction of “facing a fire, pushing it back.” He called Lieutenant Davidson a “natural-born nozzle man” and recalled the lieutenant’s injuries from a fire early in his career. “Mike pulled forward, crawling and inching, room to room,” he said in a eulogy. “He would not stop.” “Mike commanded every situation and led his fellow firefighters into battle,” Commissioner Nigro said. “He wasn’t their captain. He wasn’t their lieutenant. But he was, without question, a leader.” The funeral ended as it began, a stately feat of precision and turnout that froze a stretch of the city’s spine for hours. The coffin was carried back to the fire engine, and up and down the avenue, firefighters in dress blues kept vigil until the rig drove slowly away.",The New York Times
2018,Firefighter Killed in Harlem Blaze Supported Others With Vigor,"When new firefighters arrived at his firehouse in Harlem, Michael Davidson would take it upon himself to supplement their training with advice on how to handle themselves at fires and even how to exercise. When a colleague’s daughter needed help, he organized a fund-raiser. And just a few days ago, after another winter storm, he went around to neighbors’ houses with a snowblower. Mostly, though, his drive to help people came through on the job. He followed his father into the Fire Department, even working in the same firehouse, and he had repeatedly been cited by the department for the bravery he demonstrated and his lifesaving actions. On Thursday night, he responded to a call of a fire tearing through an old jazz club being used as a movie set. He was critically injured and taken to a hospital, where he died. “I only had eight years with him,” his wife, Eileen, said during a tearful interview. “But those eight years, we lived, and we loved. And we fought. But we really lived, because that’s what Michael inspired you to do. And I would take those eight years over 80, living them the way I did with my husband.” Mr. Davidson, 37, was described by fellow firefighters as “strong as an ox” and “just full tilt everything.” Those who knew him said he approached his life outside of firefighting with the same vigor. He and his wife had four children — daughters who are 7, 3 and 1, and a son who is 6 — and she said he would return after working a 24-hour shift and immediately start helping out around the house. (“He was a damn good cook,” she said.) “He was a rock,” said John Hession, who grew up with Mr. Davidson in the Woodside neighborhood of Queens. “As a man, he’s solid,” said Mr. Hession, who called Mr. Davidson his cousin and picked him to be the godfather of his first child. “He’s strong. He was humble. He was always thinking of others. He was very supportive.” His death comes as the department mourned the deaths of two firefighters, Lt. Christopher J. Raguso and Fire Marshal Christopher T. Zanetis, who were among service members killed last week in a United States military helicopter crash during a transport mission in western Iraq. Fire officials said Mr. Davidson, who joined the department in 2003 and was assigned to Engine 69 in Upper Manhattan, was the 1,150th person in the department’s history to be killed on duty. Last year, William Tolley, a 14-year veteran of the department, died from falling from the roof of an apartment building while fighting a fire in Queens, and an emergency medical technician, Yadira Arroyo, was killed when a man stole her ambulance and ran her over in the Bronx. And in 2016, Battalion Chief Michael J. Fahy was killed after being hit by debris in an explosion at a drug house in the Bronx. “Firefighter Davidson bravely battled many fires and responded to countless calls for help from New Yorkers throughout his 15 years of dedicated service,” Daniel A. Nigro, the New York City fire commissioner, said in a statement. “Our department and our entire city mourn this tragic loss of a very brave firefighter.” Mr. Davidson was cited four times for bravery and lifesaving actions, officials said. Last year, he helped resuscitate a woman who had gone into respiratory and cardiac arrest. And in 2005, he was working the nozzle as a fire swept through room after room of a Harlem apartment building, spreading across three floors; he burned his hands but did not retreat. “Some people might back up and start again. Mike didn’t stop,” said Pete Driscoll, a firefighter who had also responded to the call and marveled at the way Mr. Davidson handled himself in many situations. “That was him. Once he got started on something, there was really no stopping. Whether it was a fire or an argument in the kitchen, there was no stopping him.” On Friday, firefighters in plainclothes arrived at the brick firehouse on West 143rd Street where Mr. Davidson was assigned, hugging and patting one another on the shoulders. Police officers delivered food. Jacqueline Harrison was among the people living nearby who brought flowers. “It’s sad, I feel for his family,” Ms. Harrison, a teacher, said. “He’s doing something for us.” Mr. Davidson lived with his family in Floral Park, in Nassau County, in a colonial home with gray siding. His death was discussed in the neighborhood barbershop and at the pizzeria where he would bring his children. The postal worker who delivered his mail recalled how he “always had a kind word to say.” Kim Kerekach, who lives two doors away, said he had shoveled for almost all the houses on the block after Wednesday’s snowstorm. “I was going to go to his house today and say thank you, and then we heard the news very early this morning,” she said. “It’s very sad.” Mr. Davidson enjoyed taking his children to sports practices and fire department events, his wife said. They would play basketball in the driveway, and he recently built a snowman with his children in the yard. “It was always about his kids,” Ms. Davidson said. “I could tell when he had a rough tour, but it was never about him.” Now, his family and other firefighters were grappling with his death. He had been so vital and such a force in their lives — “he had this, like, aura about him,” his brother Eric, who is also a New York City firefighter, said. “He was invincible to me,” said Ken Reilly, who fought fires alongside Mr. Davidson. “I felt invincible because he was there.”",The New York Times
2018,"Firefighter, Journalist and Tourist Among Victims of Helicopter Crash","A video posted on Instagram Sunday night recorded some of their final moments: Young faces, glowing in the pink light of dusk, smiling wide as their sightseeing helicopter lifted off the ground. “In the air!” one of the passengers, Trevor Cadigan, appears to shout over the sound of whirling blades. Only a few minutes later, the chopper descended into the frigid and fast-moving waters of the East River. The pilot, Richard Vance, 33, cried “engine failure” in a mayday call and turned the helicopter away from the busy streets of Manhattan. Of the six people on that flight, Mr. Vance was the only one who survived. Among the dead, the oldest was just 34. Mr. Cadigan, 26, was aboard with Brian McDaniel, also 26, a friend from their high school days in Dallas. Carla Vallejos Blanco, 29, of Corrientes, Argentina, was visiting New York with a friend, a woman who decided to skip the flight. Two other men were killed: Tristan Hill, 29; and Daniel Thompson, 34, whom a law enforcement official described as an employee of the helicopter tour company that operated the craft. Mr. Hill was engaged to be married, according to his younger brother, Brendan. The date was less than two months away. “He always inspired me to be better,” Brendan Hill said. “I was getting ready to write a speech for the wedding, not the eulogy for his funeral.” Tristan Hill was one of three brothers raised in Reno, Nev. He played basketball at Missouri Valley College, and he stayed involved with the sport after graduation. He coached with the Boys and Girls Club of America and organized a charity basketball camp for children in Reno, a fund-raiser for the Boys and Girls Club. Brendan Hill said he was always jealous of his brother’s drive, and Mr. Hill’s short career showed a young man with wide interests and varied talents. He worked at the Sierra Nevada Corporation for a time, and briefly co-owned a bar in Reno called the Stamp Social Club, which was in the basement of an old 1930s post office. He even interned on Capitol Hill for Representative Michael R. Turner, a Republican from Ohio. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Turner said: “Tristan’s personality, intellect, and constant smile were always on display when he worked with us. I was deeply saddened to learn of his passing and my prayers go out to his family. The joy and happiness that he brought to all of us will not be forgotten.” But it was Mr. Hill’s latest venture, his younger brother said, that brought him into the tourist helicopter. He moved to New York a few months ago to work on a sightseeing website called SightSy, where he was the director of operations. One of the activities listed on SightSy is the “Manhattan Sky Tour: New York Helicopter Flight.” Mr. Hill’s other brother, Iain Hill, wrote a tribute to him on Facebook. “The world lost a legend last night,” he wrote. “Few have brought so many together. It is in that vein I post, to help let those people know … It never mattered the schedule, if there was an experience to be lived, or more important a friend in need, he rose to the occasion.” Ms. Vallejos Blanco arrived in New York from Argentina on Wednesday and was planning to stay for a week, said Mateo Estremé, the consul general of Argentina in New York. Roxana Blanco, Ms. Vallejos Blanco’s aunt, told Pulxo, an Argentine radio station, that her niece’s traveling companion decided she would rather skip the Sunday evening ride. “Carlita liked to take pictures and wanted to take pictures from the helicopter, and her friend wanted to do something else,” Ms. Blanco said. “So they agreed to meet at a certain spot later.” Also on the ride was another young person who had recently moved to the city: Mr. Cadigan, the man who took the video. He studied journalism at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and recently moved to New York to work at Business Insider, a business news website. He graduated from Bishop Lynch High School in Dallas in 2010, according to WFAA, a Dallas television station and ABC affiliate, where his father, Jerry Cadigan, is the production manager. “For all of us who had worked in journalism and knew what it took to get out there and get it done, every one of us thought that Trevor had it,” said Tony Pederson, the chairman of the Division of Journalism at Southern Methodist, who taught Mr. Cadigan in a media ethics course. “Teaching Trevor made all of us pretty optimistic about the future of journalism and news media.” Mario Ruiz, a spokesman for Business Insider, said Mr. Cadigan was an intern at the website until a few weeks ago. “He was a smart, talented, and ambitious young journalist and producer who was well-liked and made a big contribution,” Mr. Ruiz said in an email. “Our hearts go out to his family and friends.” Mr. Cadigan was on the helicopter with his friend from high school, Mr. McDaniel. The two were on the football team together and remained friends after they graduated. Mr. McDaniel was a firefighter with the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department and had been on vacation in New York. He was a fire rescue officer assigned to Fire Station 36 in West Dallas, according to a statement from Dallas Fire-Rescue officials. Mr. McDaniel had been with the department since May 2016. Christopher L. Rebuck, the president of Bishop Lynch, said he saw Mr. McDaniel in November when he came by the high school campus to get transcripts. “He was absolutely so proud that he was in a position to be able to serve his community as a fireman,” Mr. Rebuck said. “I could tell that he had really found his place in terms of vocation and what he was meant to do.” Mr. McDaniel’s father, Allen L. McDaniel, said he was too distraught to talk about his son on Monday morning. “I just can’t talk about it right now,” he said. “He’s a great kid, and so was Trevor, his friend that he was with.” His voice caught, and Mr. McDaniel began to cry.",The New York Times
2018,First Lady to Candidate? Chirlane McCray Says ‘I Could Do This’,"Hours before she was to depart for Puerto Rico for a humanitarian mental-health initiative, Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York City, stoked speculation on Tuesday that her future plans included a run for elected office. At times bashful, sincere and carefree, Ms. McCray, appearing at a news conference about her trip, fielded questions on her public role and political future — her most decisive step yet in a subtle but increasingly obvious effort to increase her profile and test the waters for a run for office. “He is very encouraging,” she said when asked if her husband, Mayor Bill de Blasio, supported a run. “But we have not had a specific conversation about any particular office or anything imminent.” Ms. McCray’s comments followed separate interviews with NY1 and The New York Times on Monday, in which she discussed her thinking about becoming a political candidate, all while not quite ruling out mounting a run while her husband is still in office. “As we live and grow, I feel like, my goodness, I am actually capable; I could do this,” she said on Monday. She said that she would not run for mayor and has “no intention, at this moment,” of running for office until Mr. de Blasio leaves City Hall in 2021. She appeared to be considering everything from Brooklyn borough president to public advocate to state representative. “It could be something in Albany, it could be Brooklyn, local, citywide, I don’t know,” she said. “But certainly I would consider it.” She said much the same thing during Tuesday’s news conference. She had not had “formal conversations” with political strategists about a run, laughed off a question about what role Mr. de Blasio would play in her hypothetical life as an elected official — “I don’t think I should answer that question,” she said, smiling — and engaged in lighthearted exchanges with reporters. “I’ll tell you one thing: It’s giving me more practice,” she said of taking questions on subjects other than the one she was there to address: an effort to help with mental health services in Puerto Rico. Indeed, her public profile has grown along with ThriveNYC, the mental health initiative she oversees on behalf of Mayor de Blasio. Backed by a screen reading “New York City Stands With Puerto Rico,” Ms. McCray announced Tuesday that a 12-person team from the city would spend two weeks training school staff on the island to address mental health issues. The nonprofit Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City, which she leads, would also provide a grant of $100,000 for mental health services on the island, a sum matched by the Hispanic Federation. The Mayor’s Fund portion of the money came from donations pledged by city employees for Hurricane Maria relief efforts in Puerto Rico, via automatic payroll deductions, as well as from individual donations through the fund’s website, according to Kate Bernyk, a spokeswoman for Ms. McCray. Ms. McCray was to return to New York early Thursday. The mayor’s office said the flights were paid for by JetBlue and the rest of the trip’s $2,500 cost — for her, Deputy Mayor Herminia Palacio and six staff members — would be borne by the city. (That did not include Ms. McCray’s police detail; City Hall refused to provide the number of officers traveling with her or their cost.) Many New Yorkers have roots and relatives in Puerto Rico and are an important voting bloc in many communities. Asked whether her trip had anything to do with her possible political ambition, Ms. McCray demurred. “Oh my goodness, that is the last thing on my mind,” she said. “It is only natural that we would want to deliver humanitarian resources,” she added. “Seriously, it never, never crossed my mind.”",The New York Times
2018,"First Ray, Then Patsy, Now Joe. Another Pizza War Breaks Out.","Not unlike the city-states of 16th century Europe, the pizza men of New York City have been at war for decades. In the 1980s, three of them, none named Ray, fought an epic battle over the permutations of the Ray’s pizza franchise (Famous Ray’s, Original Ray’s, Famous Original Ray’s) — until they finally joined forces to destroy the other Ray pretenders citywide. Twenty years later, a similar struggle erupted in Manhattan between two Italian restaurants named Patsy’s — a conflict not to be confused with the one in Brooklyn at about the same time between the pizza maker Patsy Grimaldi and the guy he sold his business to. But now, after a period of peace, another war has broken out pitting the proprietors of Famous Joe’s Pizza and Famous Joe’s Pizza of the Village in a trademark case involving accusations of intellectual property theft and the misappropriation of celebrity endorsements. As the claims — and counterclaims — have made their way through Federal District Court in Brooklyn, issues have arisen over sign fonts, Twitter accounts and the crucial question of which pizzeria the actor Tobey Maguire actually likes best. The underlying lawsuit in the skirmish was filed in November, but its roots reach back to August 2004 when Joe Pozzuoli Sr. and his son, Joe Jr., the owners of Famous Joe’s Pizza on Carmine Street in Greenwich Village, fired Victor Zarco, who had worked at their Bleecker Street location since 1989. (It has since been closed.) While the parties disagree on why Mr. Zarco was dismissed, no one disputes what happened next: Touting himself as the Pozzuolis’ former “pizza man,” Mr. Zarco opened a pizzeria on Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn, calling it Famous Joe’s Pizza of the Village, even though his name isn’t Joe and his place was not in Greenwich — or any other — Village. By all accounts — even one from the judge in the case, Brian M. Cogan — the Pozzuolis’ pizzeria is a New York institution. Famous Joe’s Pizza (or “JP,” as their court submissions call it) has been featured in numerous movies and in TV shows like “Law & Order” and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” In 1996, New York Magazine described its pizza as “the quintessential New York slice.” Not to be outdone, Scott’s Pizza Tours later noted in promotional materials that JP’s pizza might be “the greatest slice of pizza in the world.” Famous Joe’s Pizza of the Village (or “JPV”), by contrast, has received reviews that Judge Cogan has called “somewhat tongue-in-cheek.” In 2006, for instance, Time Out New York described JPV’s fare in a less than charitable fashion: It’s good at 2 a.m. when “you’re drunk.” For the first six years that Mr. Zarco’s pizza shop was open, the Pozzuolis were unaware of their copycat in Brooklyn, court papers say. But in 2010, in a kind of sit-down summit, Mr. Pozzuoli Jr. visited his rival and asked him to stop using his family’s trademarked name. Mr. Zarco, however, has a different version of events. He claims that Mr. Pozzuoli Jr. appeared one day, looked around and said, “With you we have no problem. Everything is O.K.” Legally speaking, it was O.K. for another seven years. But according to court papers, that changed in October, when Mr. Zarco put up a sign that was, as Judge Cogan said, “nearly indistinguishable” from the one JP had been using since 1983. Was it really mere coincidence, the Pozzuolis asked, that Mr. Zarco had availed himself of the exact same design — the one with “Joe’s” in a red, slanting script and “PIZZA” in block text set against a solid wash of white? Mr. Pozzuoli Jr. sent Mr. Zarco a cease-and-desist letter when he learned about the sign. Mr. Zarco changed it, but only slightly — straightening the “Joe’s.” The lawsuit quickly followed. In January, Judge Cogan issued an opinion enjoining JPV from using the duplicative design, saying that Mr. Zarco’s version of events struck him as “dubious.” Judge Cogan found that the sign was an attempt “to create the impression among customers and potential customers” that the two pizzerias were “associated.” In his opinion, the judge said that more than the logo had been stolen. Mr. Zarco, he explained, had adorned the walls of JPV with photographs of Mr. Maguire and others that had actually been taken at the Manhattan pizzeria; he had also posted images on JPV’s social-media accounts of “Spider-Man 2” — Mr. Maguire’s hit movie — being filmed at JP. You might have thought that all this evidence, in a federal judge’s order, would have ended the fight. But as in other conflicts, a cease-fire in a pizza war isn’t easily achieved. Within three weeks of the order being issued, the Pozzuolis had already accused Mr. Zarco of ignoring it. In a letter to Judge Cogan, the Pozzuolis claimed that while their rival’s sign had indeed changed — barely — his Twitter page was still using their logo, which had also appeared on Mr. Zarco’s GrubHub account. They further said that JPV had borrowed the one-of-a-kind “soccer dog logo” they had briefly used to promote their pies during the World Cup. As for the photograph of Mr. Maguire, it had not been taken down, they claimed. In fact, it was “enlarged.” Three days later, Mr. Zarco wrote his own note to the judge saying that he had just fixed his Twitter page and that GrubHub had “migrated all the information” from another food website without his knowledge. He said the Pozzuolis’ accusation that his photo collection had changed “for the worse” was patently false. Then in a follow-up note, he took a subtle swipe at his former bosses, complaining that their pizzeria’s “name is as generic as the pizza they serve.” Mr. Zarco’s lawyer, William Hochberg, said his client was not “looking for trouble, but he won’t be trampled on” by the Pozzuolis' “zealous pizza lawyers.” “We hope to reach a truce that makes sense for all,” Mr. Hochberg said, “especially the pizza-loving customers.” At lunch on Friday, there was little sign at either pizzeria that a bitter battle was raging in the courts. Inside JPV, a few students from William Alexander Middle School sat at a booth plucking strings of gooey cheese from their slices and washing them down with soft drinks. Across the river at JP, an older clientele stood at a counter at the rain-smeared window, savoring their crusts, blackened lightly with a char. The air of normalcy led one to wonder how pizza wars get started in the first place. This was a question that the younger Mr. Pozzuoli has thought about for years. “Pizza is so commonplace these days that I guess when you have a standout product, others try to mimic it,” he said. “It’s no surprise to us. People are passionate about pizza.”",The New York Times
2018,"First Try the Pastrami, Then the Polyamory","Modern Love Over pastrami sandwiches, my new boyfriend said to me: “One of my ex-lovers is going to be at the conference I’m attending next week. We’ll be sharing a room and sleeping together.” I blinked away tears. “I never wanted to know that,” I said, wishing I had stayed home instead of making the 90-minute train trip to see him. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I was just being honest.” My guy was an Ivy League-educated doctor with an M.B.A., but he no longer practiced medicine or worked in business. Instead, he was training to become a tantric sex instructor while working on his songwriting. His name was Howard. He was polyamorous. I was a widow of four years after being with my high school sweetheart, George, for 32. I had dived into the cesspool of online dating looking for love, but my manic dog paddling hadn’t produced that. For now, I was settling for weird. Howard was sweet, smart and honest to several faults. I liked him, but I also saw him as an experiment. If I couldn’t find Mr. Right, what about Mr. Quasi-Right augmented by a few others? We had been together for only a couple of months, spending Saturday nights together with an occasional weeknight thrown in. I suspected his other nights were reserved for other women, but I didn’t want to know. We lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, 13 train stops apart — I in Danville, a placid East Bay suburb, and he in the bustling Mission district. Worse, we were far apart in what we wanted. We were both culturally Jewish but our versions were different. Even though my family wasn’t religious, my upbringing had been prudish. I couldn’t see even cultural Jewishness coexisting with polyamory. The idea of having a beloved, or “beshert” (an idealistic word I had stopped using after my husband died), seemed so ingrained to being Jewish. Howard wanted to move beyond the monogamous model he had been raised with; I wanted to replicate it. Not surprisingly, I didn’t want to move to San Francisco and he couldn’t see himself living in Danville. We were both still active online, seeing other people. When Howard told me about his conference, I said, “I should be honest, too. I’ll be going on a couple of first dates while you’re gone.” But the prospect of a tentative first kiss couldn’t compete with his announcement that he would be spending multiple nights with someone else. During the week of the conference, I kept picturing him in bed with some faceless woman, a gold chain sparkling around her slender waist. Their imaginary sex was both tender and incendiary, fueled by shared pasts, synchronized breathing and enviable muscle control. He had told me he wanted a primary partner, someone to live with and plan a future together. But there were caveats. “What does it mean for you to be polyamorous and in a relationship?” I said a couple of weeks later, sitting in his sunken living room with views of the bay, reminding myself I probably shouldn’t get too comfortable there. “Along with having a primary partner,” he said, “I need to have a few nights with some former lovers, plus one fling a year.” “Why must keeping up with old lovers involve sleeping together?” I said. “Couldn’t you just meet for lunch?” “I’ve been poly for seven years,” he said. “I can love more than one person at a time. Part of being poly is being able to realize your full potential.” “But why is your potential tied up with sex?” I said. “It’s the difference between taking a pottery class because you want to try pottery and needing to sleep with the pottery teacher.” With all of those lovers and flings, life with Howard looked like being a housekeeper with benefits. We would be maintaining a partnership so that we could give the best of ourselves to other people. An introvert, I wanted to fall in love with one person so I could stop flinging myself around. I wanted to stay home with true love and plenty of time to read. What is seeking a fling when you’re in a committed relationship if not the need to feed your ego with fresh meat? I asked Howard if he minded that I sometimes slept with my ex-boyfriend, a spiky-haired, green-eyed guitarist. “No, I’m good with it,” he said. “It’s easier if we both want to spend time with old lovers.” But my ex-boyfriend couldn’t deal with Howard, so I ended my attempt at ex-lover polyamory. Howard called polyamory “consensual non-monogamy,” meaning you could have sex with other people so long as all parties agreed. It involved a lot of mature, evolved discussion about setting parameters. I’m a former lawyer. This sounded like drafting a settlement agreement. And if we couldn’t agree to the terms, would Howard mope around the house moaning that I never let him do anything fun? I called polyamory “exposure to disease.” Even in your primary relationship you always would have to practice safe sex, because your partner was seeing other people. And it always would be emotionally dangerous because he may come to like one of those people more than he liked you. If we both loved other people, wouldn’t we want to spend our time with them? It sounded like a recipe for disaster. You could fall in love with your fling. As early as 2009, Newsweek asked whether polyamory was the next sexual revolution. But back then it wasn’t on my radar because I had George. Polyamory has been classified as both a sexual orientation and a lifestyle choice. It seems some people are wired to be in simultaneous relationships and aren’t jealous when their partners are too. But many of the questions on sites providing advice about polyamory are from secondary partners who are jealous of their lover’s primary relationship. “When I’m committed to someone,” I said to Howard, “I don’t want to see other people. And I don’t want to hear that you do.” In my post-George dating years, I had developed a protective shell over my heart. Allowing myself to love again would mean letting that shell crack and fall away, not maintaining it because my partner invited strangers to trample through our relationship. The whole thing seemed so avoidable. At some point, we would have to agree to become exclusive. If either of us were attracted to someone else, we would suffer our lust in silence like decent people. Then there was my own weakness. If I settled for a man who slept with other people, I would be tempted to do it, too, if for no other reason than to quell my insecurity that I wasn’t enough. We could both return home the next morning with smiles on our faces. But I wouldn’t be smiling; I’d be in pain. Howard used the word “and” to replace “but” in conversation. He said “but” indicated an either/or situation, whereas “and” suggested coexistence. When I first met him, I tried using “and” too, hoping to see more possibilities. “I want to fall in love and still sleep around.” “I want to fall in love but still sleep around.” Over time I returned to “but,” seeing only a linguistic conceit. When I first met Howard, I had wanted to be open to a different kind of life than when I was married, one that wasn’t necessarily monogamous. But that’s not me. Maybe I was limiting myself by being so traditional. Or maybe I was finding myself, because years after losing George I was again open to love. I just needed to stop sleeping with my ex-boyfriend and dating men with no long-term potential. “Stop wasting your love energy on guys you have no future with,” one of my girlfriends said, quoting her therapist. But she too was still online looking for Mr. Forever while sleeping with Mr. Temporary as a palliative. “You’re my fling,” I told Howard. “Eventually I’ll meet someone like me and this will end.” A month later I did meet someone like me, another culturally Jewish lawyer who lived in the suburbs. We even had attended the same synagogue. We agreed that making love meant that we wouldn’t see other people. But neither of us wanted to see other people anyway now that we had found each other. Ending my relationship with Howard wasn’t hard. It wasn’t even bittersweet. It was more like walking out of a really good movie. I knew it was going to end. I could relate to the characters, but I couldn’t be any of them. Howard’s version of polyamory, for all of its openness, was too constrained. He’d had all those years of accumulating experiences, but I’d had George. And I knew that when you find love, you jump in, almost involuntarily. You don’t sit on the edge negotiating how to keep your options open.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | First-World Problem: Student Parking in an Affluent Suburb,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Still Circling for a Spot” (news article, March 10): I teach English as a second language at Great Neck North High School, the focus of your article about a planned expansion of a parking lot for students. While many high schools in well-off communities see an increase in students’ cars that are fancier than teachers’ cars, these communities are also experiencing an increase in students at the other end of the economic spectrum. Those students take the bus or walk to school. Why? Some do not have cars and/or have not been able to pay for driver education classes; others share a car with family members. It’s time to look holistically at affluent suburbs, realize that each one has pockets of have-nots and ensure that the media bring attention to everyone’s challenges. Some students face issues far worse than finding a parking spot. PS: I park my 2007 Honda in the faculty lot! SUSANNE MARCUSGREAT NECK, N.Y. To the Editor: Your article doesn’t address the two-ton Mercedes in the room: Why are 17-year-olds being given luxury cars as birthday presents? As the parent of two teenagers, I am not immune to the pressures facing families surrounded by status symbols of wealth and privilege. But the sense of entitlement the high school is accommodating by spending public money to construct a parking lot that resembles “a luxury dealership” reflects an encouragement of conspicuous consumption that should be antithetical to the school’s mission as an educational institution. It’s one thing for parents to lavish adult toys on their teenagers; it’s another for their schools to celebrate that behavior. Perhaps the school’s concern should be focused on a problem more pervasive than a shortage of parking spaces. JON REINER, NEW YORK To the Editor: I cringed as I read the article about the dearth of parking spaces for high school students at elite public suburban high schools.

2018,Fitness in Midlife May Help Fend Off Dementia,"Being physically fit in midlife may reduce a woman’s risk for dementia. In 1968, Swedish researchers evaluated the cardiovascular fitness of 191 women ages 38 to 60, testing their endurance with an ergometer cycling test. Then they examined them periodically through 2012. Over the years, 44 women developed dementia. They categorized the women into three fitness groups based on peak workload in their cycling tests: low, medium and high. The incidence of all-cause dementia was 32 percent in the low fitness group, 25 percent for the medium, and 5 percent among those with a high fitness level. The average age at dementia was 11 years older in the high-fitness group than in the medium fitness group. Compared with medium fitness, high fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88 percent. The study, in Neurology, controlled for many variables, including smoking, drinking, blood pressure and cholesterol, and the follow-up was very long. But the sample was small and the study is observational, and the authors draw no conclusions about cause and effect. Still, the senior author, Dr. Ingmar Skoog, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Gothenburg, said that women should get moving for many reasons. “If you start exercising,” he said, “you reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer and dementia. And you get immediate gratification by feeling better.”",The New York Times
2018,Fitting Growing Kids Into Small Spaces,"Right at Home Despite their diminutive size, children occupy a considerable amount of space, particularly if you live in a small New York City apartment. The jigsaw puzzle that becomes your home grows only more complicated with each additional child. If you house siblings together in a shared bedroom, you find yourself constantly reinventing the space to make room for more stuff and larger people — out go the toddler beds, in come the bunks. As the children grow, you wonder what will happen when they, say, need a desk. Or worse, what happens if they should want a room of their own? “It’s a real evolution. You get an apartment and you get your head stuck in how things should be,” said Jessica Vitkus, 51, who lives with her boyfriend, Stephen Murello, 54, and her twin 4-year-old daughters in a two-bedroom condo in the Christodora House in the East Village. “Once you have kids, you really have to open up your mind about how to use space and where you put people.” When they were first born, Sadie and Matilda Vitkus slept in the master bedroom with their mother, Ms. Vitkus, a TV producer. But then, when the twins were about 10 months old, Ms. Vitkus began dating Mr. Murello, a director of photography for TV. The girls were soon shunted to the second bedroom, which had been “my groovy entertaining den and guest room,” Ms. Vitkus said. “But those days are over.” Now, with their fifth birthdays looming, Sadie and Matilda have outgrown their snug toddler beds. They offer not-so-subtle hints, saying things like, “Mama, I don’t fit,” Ms. Vitkus said. “I say, ‘Curl up and be cozy. Be like a little bug.’ I try to spin it into a positive, but I know that I’m on borrowed time.” Soon, Ms. Vitkus will have to figure out how to wedge two twin-size beds into the tiny room. Bunk beds would make the most sense, but who really wants bunk beds? They’re tall, towering and no fun for cuddling. Fights over who gets the top bunk are inevitable until, eventually, the kids outgrow the arrangement. At that point, stuck with an oversize and obsolete piece of furniture, you have to reorganize the room all over again. Reorganizing is just code for purging. “The best thing to maximize your space is to organize and declutter,” said Shalena Smith, the owner of Gaga Designs, a Los Angeles interior design firm for children’s spaces. Ms. Smith often encounters unnecessary chaos in the homes of her clients. “Literally, I walk in there and am like, ‘Do you still use this? No. Does your kid still play with this? No.’ A lot of things can leave your room.” Clear out the excess, the theory goes, and newfound space will materialize. But space has limits, even if you acquire more of it. After living in cramped apartments with toddlers in Brooklyn and later New Jersey, my family stretched out to a house in the suburbs in 2013. With all that endless square footage, I snatched one of the three bedrooms for my office, since I work from home. My husband and I tucked the kids into the third bedroom, and they were happy little peas, chattering away at night, and decorating their walls with their finger-painted projects. I figured I had years until they were old enough to notice that my serene office with two windows was actually a bedroom that one of them could occupy. When that time came, I’d relocate. To where, you might ask? I hadn’t given that issue much thought. But now that the kids are 7 and 10, I can feel the day of reckoning upon me — they greedily eye my airy room, arguing about who will get it. My daughter has grand visions for a canopy bed and a night table with a butterfly lamp. My son simply wants his younger sister’s night light to go away. But here’s the monkey wrench to their plans: I do not want to be banished to the basement, the natural resting place for all things that have no place to go. So we have come to another phase of the endless reshuffling equation: Does the space we have still work? Or is it time for an upheaval? After all, children all over the world and for most of time have shared rooms with each other, and often their parents, too. “This idea that everybody gets their own bedroom is a very new idea in history if you think about it,” said James J. Crist, who wrote “Siblings: You’re Stuck With Each Other, So Stick Together” with Elizabeth Verdick. The United States census does not track how many children share bedrooms, nor does New York City. However, the 2014 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey found that only 26 percent of the city’s apartments had three or more bedrooms. With most New Yorkers living in smaller apartments, children clearly double up. The same survey also found that 8 percent of households with children under 18 were considered crowded, with more than two people per bedroom. But still, if there’s an alternative to sharing, you start to wonder if you should indulge it. Experts, surprisingly, say maybe not. “When kids share a space, there is going to be conflict, but that is not something that we have to seek to avoid,” said Joanna Faber, who, with Julie King, wrote “How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen.” “Leaving aside all the wonderful things about sharing a room, of which I think there are a mountain, conflict is an opportunity to practice skills.” In other words, the bickering is good and so are all those late-night bedside chats. But children’s needs change as they grow, even if the size of their room does not. Older children need desks for homework and privacy. The older one might need to study late, while the younger one still wakes early. To solve these problems, Ms. Smith suggested sacrificing the dressers to reclaim square footage for a desk. Get beds with built-in drawers, she said, or reconfigure the closet to fit shelves. As for privacy, how about an Ikea curtain room divider — kind of like a hospital curtain, but for your bedroom. A change in perspective also helps. “It’s not that they have to share a room, but they get to share a room,” Ms. Smith said. That settled it for me: I’m staying put, although some bedroom redecorating may be in our near future. New Yorkers have a knack for making it work. Sky Khan, a writer whose Instagram page chronicles the adventures of a family of six living in the city, said her four children “are literally packed in like sardines” in the family’s two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea. Ms. Khan and her husband, Ben Flammang, who are both in their 40s, sleep-trained their children in a closet. Now, the three younger ones — Kiki, 7, Sander, 6, and Quinn, 1 — are tucked into a bedroom in the back. Quinn sleeps in what Ms. Khan describes as a Montessori tent, while Kiki and Sander share a tri-level bunk bed built by Mr. Flammang, who works in business development. “They love it,” Ms. Khan said. “It’s like a sleepover every night.” As a 10th birthday present, Nash, the oldest, graduated to a windowless room, which Mr. Flammang constructed by adding temporary walls to the hallway. Nash’s recent move gave his siblings new ideas about space, even if no more exists. “The 6-year-old just put two and two together a few days ago,” Ms. Khan said, and asked for his own room. Ms. Khan dodged the request, reminding him that his older sister is next in line. As for now, “We’re just kind of winging it,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Five Destinations That Call for Caution,"Update A recent report finds that visiting cities like Karachi, Pakistan, and Caracas, Venezuela, can be risky for travelers. Staying safe while traveling is a topic which continues to be relevant as terrorist attacks are no longer a surprise and mass shootings seem to be increasingly common. Is almost every destination in the world a potential danger? In fact, according to the latest Safe Cities Index, some places pose considerably more risk than others. The report was released late last year by The Economist Intelligence Unit, the research and analysis division of The Economist Group, a London-based company that specializes in international business. The index ranked the safety of 60 international cities across four categories, including personal security, which scored each city on factors such as the number of terrorist attacks, crime rates, threat of military conflict and threat of civil unrest. The Safe Cities Index was first published in 2015, and the not-so-good news in the second version released in 2017 is that levels of personal security appear to have declined in the past two years, said Christopher Clague, a managing editor at The Economist Intelligence Unit and the creator of the index. Below, according to the Safe Cities Index, are the five most dangerous destinations in the world right now. Karachi, Pakistan The port city of Karachi has ongoing security issues, including ethnic, political and sectarian violence, a high crime rate and terrorism, said Matthew Bradley, the regional director of security for International SOS, a travel risk management company. “Karachi is not a city where you should go unless you absolutely have to,” he said. Greg Boles, an associate managing director for Kroll, a security consulting company, said that Karachi is subject to a high number of terrorist attacks from both foreign and indigenous terrorist groups, including the Pakistani Taliban. “U. S. citizens are a target in Karachi and can get kidnapped for ransom,” he said. Mr. Boles also said that because Pakistan borders Afghanistan, the Taliban and its well-established networks can transport United States citizens from Pakistan to that country. Caracas, Venezuela Venezuela’s capital is unsafe when it comes to personal security, Mr. Bradley said, because of the prevalence of violent crime and frequency of sexual assaults on women. “Crime is endemic, and opportunistic street crime and more serious offenses such as kidnapping, carjacking and armed robbery have become increasingly common,” he said. Mr. Boles, who has previously worked in Caracas, said that the city has a food and medicine shortage, which causes social unrest and protests. “The general population doesn’t have access to basic necessities and can act out in frustration,” he said. “If you’re visiting, you can easily become a part of the mess and may be detained without access to clean water or food.” Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam It may seem surprising to see this French colonial metropolis, formerly known as Saigon and popular with tourists, ranked among the top five dangerous destinations, but Mr. Boles said that crime is an issue there, including violent, organized and petty offenses. Ho Chi Minh City’s dense population makes active policing a challenge, and because bicycles and scooters are a common mode of transportation, perpetrators can quickly flee. Mr. Bradley said that visitors, particularly when in tourist areas such as those around Pham Ngu Lao and Dong Khoi, shouldn’t display any valuable items like jewelry or cellphones, or walk alone after dark. Additionally, they should be aware that drinks and food may be drugged. Yangon, Myanmar The tension between Myanmar’s Muslim and Buddhist communities makes Yangon an unsafe place to be, said Mr. Boles. “The fighting between the two ethnic groups can be violent and unpredictable,” he said. “From a tourist perspective, it’s an unstable city because you don’t know what’s going to happen next.” Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, has been subject to serious human rights abuses, including murder and rape, according to international human right groups like Amnesty International. Quito, Ecuador Yes, it’s a tourist destination, but crime, including pickpocketing, robbery and thefts in hotel rooms, is a significant concern, according to both Mr. Bradley and Mr. Boles. Mr. Boles said that tourists have been robbed when they’re out and about in the city while Mr. Bradley said that Quito has a problem with what are known as “express” kidnappings. “Travelers perceived to be wealthy have been seized and forced to withdraw large sums of money from their A.T.M. accounts,” he said. “While most express kidnappings end in the release of the abductee, in some cases, they have resulted in the death of the targeted individual.” The State Department’s site says that “crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador” and also warns of express kidnappings.",The New York Times
2018,Five Important Takeaways From China’s National People’s Congress,"BEIJING — The annual meeting of China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress, is usually a sleepy, stolid affair. But this year history happened. In the 16-day session that ended on Tuesday, the Communist Party-controlled congress approved changes that could shape China for decades, especially by stretching President Xi Jinping’s hold on power far into the future. Here are some highlights of our coverage. Just over a week before the congress started on March 5, the Communist Party dropped a bombshell: that lawmakers would vote on a constitutional amendment lifting a two-term limit on the presidency. Mr. Xi pushed the change through with a speed and secrecy striking even for China. Read: China Moves to Let Xi Stay in Power by Abolishing Term Limit Read: How Xi Jinping Made His Power Grab: With Stealth, Speed and Guile Abolishing term limits showed that Mr. Xi wants to stay in power, unrivaled, far past the decade that his predecessor held office. The political maneuvering confirmed his status as a party titan likened, by some, to Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Others see parallels with Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other modern-day authoritarians. Read: With Xi’s Power Grab, China Joins New Era of Strongmen Read: President Xi’s Strongman Rule Raises New Fears of Hostility and Repression Chinese reaction to abolition of Mr. Xi’s term limit has varied. But all public opinion, pro and con, has been censored — even Winnie the Pooh has fallen under the censors’ net — and proceedings at the legislature were carefully scripted. Still, the melodramatic eye roll of a journalist at a staid news conference upset the stagecraft and flooded the Chinese internet with sly humor.

Lawmakers also approved a new investigative agency that will entrench Mr. Xi’s anticorruption drive.

2018,Five Places to Go in Chicago,"5 PLACES Chicago’s storied Uptown neighborhood has emerged from a decades-long slump with new restaurants and cultural centers. For decades, Uptown, one of Chicago’s most storied neighborhoods, struggled to regain its early-to-mid-century luster when jazz and swing musicians dominated the music scene and ornate movie halls catered to robust crowds. Despite being well-served by the El, Chicago’s train system, and having a coveted Lake Michigan shoreline, the neighborhood slumped as crime rose and its aging housing stock fell into disrepair. Lately, though, Uptown’s new cultural centers and restaurants have fueled a creative spirit in this highly-diverse neighborhood. While debates over affordable housing and development remain huge issues in the area, Uptown is ready again for its close-up. This cozy coffee shop is the centerpiece of Wilson Abbey, a neighborhood hub that hosts concerts, conferences and other special events.

After creative types moved into the area, trendy restaurants, galleries, distilleries and other business have followed. There’s a spark of energy that shows no sign of slowing down in Nashville’s Wedgewood- Houston neighborhood. Situated a few blocks south of the city’s downtown, the area was long a run-down part of town with warehouses, factories and garages. Today, artists, musicians and other creative types are moving into shiny modern condominiums and homes. Just as local real estate developers have been attracted by the inexpensive land and prime location, entrepreneurs have been lured in for these same reasons, too, and are opening restaurants, distilleries, art galleries and other businesses that draw crowds from all over town.

2018,Five Places to Shop in Belfast,"5 places Belfast’s lively city center is a compact pedestrian-friendly area where the shopping gems are independently owned establishments. When locals in Belfast, in Northern Ireland, want to go shopping, they head to the lively city center, a compact pedestrian friendly area with modern buildings and stately structures from mostly the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Although there are international retail chains such as Zara and H&M, the neighborhood’s gems are the independently owned establishments. Visitors can discover these shops selling goods from the United Kingdom and Irish brands as they stroll along the wide lanes and often charming side streets. The owner of this more than two decade-old tiny jewelry store, Sean Harden, named it after his niece and sources his pieces — which are made mostly of semiprecious materials — from United Kingdom designers. He favors an aesthetic that’s simple yet chic such as a trio of sterling silver bangles and a rose gold plated ring with a swirl pattern. And for men, there are cuff links, rings, bracelets and necklaces, too. Prices from 10 pounds (about $14). 10 Queen’s Arcade; laurenmayonline.com Although the merchandise in this quarter-century-old women’s clothing store, which carries pieces from United Kingdom designers, includes vintage-inspired pants, skirts and T-shirts, the large and diverse selection of dresses is impressive.

2018,Five Things I Learned on My Quebec Road Trip: The Canada Letter,"Hi! It’s Dan Bilefsky. It’s been a frenetic 11 days on my road trip through Quebec. I ended the trip in proud and scenic Saguenay, an important center for forestry and aluminum, and am now returning home to Montreal. Images from the journey have stayed in my mind. Muslim worshipers kneeling on the floor in a Quebec City mosque pocked with bullet holes from an attack over a year ago. Revelers dancing Sunday at midnight at a Quebec City bistro. The Indigenous radio DJ in Maniwaki who affirms his identity by proclaiming one Algonquin word a day on the radio. The Quebec flags fluttering in Hérouxville, the sleepy village that introduced a code of conduct reminding immigrants not to stone women. I undertook my travels to learn more about the province, where I grew up and recently returned after 28 years away. It was a fun adventure, guided by your suggestions. Here are five things I learned: 1. Everyone in Quebec is a minority. English speakers feel like a minority in the province because they are surrounded by a French majority. The French feel like a minority because they are surrounded by English speakers in the rest of Canada. Immigrant groups, whether Jews or Muslims or Sikhs, feel like a minority in a province where secularism is ingrained culturally because of the historic revolution against the influence of the Catholic Church in the 1960s. “We are all minorities in Quebec,” the detective novelist Louise Penny told me. “It creates a frisson” in everyday life. 2. Quebecers sometimes act like British people who speak French. The French influence in the province is omnipresent in the language, the architecture, the exquisite bread and cheese. But the influence of British colonialism is still strong, especially when it comes to the Quebec kitchen, with its meat pies, or tourtières, and poutine, the artery-hardening hangover cure. At the same time, there is a seeming cultural propensity for politeness that reminds me of Britain, my previous home. This bifurcated cultural swagger makes Quebec unique in Canada and, as a former resident of London and Paris, I sometimes feel transported back to those places without having to hop on a plane. 3. Fear and loathing of Trump. From multicultural Montreal to Quebec’s manufacturing regions, Quebecers expressed bemusement and concern about President Trump’s America. In Saguenay, factory owners and workers told me they had lost sleep over fear that Mr. Trump would impose tariffs on Canadian exports like paper products or aluminum, and undermine their businesses and livelihoods. At a sprawling aluminum factory in Chicoutimi, which supplies aluminum to American car companies, workers warned that American consumers would suffer in the event of a trade war. “We just can’t afford for that to happen,” one told me. 4. Separatism is sputtering. As I traveled across the province, many Quebecers, with rare exceptions, told me they were no longer consumed by the quest for independence or the cultural battles of the past. This was particularly pronounced among the younger generation. In Quebec City, a large group of teenagers at St. Charles Garnier College told me they saw their future in a globalized Quebec that is firmly a part of Canada. In Montreal, young people seemed more intent on finding the hippest cafe than whether they needed to order a coffee in the language of Shakespeare or Voltaire. Yet there were notable exceptions, including in industrial Saguenay where the desire for national self-determination remains strong. “Our generation is facing the broken dream that independence isn’t going to happen any time soon,” said Gérard Bouchard, a leading intellectual. 5. Bigger is better. When I was devouring a three-layered almond foie gras cake at Martin Picard’s Cabane à Sucre au Pied de Cochon, it occurred to me that minimalism would not be on the menu during my Quebec road trip. That was only the first course and 12 courses followed, cementing that view. (To make room in our stomachs, a waitress brought periodic shots of cognac and maple syrup delivered in a tube.) This convivial excess became a leitmotif of the trip, and seems to reflect a culture marinated in French joie de vivre and a North American reverence for supersized everything. It also comes down to a Quebec spirit of hospitality and mischievous fun. Next week, I return the newsletter to Ian Austen. Thanks for reading. If you missed any part of the road trip, catch up on my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts, as well as on The Times’s Reader Center. And please be sure to let us know your reactions to the road trip and give us any other suggestions you have on our Canada coverage. —Perhaps the most famous backyard rink in Canada was the one Walter Gretzky used to make in Brantford, Ontario, for his son Wayne.

2018,Five Tips for a Luxury Paris Getaway on a Budget,"Travel Tips The City of Lights is known as a pricey place to vacation, but with these tips you can stretch your dollars and still enjoy the finer things Paris has to offer. Whether it’s a hotel stay, shopping or dining out, a vacation to Paris can be a pricey proposition, especially if you’ve got your sights set on an upscale trip. But there are plenty of ways to stretch your dollar in the City of Lights and have a high-end getaway. Barkley Hickcox, a Paris specialist and an owner of Local Foreigner, has a few tips to help travelers make the most of their Parisian getaway. The ideal time to visit Paris is between November and April, when hotel prices are at their lowest. Some high-end properties offer even further discounts if you book a stay several months in advance. Ms. Hickcox is a fan of visiting during the first half of December, when the city is decorated with holiday lights and particularly beautiful. If you prefer warmer weather, April can be a mild and sunny month to visit. But if you’re on a budget, avoid going in June and September because hotel rates are at their peak. Families traveling to Paris should consider staying in a high-end apartment instead of a hotel, Ms. Hickcox said. “An apartment is less expensive than booking multiple rooms at a five-star hotel, and since you have a kitchen, you can save money on food costs by eating in occasionally,” she said. Companies like OneFineStay, Paris Perfect and Paris Attitude have a range of luxury apartment listings in Paris. If you prefer a hotel, choose boutique properties in non-touristy neighborhoods. The Hoxton, in the Second Arrondissement, for example, is a former residence dating back to the 18th century and has chic accommodations at reasonable prices. Another option is Le Saint Hotel a Paris, in the heart of Saint-Germain. Paris is known for fine cuisine, but rather than dining at one of the city’s renowned restaurants at dinnertime, go for lunch, when the tab will be much lower and the cuisine just as good. Several popular eateries offer affordable midday prix fixe menus. Frenchie, for example, has a four-course, seasonally-driven menu for 45 euros (about $56) while the four-course lunch menu at Septime, another seasonal spot, is 42 euros. For dinner, Ms. Hickcox recommended going to restaurants in residential neighborhoods such as South Pigalle, the Haut Marais and Montmartre. “You’ll find lots of great eateries where you can have dinner with wine for 35 to 50 euros a person,” she said. One of Ms. Hickcox’s top resources to find off-the-beaten path restaurants is the blog Paris by Mouth. Ms. Hickcox’s favorite way to explore Paris is on foot. “You can fully appreciate the city’s beauty by walking, and it’s designed for walkers because there are walking paths and sidewalks everywhere,” she said. For longer distances, she suggested using the city’s bike share system, Velib. A weeklong pass costs 15 euros, and there are stations everywhere. Or, try the Metro, Paris’ subway system. It’s convenient, and you can buy daily and weekly passes. While Paris has no shortage of big-name designer stores, the city’s flea markets are full of unusual and far more affordable finds. Marche aux Puces St Ouen, for instance, sells vintage furniture, vintage designer jewelry and handbags as well as old books, maps and other knickknacks. Ms. Hickcox also likes Marche aux Puces de la Porte de Vanves, a smaller, more manageable version of St Ouen.",The New York Times

2018,Floating Heritage Tour Celebrates Glass and the Erie Canal,"Barges laden with furnaces, pots, blowpipes and molds traveled along the Hudson River and through the Erie Canal in 1868 to move Corning Glass Works from Brooklyn to Corning, N.Y. This spring, GlassBarge, a modern-day floating glassblowing studio, will take a similar trip to commemorate both the 150th anniversary of glassmaking in Corning and the bicentennial of the Erie Canal. “It’s retracing a journey,” said Robert Cassetti, the senior director for creative strategy and visitor engagement at the Corning Museum of Glass, which is organizing the barge’s four-month tour beginning in mid-May. “It’s an opportunity to bring the experience of live glassmaking and the heritage of Corning all across the state, and to celebrate the beauty and importance of New York waterways.” GlassBarge will launch from Brooklyn Bridge Park — a stone’s throw from the original Brooklyn Flint Glass Company (now Corning Inc.) — and stop at dozens of waterfront communities to give free demonstrations. (The final leg from Watkins Glen to Corning, a distance of about 20 miles, will be by land; the canal section along the original route is no longer functional.) “When people see a glob of molten glass for the first time, their eyes are wide open,” said Eric Meek, a gaffer and senior manager for hot glass programs at the Corning museum. “People get captivated by it.” A narrator will describe the process in detail and explain how the ancient art of making glass remains relevant. “We take a simple, humble material, shape it with techniques and ideas from creative minds,” and make objects we use every day, said Mr. Meek, who has been blowing glass for 25 years. “We talk about the value of the process of making something by hand, which is mysterious to people today. When onlookers watch something being made by highly skilled craftsmen, it helps them form a deeper appreciation of the objects in their world.” A narrator will also tell Corning’s story: how the company relocated to take advantage of cheaper, more accessible raw materials and convenient access to waterways and railroads; and how the town came to be known as Crystal City for the company’s cut and engraved glass. Glassmaking in Corning — with contributions from glassmakers, researchers and scientists — “has led to innovations that have changed the world,” Mr. Meek said. They include Thomas Edison’s first successful light bulb, the Pyrex measuring cup, the screen for Apple’s first iPhone and optical fiber for telecommunications. The Corning museum’s home base highlights more than 35 centuries of glass artistry, science and technological breakthroughs, and interactive experiences, including make-your-own-glass workshops. In port cities along GlassBarge’s route, nearby museums and institutions will contribute programming that depicts life along the Erie Canal in the 19th century. “Every town has a canal story” that sheds light on local history, Mr. Meek said. The Erie Canal broke ground in 1817 and was fully operational by 1825. “It was the first direct connection between the Atlantic and the Great Lakes and opened up westward expansion,” said Brian U. Stratton, director of the New York State Canal Corporation, which runs a system stretching more than 500 miles. “The cost for shipping goods went from about $90 to $5 virtually overnight.” The canal’s importance as a commercial waterway cannot be overstated, said Capt. Jonathan Boulware, executive director of the South Street Seaport Museum. “The entire region would not be what it is today without the Erie Canal,” he said. “It allowed the Port of New York to connect to the heartland and to become the busiest port in the world, which resulted in modern New York as we know it. “The city that never sleeps, the cultural mecca, the financial capital, all flowed directly from this connection.,” he added. GlassBarge will be towed by the W. O. Decker, the last New York-built wooden steam tugboat — part of the seaport museum’s fleet. Planned events on the Decker, which has been refit with diesel engines, include stories about tugboats as working vessels. It will also offer free rides. The Lois McClure, a replica of an 1862 sailing canal boat, part of the permanent collection of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, will also be part of the flotilla. When it enters open water, Mr. Stratton said, “it turns into a sailing vessel, with huge, majestic sails.” The voyage will highlight the reasons the waterway has remained vibrant, including tourism, hydropower for industry and water for irrigation and industrial processing. “Children in China know the song ‘15 Miles on the Erie Canal,’ ” he said, “but not that it has never really stopped being an economic powerhouse.”",The New York Times
2018,"Florida Governor Signs Gun Limits Into Law, Breaking With the N.R.A.","MIAMI — Florida’s nickname has long been the “Gunshine State” because of its plethora of firearms and loose gun restrictions. Then a troubled teenager stormed into a South Florida high school and shot 17 people dead. On Friday, in a dramatic turnaround in one of the most gun-friendly states in America, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law an array of gun limits that included raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 and extending the waiting period to three days. It was the most aggressive action on gun control taken in the state in decades and the first time Mr. Scott, who had an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association, had broken so significantly from the group. The sweeping and bipartisan law is named after Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a former student, Nikolas Cruz, was charged with launching the massacre on Feb. 14. The law imposes new restrictions on firearm purchases and the possession of “bump stocks,” funds more school police officers and mental health services, broadens law enforcement’s power to seize weapons, and allows certain staff members to carry guns in schools. Florida’s embrace of gun restrictions came as Congress remains mired in partisan divisions on the issue and as other states, from Illinois to Vermont, consider whether they ought to tighten the rules on gun ownership in the wake of the Parkland attack. Florida’s action gave hope to gun control proponents and sent the N.R.A. scrambling to contain the damage. Within hours of Mr. Scott signing the legislation, the N.R.A. filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court, arguing that Florida’s age restriction was “a blanket ban” that violated the Second Amendment, as well as the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. The N.R.A. asserted that the law was a particularly egregious violation of the rights of young women, who they contended “pose a relatively slight risk of perpetrating a school shooting such as the one that occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, or, for that matter, a violent crime of any kind.” Standing with a group of families who had traveled to the State Capitol from Parkland, an emotional Mr. Scott called the classmates of the slain students and their parents his inspiration, and praised them for helping persuade lawmakers to pass legislation, even if neither they nor he agreed with all of its provisions. “You made your voices heard,” he told the Stoneman Douglas High students. “You helped change your state. You made a difference. You should be proud.” Outside of Tallahassee, the law might not look that groundbreaking: It does not go as far as laws enacted by other more Democratic-leaning states after deadly shootings. Connecticut expanded a ban on assault weapons, prohibited the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines and imposed stricter background checks on gun purchases after 20 children and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in 2012. Colorado required background checks for private gun sales and limited magazines after 12 people were killed at a movie theater in 2012. But this is Florida, a laboratory for the N.R.A. and a state that has become recognized for its consistent efforts under legislative Republican control since 1996 to expand gun rights. For example, residents only have to comply with a simple protocol to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. And Florida has embraced “Stand Your Ground” laws that protect the use of deadly force in public. That such a gun-friendly state adopted any firearm restrictions represents a sea change, even more so as the restrictions were drafted and approved in a matter of three weeks, after a bipartisan vote and the signature of a Republican governor likely to be on the ballot later this year as a Senate candidate. “If you would have had this conversation with me before session, I would’ve said it’s just not going to happen,” said Senator René García, a moderate Republican from the Miami area who has served 16 years in the Legislature. “Not only did we get this bill passed, but the fact that we had debate on these amendments on the floor was huge. I don’t remember having these debates on the floor ever before.” The N.R.A. has had to contend with other states also considering action since the Parkland shooting. In Illinois, lawmakers passed a bill last week that would require gun dealers to be licensed by the state, but it was not clear whether the Republican governor would sign it into law. In Vermont, lawmakers advanced legislation that would raise the minimum age to buy a gun to 21 and allow for judges to seize guns from people deemed dangerous. Elsewhere, legislators took steps toward expanding the legal use of firearms. In Mississippi, state senators approved a bill on Wednesday that would allow trained school employees to carry concealed weapons. And in Missouri, a House committee last week advanced a bill that would allow people with concealed-carry permits to have a weapon in so-called gun-free zones. The law’s passage came as a surprise to many in Florida, where lawmakers had failed to enact legislation after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, which left 49 dead, and the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport that killed five people in 2017. The governor mentioned both crimes on Friday. Lawmakers like Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, voted against the bill because it did not include a ban on assault weapons or other broad measures sought by survivors of all the shootings. “The bill doesn’t deal with the real problem at all: The problem is guns,” he said. On the other side of the debate, lawmakers from the most conservative rural districts and Republicans seeking statewide office in contested primaries opposed the new law, saying it trampled on Second Amendment rights. “I just can’t imagine that Nikolas Cruz can commit such a heinous crime and then, as a result, we tell potentially a 20-year-old single mother living alone that she cannot purchase a firearm to protect herself,” Representative Jay Fant of Jacksonville, a Republican running for attorney general, said on the House floor. Mr. Scott can afford to break with the gun lobby now because he is unlikely to face a Republican primary in his expected Senate campaign against Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, in the midterms in November. In signing the bill, Mr. Scott offered a glimpse at how he might use the legislation in the coming campaign to paint Congress as ineffective. “If you look at the federal government, nothing seems to happen there,” Mr. Scott said, noting he was enacting legislation just three weeks and two days after the rampage. “That’s how government should work.” Mr. Scott remains opposed to the provision in the law that the N.R.A. has been seeking for years: Allowing for certain teachers and school staff to be armed on campus. But he called the legislation a compromise and noted that the so-called guardian program is voluntary: “If counties do not want to do this, they simply can say no.” The state’s largest and most urban school districts are expected to do just that. In Tallahassee, the families who joined Mr. Scott chose Tony Montalto, whose daughter, Gina, was killed in the Parkland shooting, to deliver a statement calling the legislation “an important first step to enhance the safety of our schools.” “When it comes to preventing future acts of horrific school violence, this is the beginning of the journey,” Mr. Montalto said. “We have paid a terrible price for this progress.” Rebecca Schneid, 16, the editor of The Eagle Eye, the Stoneman Douglas High student newspaper, also applauded the bill, even while admitting it was “not perfect.” “I never really expected to get something done so fast,” she said. “We’ve been calling them out, and that really scared them. And that’s scaring them into making sure they actually do represent us. They know that if they don’t, we’re going to vote them out.” “We’re going to keep sending people to Tallahassee,” she went on, “because when we go away, this goes away.”",The New York Times
2018,"Florida Gun Bill: What’s in It, and What Isn’t","The gun control bill that the Florida Legislature passed on Wednesday was, in many respects, a major victory for the new activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It was passed in defiance of the National Rifle Association and, if Gov. Rick Scott signs it, will be the first successful gun control measure in Florida in more than 20 years. But it left out many of the biggest provisions the students and their supporters had sought, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Here is a look at what is in the final bill, and what is not. • Raise the minimum age. The bill would change the minimum age for all gun purchases to 21 from 18 — a provision that would have prohibited the Parkland gunman, Nikolas Cruz, 19, from legally buying the rifle he used in his massacre. This is a divergence from federal law, under which people cannot buy handguns from licensed dealers until they are 21, but can buy shotguns and rifles — often much deadlier than handguns — at 18. (Unlicensed sales, such as at gun shows, have looser restrictions.) Governor Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, a fellow Republican, endorsed the age increase last month. • Create a waiting period. Prospective gun buyers would have to wait three days, or until a background check is completed, whichever is longer. There would be some exceptions, including for police officers, members of the military, licensed hunters and licensed concealed carriers. • Ban bump stocks. Bump stocks are devices that can be attached to rifles to enable them to fire faster, and they will no longer be legal in Florida if the bill is signed. (You can learn more about them here.) They came to public attention in October, after a gunman in Las Vegas used them to kill 58 people and wound hundreds; with the devices, his semiautomatic weapons were able to fire almost as fast as fully automatic machine guns. After that massacre, the N.R.A. said it supported a national ban on bump stocks, an extremely rare gun control endorsement by the group. But the proposal languished in Congress, and while President Trump told the Justice Department last month to issue new regulations, thus far it has not. • Arm school employees. Perhaps the most controversial provision of the bill is one that would allow superintendents and sheriffs to arm school personnel — a measure not requested by the Parkland students but long desired by the N.R.A., which argues that gun-free zones prevent people from defending themselves in an attack. Specifically, the bill would create a $67 million “marshal” program under which certain employees — including counselors, coaches and librarians, but not full-time classroom teachers — could be trained and armed. (The program would be voluntary.) Under an amendment successfully proposed by State Senator Randolph Bracy, a Democrat, these employees would first have to undergo 12 hours of diversity training. • Fund school security. The bill allocates millions of dollars to make buildings more secure and to hire more school-based police officers. However, when the Parkland shooting happened, an armed school resource officer was present, standing by the door to the building, and did not enter. (The officer, Scot Peterson, resigned from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office after his actions were called into question; Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference last month that he should have gone into the building and confronted the gunman. Mr. Peterson later said he acted the way he did because he thought the gunfire was coming from outside.) • Expand mental health services and regulations. Florida school districts would receive state funding to provide mental health care to students. Additionally, the bill would allow the police to temporarily confiscate guns from anyone subject to involuntary psychiatric evaluation under Florida’s Baker Act. It would also prohibit gun sales to Floridians who were committed to mental institutions or deemed mentally incompetent by a judge, and would allow the police — with judicial approval — to bar a person deemed dangerous from owning guns for up to a year. • Ban assault weapons. One of the biggest demands of the Parkland students — as well as many lawmakers, including some Republicans generally sympathetic to the N.R.A. — was a ban on assault weapons. The term is ambiguous and would have needed to be defined in any such legislation; a federal ban that was in place from 1994 to 2004 applied to semiautomatic weapons with two or more of a list of specific features (for example, a telescoping stock and a pistol grip). The wounds caused by these weapons can be far more devastating than a handgun injury, and in polls, majorities support banning them. • Suspend AR-15 sales. Once it became clear that a majority of the Florida Legislature was not inclined to ban all assault weapons, Senator Oscar Braynon, a Democrat, proposed an amendment to the gun control bill that would have halted AR-15 sales for two years. The AR-15 and its variants have become the weapons of choice for many mass shooters, including Mr. Cruz as well as the gunmen in Sutherland Springs, Tex.; Las Vegas; Orlando, Fla.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Newtown, Conn.; and Aurora, Colo. With such a weapon, an attacker can wield essentially the same firepower as American soldiers. Mr. Braynon’s amendment was rejected. • Ban high-capacity magazines. The bill does not ban high-capacity magazines, which can hold as many as 100 rounds. These magazines allow gunmen to shoot more people in less time, because they do not have to stop to reload as often. (In addition to the obvious — forcing a pause in the gunfire — reloading can afford a brief opportunity to take the gunman down. The 2011 shooting in Tucson, Ariz., which killed six people and gravely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords, ended when the gunman stopped to reload and onlookers grabbed the new magazine from his hands and tackled him.) Like a ban on assault weapons, this is a proposal with widespread public support. • Strengthen background checks. Changes to background check procedures have received bipartisan support since the Parkland shooting, including from President Trump, but the Florida bill does not address them. Federal law requires background checks for gun sales by licensed dealers, but there are holes in the system. Private firearm sales are not always subject to checks, for example. And officials do not always inform the F.B.I.’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System of things, like criminal convictions and mental illnesses, that could disqualify a person from buying a gun. The Sutherland Springs shooter, for example, had been court-martialed for domestic violence, but the Air Force did not submit that information to the federal database; nor did it report similar information about dozens of other people.",The New York Times
2018,"Florida Gun Control Bill Passed by House, Defying N.R.A.","MIAMI — Florida lawmakers gave final passage to a $400 million gun control and school safety bill on Wednesday in defiance of the National Rifle Association, which opposed the legislation’s firearm restrictions. The bipartisan vote came three weeks after a gunman killed 17 people in a rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The legislation, which passed the State Senate on Monday and now heads to the governor, would raise the minimum age to purchase any firearm to 21 from 18; impose a three-day waiting period on gun purchases; fund school police officers and mental health counselors; and allow local school districts and sheriffs to arm certain school personnel. It would also ban so-called bump stocks, which make guns fire faster, and give law enforcement more power to commit people deemed a threat. While the gun bill was the first to pass in the state in years, it fell short of the demands of many of the students and educators who have in recent weeks led a national call for stronger firearm restrictions. (Read our article about exactly what’s in the bill, and what’s not, here.) The emotional debate in the House, which lasted eight hours, culminated with powerful remarks from Representative Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who graduated from Stoneman Douglas High and told of attending the funerals of the dead. He broke down and needed a moment to compose himself when he shared that one of the victims, Jaime Guttenberg, was the daughter of his son’s preschool writing teacher. The chamber, which bustled with activity during almost every other speech, was rapt in attention. Vote for the bill, Mr. Moskowitz implored his colleagues. “This isn’t hard,” Mr. Moskowitz said. “Putting your kid in the ground is hard. This is easy.” “This may be the most consequential vote we ever take on this floor,” said Representative Shawn Harrison, Republican of Tampa. “Grown-ups protect our kids. It’s what we do. It’s our turn. Don’t let them down.” The legislation passed, with a vote of 67 to 50. Lawmakers rose, looked up into the public gallery and applauded Andrew Pollack, whose daughter, Meadow, was killed in the shooting. He sat through the debate and remained until the vote, even though it likely meant he missed his flight back home. Hours earlier, the grand jury in Broward County charged Nikolas Cruz, the suspect in the Feb. 14 massacre — one of the deadliest school shootings in American history — with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. The indictment of Mr. Cruz, who has confessed to the killings, was essentially a formality, and the primary legal debate now centers on whether prosecutors should seek the death penalty. Mr. Cruz’s lawyers have offered a plea bargain — consecutive life sentences without parole — in a bid to avoid a trial and the threat of execution. “The only question is does he live or does he die?” said Howard Finkelstein, the Broward County public defender, whose office is representing Mr. Cruz. “The question for the community, and specifically the victims’ families — is it worth what will be a three-year trial odyssey followed by a 15-year appellate odyssey?” In the State Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, the provision to voluntarily arm trained school “guardians,” including librarians and school counselors, threatened to derail the legislation. But the families of all 17 people killed in Parkland sent House members a letter on Tuesday urging them to vote yes. “You must act to prevent mass murder from ever occurring again at any school,” they wrote. “This issue cannot wait. The moment to pass this bill is now.” On Thursday, several House Democrats cited the letter as the reason they would favor the proposal, even after the Democratic caucus took a formal position against it. The legislation prompted raw comments on the House floor and exposed a racial divide among Democrats: Black legislators warned their white counterparts that arming educators might result in discrimination against students of color. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, has not said if he will sign the bill into law. His own proposal after the Parkland shooting did not envision arming school personnel or requiring a waiting period for all gun purchases.",The New York Times
2018,Florida Island,"Wordplay TUESDAY PUZZLE — Another debut in The New York Times Crossword today, and we welcome Carl Worth, who is offering an imaginary but welcome respite of sorts from the cold weather here in the northeast. Mr. Worth offers us a respite on a beautiful Florida island called KEY WEST, although our trip is really only as far as our keyboards. The theme set he has put together consists of four two-word phrases (one might be tougher than the others) that all have a keyboard key at the first — or WEST — position of the phrase. For example, to “Change one’s approach” is to SHIFT GEARS (I wanted SWITCH GEARS for that, but that wouldn’t have worked), with SHIFT being the key in the WEST position. At first, I thought that the reference to KEY WEST meant that all of the keys in the set would be on the left or west side of the keyboard, but ENTER is on the right, so that wasn’t it. I dove back in and stared at the grid until it dawned on me that all the keys were on the left or west side of the phrase. There’s not a lot that’s new here, but the fill is fun. I love ESCAPE ROOMS, and was happy to see it included. CONTROL FREAK is also a fun entry, and it hasn’t been overdone. This might be a slightly tough solve for those who are just joining us. As always, hang in there, and if you need to take a break and come back to finish the puzzle, it’s perfectly O.K. to do so. For more tips and tricks, please see our solving guide, which takes you from sitting down with the puzzle through the trickier clues. 14A: Honestly, the last thing I might do to a turtle that has withdrawn into its shell is POKE it. A turtle who is withdrawn is scared, so why would I make things worse? 16A: This is a kind of partner clue: “Rod’s mate” is looking for another word that is typically paired with “rod” and separated by the word “and.” The answer here is REEL, as in “rod and REEL.” Want to get some more practice with this kind of clue? Try our solving guide, which has a whole section on it and a practice mini crossword. 24A: I was not familiar with this song, but that’s the nice thing about wheelhouses: It might have been a gimme for someone else. The “Metallica hit with the lyric ‘Sleep with one eye open’” is the song “ENTER SANDMAN.” Hello, world! I’ve been constructing logic puzzles for a while (see gmpuzzles.com and recent U.S. Puzzle Championships for examples), but crosswords are entirely new to me. Thanks for your patience while I’m learning, and I hope you enjoyed this puzzle as much as I did. I started with ESCAPE ROOM — a fun entry that was still unpublished at the time, but has appeared twice since my puzzle was accepted in August. As a computer programmer, it was natural for me to take the theme in the direction I did. Once I struck on the KEY WEST revealer I was sure it could work. Little did I know how much effort there is between settling on theme entries and completing a puzzle. I never could have succeeded without the help of an expert mentor. Huge thanks to Craig Kasper for his patience with countless revisions. Craig also deserves credit for suggesting ENTER SANDMAN and teaching me a lot about grid design and evaluating fill. My first revision of the puzzle was rejected for poor fill, but Will and Joel kindly encouraged me to try again. My second submission still had some unacceptable entries, but primarily concentrated in a single corner. Will had a colleague take a crack at fixing that corner and sent me the result. It was an improvement in every way, so thanks, unnamed colleague! [The corner was redone by digital puzzles editor Joel Fagliano. — D.A.] It’s interesting to see the changes the editors made to my clues, (39 of 80 clues were changed). Many of the changes were minor, but every change improved one or more of clarity, specificity, smoothness, appropriate difficulty or liveliness. Any clunkiness that remains is entirely mine. One thing I will say about the clues is that if you find a turtle snapping at your finger, don’t blame me! Almost finished solving but just need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but now you can take a peek at the answer key. While the answers are free to everyone, the Crossword puzzles require a subscription.

2018,"Florida School, on Edge Since Shooting, Requires Students to Carry Clear Backpacks","MIAMI — The Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last month will require students to carry only clear backpacks, school administrators announced on Wednesday, after the shooting suspect’s brother was charged with trespassing on campus and two students were arrested on charges of carrying knives. The episodes again called into question the safety of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a little more than a month after the deadly shooting that shook the affluent suburban community of Parkland, about an hour north of Miami. Robert W. Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, sent a letter to the families of Stoneman Douglas High students imposing the new backpack rule, reminiscent of security measures at airports and professional sports venues. He said any student without a clear backpack would be provided one at no cost after spring break, which takes place next week. Students also will be issued identification badges, which they will be required to wear at all times while in school. Staff members have badges as well. In addition, Mr. Runcie said the district was considering using metal-detecting wands at school entrances and installing permanent metal detectors — a safety measure Mr. Runcie recently criticized as ineffective. A person intent on committing an atrocity would find his or her way around them, he said in an interview last month. “Someone is not going to go through a metal detector with an AR-15,” he said at the time, adding that metal detectors do not help create a welcoming learning environment and pose a logistical challenge in a school as large as Stoneman Douglas High, which has more than 3,200 students. Stoneman Douglas High parents, already on edge since the massacre, became alarmed Monday when the shooting suspect’s brother was arrested on a charge of trespassing, after Broward County sheriff’s deputies said they saw him skateboarding onto the campus after school let out. A deputy assigned to patrol the campus was found asleep by a student the same afternoon, the sheriff’s office said; he was suspended without pay. Some parents kept their children home on Tuesday, according to Sarahnell Murphy, an assistant state attorney prosecuting the trespassing case against Zachary Cruz, the brother of the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz. Also on Tuesday, the sheriff’s office said it had arrested three Stoneman Douglas High students, one for making threats on Snapchat and two for wielding knives. Jordan Salter, a girl accused of pulling a knife on a boy after a cafeteria confrontation, made a court appearance on Wednesday. Her father, Scott, told the court his daughter had been “terrified” of going to school. The arrests Monday and Tuesday prompted Gov. Rick Scott to offer state assistance to Mr. Runcie and the Broward sheriff, Scott Israel, to secure Stoneman Douglas High’s entryways. Sheriff Israel accepted the help; eight Florida Highway Patrol troopers will report to work at the school on Thursday, according to the governor’s office. In his letter on Wednesday, Mr. Runcie also outlined other steps the district was taking across county schools, such as evaluating “code red” active-shooter protocols and drills, and upgrading surveillance camera systems. Schools with multiple entry points would have single points of entry by the first quarter of 2019, he said. A new Florida law passed after the shooting will set aside $8.5 million for the school district to pay for at least one armed police officer at each school starting in the fall. Broward also will receive $6 million to expand school mental health services, according to Mr. Runcie. Reacting on Twitter to the news that only clear backpacks would be allowed at school, Kyra Parrow, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, criticized the move as “making my school seem like jail now because legislators don’t have common sense gun reform on their agendas.”",The New York Times
2018,Florida Teacher Says Her Racist Podcast Was ‘Satire’,"A middle school teacher in Florida who has admitted hosting a white nationalist podcast has been removed from her classroom as officials investigate whether she is really a racist. Officials at the Citrus County School District, about 80 miles north of Tampa, Fla., said they were made aware of the podcast, called “Unapologetic,” last week after being contacted by HuffPost. The news website reported on Saturday that the teacher, Dayanna Volitich, was connected to the podcast. Although the podcast and a Twitter account — which Ms. Volitich operated under the pseudonym “Tiana Dalichov” — appear to have been taken off the internet, the HuffPost report included a recording of the podcast and screenshots of tweets she sent. On the podcast, she argues that “science” has proved that certain races are smarter than others and brags about preaching white nationalism in her classroom — and hiding it from administrators. In tweets, she makes reference to the “horrors of #Islam,” attacks the concept of white privilege, and says that it isn’t “hateful or supremacist to prefer your own people over others.” In a statement on Tuesday, Ms. Volitich, 25, admitted to using a pseudonym on social media and on the podcast, but insisted she was not a white nationalist. She said she had not allowed her political beliefs to seep into the way she teaches social studies. “I employed political satire and exaggeration, mainly to the end of attracting listeners and followers, and generating conversation about the content discussed between myself and my guests,” Ms. Volitich said in a statement provided by her lawyer, Charles E. Moore Jr. “The views ‘Tiana Dalichov’ espouses do not pervade my professional career.” “As an adult, my decisions are my own, and my family has nothing whatsoever to do with my social media accounts or my podcast,” she continued. “From them, I humbly ask for forgiveness, as it was never my intention to cause them grief while engaging in a hobby on my personal time.” School officials called the podcast “concerning” and said an investigation was initiated immediately after they were contacted by HuffPost; the teacher involved was also “removed from the classroom,” they said. Michael P. Mullen, an assistant superintendent, confirmed in an email on Tuesday that the teacher involved was Ms. Volitich, who is listed online as a social studies teacher at Crystal River Middle School. School district officials said they could not provide additional comment until their investigation was completed. It was not clear when that would be. The most recent data available from the Florida Department of Education shows that during the 2015-16 school year, about 88 percent of Crystal River Middle School’s students were white.",The New York Times
2018,Florida Will Seek Execution of Nikolas Cruz in Parkland Shooting Trial,"A Florida prosecutor said Tuesday that he would seek the death penalty against the man accused of killing 17 people last month at a high school in Parkland, moving the state closer to a rare trial for someone charged in a mass shooting. Michael J. Satz, the state attorney for Broward County, made his decision public less than a month after the rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and one day before students nationwide were expected to stage walkouts to demand new gun-control measures. The decision to seek the death penalty against Nikolas Cruz, 19, was widely expected, in part because Mr. Satz had hinted at his plans days after the attack. Lawyers for Mr. Cruz, who have repeatedly said that he would plead guilty in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole, are not expected to contest his guilt at what is certain to be an agonizing and emotional trial. They will instead focus on proving mitigating circumstances, such as extreme mental duress, that could persuade a single juror to block a death sentence. But in a filing in Circuit Court in Broward County, Mr. Satz cited seven aggravating factors that he said prosecutors would prove and that would make Mr. Cruz eligible for execution. Those factors, enshrined in Florida law, include that Mr. Cruz “knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons” and that the capital felony at issue was “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.” Mr. Satz, whose state has 347 people on its death row, had no comment beyond the court filing. In a statement last month, though, he said the attack at Stoneman Douglas High “certainly is the type of case the death penalty was designed for.” Howard Finkelstein, the public defender for Broward County and one of Mr. Cruz’s lawyers, said Tuesday that Mr. Cruz remained “ready to immediately plead guilty.” Mr. Cruz has chosen to stand mute, which in Florida effectively amounts to a not guilty plea, rather than disputing his guilt in the massacre. “We are not saying he is not guilty,” Mr. Finkelstein said, “but we can’t plead guilty while death is still on the table.” Mr. Cruz has been indicted on 34 counts: 17 of premeditated murder in the first degree, and 17 of attempted murder in the first degree. Relatively few suspects are ever brought to trial for mass shootings. Among the suspects in the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern American history, only Mr. Cruz, a former Stoneman Douglas High student, was apprehended alive. And prosecutors have amassed something of a mixed record in trials involving mass killings. Last year, for example, a federal jury condemned the white supremacist Dylann S. Roof to death for killing nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C. But in 2015, a Colorado jury spared the life of James E. Holmes, who killed 12 people at a movie theater in Aurora.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Florida at 200 M.P.H.,"Sporting ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — You wouldn’t peg me as an IndyCar fan. I’m a bookish, nervous woman staring down midlife, someone who likes to be quiet and who tries hard not to go out in the sun. I hate driving fast, I loathe aggressive drivers, and I have experienced a number of serious anxiety attacks when trying to navigate crowded interstates at high speeds. But here’s the thing: I love racecars. I grew up in a motor-head family. My two brothers and I had a king’s ransom of Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars, and we vroomed them relentlessly around the living room baseboards, across the kitchen table, along the back of the console TV. My dad is a gear head and speed freak; some of my earliest memories are of his taking us to drag-racing time trials and to watch unlimited hydroplanes taking flight in Miami Marine Stadium. I married a motor head, too — a gentle man who speaks softly and makes himself a cup of hot tea every night, but who can recite lines from Steve McQueen’s “Le Mans” and who recently affixed a huge “65” racing decal to his vintage Volvo (“Just for fun,” he says). So when IndyCar recently came to Florida for the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, I was there — heart pumping, eyes popping, ears ringing. A sea of IndyCars buzzed violently around the streets of this winsome little Florida city, and the vehicular throng could not be more thrilling or more vibrant. The world was suddenly alive with metallic, high-speed color, and the sweet thrill of my Hot Wheels childhood came rushing back. The sound of 24 IndyCars in flat-out combat was a hivelike buzzing — a high-intensity hum that faded when the cars rounded a curve out of sight but that re-upped when they appeared in the straightaway. The Firestone Grand Prix is the annual opening race of the Verizon IndyCar Series. For me, the pulse point of the race is in the absurd dichotomy of its setting. Nearly two dozen venerable IndyCars — the hands-down Goliaths of American testosterone — hurtle through the streets of one of Florida’s artsiest and most comely neighborhoods. IndyCar in St. Pete, a tradition since 2005, is a gift. It puts St. Petersburg in the league of some of the most storied locations in motor sports. Think Monaco or Le Mans. It lets the nation see Florida — beautiful and complex and mysterious and thrilling — in a different light, at least for a few days. Florida gets such a bad rap. We’re the boom-and-bust court jesters of the continental United States, and sometimes I’m convinced we’re seen by our compatriots as a cutely dumb, slightly embarrassing appendage populated entirely by retirees, rednecks, theme parks and opioids. We’ve got people living under bridges and shootings on end and mortifyingly low education funding. Flori-duh they’re calling us. We’ve got so much perceived crazy we earned our own meme: Florida Man. Still, downtown St. Pete is pretty, darn it — seriously pretty, with crisply manicured landscaping, waterfront bistros, blocks of Art Deco Floridiana and an army of chortling sea gulls that seem to ascend on cue to fandango against a subtropic sunrise. And into this artsy, balmy Shangri-La comes, for one weekend, a loud, lionhearted parade of real-live action heroes in bona fide Batmobiles. Just look at the names on the drivers’ roster: Will Power. Takuma Sato. Josef Newgarden. They’re like Marvel’s Avengers, a troupe of dauntless young intellects in flame-retardant suits, driving vehicles that have sprung fully formed from the imaginations of every kid who ever fashioned a superhero cape out of a bedsheet — which, of course, was all of us. All I could think, as I watched the pre-race ceremonies — the drivers shimmy into their cockpits, the engines pop and buzz to life, the pace car leads the contenders to the course — was that this was, well, the most impressive thing ever. And it’s in Florida. Take that, hanging chads. This is the haut monde of motor sports — the fastest cars, the most challenging circuits, the most expensive technologies. It’s also earsplitting, adrenaline-chugging fun — the chance to stand mere feet from a scathing swarm of mammoth automotive hornets hurtling at more than 200 miles per hour through a winding street course. When the race began, I was atop a parking garage adjacent to the urbane Dali Museum. From there, the view of Turns 1 and 2 were pristine, and the vantage seemed safer. Turn 9 funneled the raging cars into a straightaway overlooking a tranquil cotillion of anchored yachts. Watching practice runs earlier in the day, I became keenly aware that a single errant rivet from one of these high-tech missiles would be enough to hurt a person unlucky enough to be standing nearby. This race can kill spectators, and it has. I decided to take my chances on top of the parking garage. One hundred and 10 laps later, Sébastian Bourdais (a St. Petersburg resident!) took the checkered flag. I was pink with sunburn and exhausted from the stimulation. IndyCar needs Florida, too. There’s only one Sunshine State and only one Sunshine City, and that would be St. Petersburg, which holds the Guinness World Record for most consecutive sunny days (768). It’s an American Monte Carlo. A lot of things about Florida may be a mess, but spring weather isn’t one of them. We live in paradise. A view of a March St. Petersburg sun glittering on a speeding IndyCar’s brightly painted chassis is a sight to behold. By kicking off its season in St. Pete, IndyCar hitches its wagon to a hundred-year history of Florida car racing, one that brings to mind Sebring, Nascar and Malcolm Campbell setting speed records on the beaches of Daytona in the late 1920s. This year, Firestone announced the Grand Prix will continue until at least 2020, and hopefully beyond. That’s good news for Florida. And good news for IndyCar. And good news for me, too. Ah, St. Pete. Ah, Florida. Well played. You need this sort of event.",The New York Times
2018,"Flush Over Tax Cuts, Trump Says ‘Phase 2’ Is Coming","ST. LOUIS — Amid all the turmoil and uncertainty, with his White House seemingly fraying, his legislative agenda stalled and his electoral base in danger, President Trump these days finds one area of comfort: talking about his tax cuts. He finds it so reassuring, in fact, that he is increasingly talking about doing it all over again. Mr. Trump came here to red-state Middle America on Wednesday to promote the economic benefits of the $1.5 trillion in tax breaks he signed in December, surrounding himself with workers and business owners who celebrated the prospect of more money in their pockets. As he basked in the praise, the president promised that he was not done. “We’re now going for a Phase 2,” he told a selected group of supporters at a Boeing factory in St. Louis. He did not describe what would be in such a Phase 2 but said he would team up with Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “It’s going to be something very special. Kevin Brady’s working on it with me.” Mr. Brady said earlier in the day that he hoped to pass another tax-cutting bill by the end of the year. “We’re really encouraged,” he said on Fox Business Network. “Main Street optimism is at record levels. Our economy is really gaining momentum and booming in a big way. But look, we think even more can be done. We want to make sure that we’re encouraging innovation in America. We want to help families save for the long term.” If Mr. Trump had a plan in mind, it was a mystery to many of his aides, who knew nothing about it. What Mr. Trump and Mr. Brady might be talking about, however, could be more of a branding exercise than a major legislative effort that stands any chance of becoming law this year. The effort they are calling “Phase 2” appears to unify two lingering problems from the tax cut bill that Republicans sped through Congress late last year. In both cases, fixing them would require support from Senate Democrats, who are not inclined to lend any backing to a tax bill that they opposed and that was passed over their objections. One problem is that tax cuts for individuals are set to expire at the end of 2025. That is a byproduct of the budget reconciliation process that Republicans employed to pass the bill without Democratic support. To comply with rules against increasing budget deficits after 10 years, Republicans made the individual cuts temporary. Mr. Brady alluded to that on Wednesday. “While the tax cuts for families were long term, they’re not yet permanent,” he said. “So we’re going to address issues like that, and we’re in discussions with the White House, with the president about this issue.” A second issue, which Mr. Brady also addressed, is the host of legislative ambiguities and hiccups that companies and accountants have discovered in the law since it was passed. Those include the so-called grain glitch, which inadvertently gave an advantage to agricultural cooperatives over other, independent businesses that farmers might sell to, and a provision that diminishes the tax benefits from renovating restaurants. Senate leaders have discussed fixing the grain glitch in a coming spending bill. But a Republican Senate aide said there was little optimism for Congress pushing another stand-alone tax package this year. Mr. Trump’s interest in repeating his tax cut success may not be surprising given the validation he received at the Boeing plant here. Bonnie Brazzeal, who works in the cafeteria at the College of the Ozarks, choked up when she told the president that she received a bonus from her employer as a result of the tax cut. “I am very grateful for the bonus when the college gave it to us,” Ms. Brazzeal said. “I put mine in my savings for retirement.” She then wiped away tears. Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, attributed the company’s strong performance to Mr. Trump. “What you see is your leadership on tax reform and creating jobs,” Mr. Muilenburg said. “There’s no place that’s more evident than the factories of America, and you can see it here.” Mr. Trump said that when it came to the economy, there was more to come. “I don’t see any downward movement,” he said. “I see just up.” Because of an error in a Fox Business Network transcript, an earlier version of this article misquoted Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, from a televised interview. He said, “Main Street optimism is at record levels,” not “Mainstream optimism is at record levels.”",The New York Times
2018,Follow the Sun,"Wordplay SUNDAY PUZZLE — Forgive me for repeating myself to the regulars, but for any Sunday-only solvers (or Wordplay readers), this weekend is the 41st annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. If you’re interested in seeing how any of your fellow solvers and constructors are doing, there’s lots of information on their site; if you’re interested in a challenge, you can also buy the tournament puzzles to solve online. Our constructor today, Finn Vigeland, is there. We’ve got this one to chew on at home, though. It’s a good one — the theme crept up on me, at least, and I was duly impressed with how slickly the theme answers wove themselves into the grid. Step one: There are six down clues that contain three bubbles in a row. Although the puzzle is of normal diagonal symmetry, these entries aren’t. Three are on the left-hand (west) side of the grid and three are on the right, though, and that’s important. On the west side, the three letters read S-U-N in each case, a setting “sun.” For example, at 58D, the answer is SUNK COST, and the first three letters are circled. On the east side, the three letters are reversed, so the “sun” rises, as in 52D, for one: MENUS. This is pretty cute and simple, and on another day or another place that could’ve been it. I knew enough to look for the next layer of trickery, though, and for a little anxious while I couldn’t find it. But here is step two: For each of these instances, the word “sun” gets used in a phrase that is clued in a corresponding across clue, that runs across to the “S” in “sun,” turns down (in the west) or up (in the east) to the “n,” then turns again, to the right, to finish using a few letters from another across clue. Aaugh, you say? Let’s look at the middle entry on the west side, that uses 58D (SUNK COST) as the source for that necessary “sun.” The across entry that ends in the “s” that starts that “sun” is 56A, “Hollywood labor groups.” I was scratching my head when I deduced that entry to be ACTORS, an incomplete definition to be sure. But then I filled in the entry that used the “n” in that same “sun,” 67A, “2015 hit spinoff of Despicable Me.” This was MINIONS. If you’re looking for labor groups, you’ll see ACTORS UNIONS right there, starting with 56A, the theme clue, ACTORS; turning down at 58D, SUNK COST; and turning right when you meet 67A, MINIONS. I could see the upper west entry being a bit confounding, as out of all of the theme words, 26A on its own — MEGATS — wasn’t a word or a decipherable beginning to any phrase. The rest of the clues broke up a bit more cleanly, but I don’t begrudge Mr. Vigeland this entry, it was just challenging. The rest of the rules to this game were tightly observed. My favorite was the middle right-hand phrase, where “sun” ran upward in the aforementioned MENUS. The clue that ended in the “s” from that sun was 68A, “How someone in awe might describe himself,” and I found no way to make sense of it as I filled out, using crosses, MONKEYS. The clue at 60A was definitely a “tricky” one. I, adult student of plant science and botany, felt pretty smart knowing PEDUNCLE — I can’t imagine that being in most people’s vocabulary, and it’s been in The Times exactly once before, in a 2002 acrostic. Nevertheless, PEDUNCLE is necessary to our second clever phrase. If you read MONKEYS across —> SUN up —> NCLE right, you get MONKEY’S UNCLE. As in, “I’ll be a monkey’s uncle!” As far as cluing, Mr. Vigeland uses a lot of idiom and humor in his entries, most of which I found fresh and fun. I loved the clues for ARMHOLE, REIGN, DEF, DHS, EMAILING, DELETE, EDU, TRIOS, DIME and RYE. I took small issue with UNWED and REAL TALK. 22A: A habitual drinker is a ROUNDER, one who makes the rounds (from bar to bar, or drunk tank to tank). 48A: I’m sure there’s a crossword-solving ultramarathoner with a couple of grandkids that’s going to look sideways at this clue, although it does own up, at least, to overgeneralizing. This isn’t the first time GRANNIES has been an entry in the puzzle, but it’s previously been clued as “certain knots” rather than “ones in rocking chairs, stereotypically.” 54A: This clue, “Start to many bumper stickers,” I HEART it. There aren’t nearly enough I HEART SOMETHING bumper stickers around anymore; was that a phase? We had those magnetic ribbons for every cause known to man, and now I feel like this kind of ornamentation has gotten a lot less common on our cars. 88A: There is a beautiful pale jade color that signifies early spring and delicate Asian pottery, called “celadon,” but that didn’t fit here. The answer that did is less satisfying, somehow; TEA GREEN seems like a gotcha to me, since “green tea” is so common in paint company palettes and the like. 113A: I misentered “Version” for this one word clue, “Draft.” It clogged up that bottom foot for a few minutes. This is one of those words with a lot of options: soldier’s call up, order at a pub, annual sporting event, kind of horse, or a chilly breeze, as in this case, indicating AIR FLOW. After the last few weeks, in our area at least, this probably should have been the first definition to come to mind. 122A: Another botanical reference, TANSIES are in the aster family. They’re the little yellow button flowers that you see growing on the side of the road or in meadows, cute but considered a toxic menace in the United States and not grown in gardens (on purpose). 5D: Who would have thought that SAMSUNG a) “means ‘three stars’” and b) is a Times crossword debut? Turns out this ol’ technology giant dates back to 1938, as a company exporting produce and fish to Manchuria and Beijing. The three stars represent prosperity, status and longevity — that last attribute seems facetious, when you’re talking about smartphones. 33D: The answer here, TIN HATS, meaning “paranoid sorts, in slang,” seemed to be missing its foil. The slang term refers to people who haberdash themselves with aluminum to prevent some sort of invasive invisible waves from penetrating their skulls and scrambling up their brains. I really hope that we won’t learn one day that Wi-Fi does this, don’t you? 44D: The term ACID TEST, meaning an irrefutable evaluation, reoccurs in the puzzle from time to time. This usage stems from old-time metallurgy, when the quality of gold was verified using the touchstone method; nowadays, I think more of Ken Kesey’s parties. Those go back 50 years now too, pretty old-timey. Nostalgia! 75D: We’ve been seeing these SpaceX rocket liftoffs lately, and I think they do use T MINUS ZERO at the end of the countdown; T equals time in this phrase. This clue made me think of a wonderful old radio show, “X Minus One,” that’s available now in podcast form. A quick Google search didn’t elucidate what these two terms have in common, in case anyone knows. The seed for this puzzle (and its original title) was “Sunrise, Sunset” — with the eastern theme entires featuring a rising S-U-N, and the western ones featuring a setting S-U-N. It was important to me that none of these entries — whether the across ones or the down answers containing SUN — use that letter string to mean the word “sun.” This was a bit harder than expected! You may notice that I broke a fairly rigid crossword rule in that the theme entries are not symmetrically placed, but it would have been near impossible to do so, given that they each span several rows. I did try to put them in approximately symmetrical locations, for consistency’s sake. Because the themers take up a lot of real estate in both across and down directions, filling this grid was a beast. This is the third draft I submitted, and while I wish there were a bit more room for the grid to breathe, I think it’s free of dreck (REE being the only real gross entry, IMO). Phrases like SUNK COST, PROM DATES, REAL TALK, NERF WAR, and MIC DROP are fun bonus fill. I tried for way too long to get YASQUEEN at 11D (it really almost worked for a long time) but finally let it go when it came at the expense of too much bad fill. I’m quite happy that my original clue on I SEE IT made it through; it feels much more in-the-language than previous methods of cluing that entry (variations of [Response to “Look over there!”]). In general, I like to make my puzzles contemporary and conversational, which I think I’ve accomplished here. Lastly, I’m honored to have a puzzle run on the Sunday of ACPT for the second time!

2018,Football’s Brain Injury Crisis Lands in Family Court,"PITTSBURGH — In this city with a deep and proud relationship with football, a custody dispute has pushed the debate about the sport’s safety into a new arena: family court. A father, John Orsini, has gone to court to prevent the youngest of his three sons from playing high school football because, he said, scientific studies have revealed the perils of repeated blows to the head — especially for an athlete, like his son, who has a history of concussions. The boy’s mother, Mr. Orsini’s ex-wife, believes he should be allowed to continue playing because he understands the risks. “You always heard it sometimes, when one parent would say I don’t want him doing that because he might get hurt,” said Allan E. Mayefsky, a leading divorce lawyer and the former president of the New York chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. “Usually, we thought the parent was just overprotective. Now, it’s more of a real medical issue.” In the decade since scientists began to link football to long-term brain damage, the debate over the future of the sport has moved from research laboratories to the halls of Congress, to locker rooms and owners’ suites. Families, too, have grappled with the question of how dangerous the game is — and now parents’ concerns are surfacing in legal battles between divorced couples, leading to an increase in fights over whether to amend custody orders to prevent their children from playing the game. It is impossible to say precisely how many disputes over football are occurring in family courts. Most records are sealed and disputes often settle before they go to trial. But Joe Cordell, the founder of Cordell & Cordell, which specializes in divorce law, said that about a third of the 270 lawyers at his firm, which is spread across 40 states, said that they have seen an increase in custody battles over whether a child should be allowed to play football. In some parts of the country, football has replaced hockey as the sport at the center of custody battles, other lawyers said. Most of the disputes over football are occurring in states where football remains very popular, like Texas, Oklahoma and Ohio, places Mr. Cordell described as “heavy football states.” In states where football appears to be on the wane, including those in the Northeast, disputes are less common because both parents have already decided that the game is too dangerous for their child to play. One of those football-heavy states is Pennsylvania, where Mr. Orsini, a musician and former lawyer, went to court last summer to prevent his youngest son from playing tackle football. The case will likely result in a trial. Like many fathers of his generation, Mr. Orsini, 66, was for years an enthusiastic supporter of football. He played the game in grade school and rooted for the hometown Steelers. He enrolled his sons in youth tackle football leagues when they were as young as 5 years old, including his youngest son. Mr. Orsini said he attended their practices and games, including in the years after he and his ex-wife, Janice, divorced in 2004. Their oldest son, Giuseppe, who is now 21, plays football at Case Western University in Cleveland. Mr. Orsini’s view of the game changed when his youngest son, 17, sustained three sports-related concussions. The first was in 2013, when he was hit in the head with a metal baseball bat while not wearing a helmet. He took a battery of tests at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and, after several weeks, was allowed to resume playing sports. The second and third concussions were in 2015 and 2016 during football games. Orsini said that afterward, his son was sensitive to light and noise, experienced headaches and was lethargic. His son, he recalled, sat slumped at the table during meals. Again, within a few weeks, doctors cleared him to return to play. Orsini said that when he asked the doctor whether his son should stop playing football, he was told there was no medical evidence that he should cease playing. “The moment for me started when he repeatedly got diagnosed with concussions and the doctors kept telling me there was no reason for him to not keep going,” Mr. Orsini said. Having worked as a plaintiff’s attorney, he was alarmed. “His mother didn’t question the doctors, but in my profession it is an impossibility.” Mr. Orsini said he was surprised that his son’s doctors appeared to be sanguine about the dangers of the sport. So he began doing his own research and found, among other things, studies by researchers at Boston University that said that boys who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 had more behavioral and cognitive problems later in life than those who began playing the sport in their teenage years. Mr. Orsini said he tried unsuccessfully to discuss these findings with his ex-wife. Mrs. Orsini declined to be interviewed. But her lawyer, John N. Demas, said she considered her son, now a junior in high school, mature enough to understand the risks of the game and to make up his own mind. She also felt reassured that her son’s coaches were well-trained at spotting and caring for concussed players, and that doctors had declared him free of symptoms from the concussions. “The truth is, this young man loves to play football and understands the dangers, and based on the science now, his mom thinks the benefits are worth the risks,” Mr. Demas said on behalf of Mrs. Orsini. Mr. Demas added: “Where we are with the science of it, I don’t know if there is enough evidence to say it’s inherently dangerous.” Mr. Demas said that the Orsinis have joint legal custody of their son, and that Mr. Orsini’s attempts to block their son from playing football amounted to one parent acting unilaterally. In seeking to alter their custody agreement, Mr. Demas said, Mrs. Orsini was only trying maintain the status quo. “We’re not asking for carte blanche,” Mr. Demas said, “we’re only asking for authority on this decision of whether he can play.” In late July, just before his son was to start practicing for his junior season, Mr. Orsini told his school that he did not want his son playing. He had joint legal custody, so the school complied. “I cannot speak to an individual student’s circumstance, but generally in custody disputes, the terms are spelled out and we follow them,” said Patrick O’Toole, the superintendent of the Upper St. Clair School District, about 10 miles south of Pittsburgh. “If there’s a dispute, the parents tell us what to do.” The case then moved to family court. In early August, Mrs. Orsini filed an emergency request to let her son play, as he had for more than a decade. Mr. Orsini argued that while he had supported his son’s right to play for years, he was now aware of new, worrying research about the safety of the game. “Playing football cannot be considered status quo when the Child has now suffered three concussions,” Mr. Orsini’s lawyer wrote in a court filing. Common sense dictates that “the best interest and general health welfare of the Child is protected by not permitting Child to participate in football.” The judge allowed the ban to stand. But two weeks later, Mrs. Orsini filed a petition to gain “sole legal custody” related to “the child’s participation in extracurricular activities.” The judge agreed to let the boy resume playing football while she decided on whether to approve the change to the custody order. Despite a flurry of motions over the next few months, Mr. Orsini was unable to persuade the judge to stop his son from playing, and the boy completed his junior season without any concussions. The court case has strained Mr. Orsini’s already contentious relationship with his ex-wife, and his sons now rarely speak with him. The growing number of disputes over the long-term consequences of football has put family court judges in the awkward position of having to pick sides on a hotly debated issue. In most states, judges are charged with ruling in the best interests of a child’s health. In the case of sports like hang gliding or rock climbing, the dangers may be self-evident. But the science around the long-term cognitive and neurological damage caused by football is still emerging. Judges who side with parents trying to prevent their sons from playing tackle football end up endorsing the view that the sport is too risky, a stance that might be unpopular with voters who elect them. Judges who side with parents who want their son to play, on the other hand, risk being accused of not being prudent enough if the boy is injured. “I’ve had custody officers say they won’t touch the issue,” said Mark R. Ashton, a family law attorney at Fox Rothschild in Exton, Penn. “If a kid is seriously injured playing sports, the court gets blamed.” The Orsinis have entered a court-mandated mediation program, but the two sides are no closer. Their next mediation, which will be in front of the judge, is later this month. If neither side budges, Mr. Orsini said he is prepared to go to trial, an expensive and time-consuming process that will likely require, among other things, that the boy be deposed. His fear, though, is that the case will drag on until November, when his son will turn 18, and Mr. Orsini will be powerless to stop him from finishing his senior season, or from playing in college. “If I can’t stop him now, he’s on track to have a lot more damage done,” he said.

2018,"For Arthritis Pain, Nonopioid Drugs Work as Well as Opioids","Opioids are no better than nonopioid pain relievers for treating the chronic pain of osteoarthritis, a clinical trial has found. Researchers randomized 240 patients with moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis to either an opioid (morphine, oxycodone or hydrocodone) or to nonopioid pain relievers (such as Tylenol, topical lidocaine or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). The study, in JAMA, used 11-point pain and function scales to measure the effect of treatment, with higher scores indicating poorer results. This is, the authors write, the first randomized trial of opioid therapy to report long-term pain and function outcomes. At the end of 12 months, the opioid group scored an average 3.4 on the function scale, and the nonopioid group 3.3, an insignificant difference. On the pain scale, the nonopioid group did slightly better — 3.5, compared with 4.0 for the opioid group. Unsurprisingly, there were significantly more medication side effects in the opioid group than in those who took nonopioids. “Should we use opioids if nonopioids don’t work?” asked the lead author, Dr. Erin E. Krebs of the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System. She answered her own question: “No. We tried four different nonopioids — don’t give up on them too soon — and we should also be using exercise and rehab for most osteoarthritic pain.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Artists, the Thrill of Grant Money Arrives With a ‘Now What’?","For every Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons who are making millions from their art, there are millions of artists who struggle to get by. Take the Detroit sculptor Sarah Wagner, who has had what many people would consider concrete successes in terms of getting her art seen by the public. For instance, she has an exhibition of her installations, “Vegetable Lamb of America: The Art of Sarah Wagner,” on view at Michigan’s Muskegon Museum of Art through March 18. But she also has a job in construction. “Anyone who makes art, you have to figure out how to make a living, too,” Ms. Wagner said. “Very few people do that from their art.” Then in 2014, she won a $25,000 grant from the New York-based Joan Mitchell Foundation, which was established by the abstract painter. For most artists, getting a substantial cash grant is an event that can transform their creative lives. But once it’s obtained, what comes next? Should they fund a current art project or pay down debt? Should they rent a studio or buy one? Should they sit on a beach and think of great ideas or get health insurance? In other words: More money, more problems. Ms. Wagner was not sure what to do, but the foundation also helped her to get advice. The organization provides financial counseling to its grantees, a trend that is gaining traction among nonprofits that make similar grants. First, Ms. Wagner dialed into a group video conference that was arranged by Creative Capital, a nonprofit artist-focused group based in New York with significant funding from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. “I was embarrassed at the ways that I make money,” Ms. Wagner recalled of the group call. “They said, ‘No, that’s called ‘multiple revenue streams.’ It sort of took the stench off it for me.” Then she had a phone session with a financial counselor, also paid for by the Mitchell foundation. In the end, Ms. Wagner took the grant and “spent it on living, and didn’t make much art,” she said. “I had a pause.” But she said that not only did it fuel her creative juices — directly leading to her current museum show — she used the time to learn bookkeeping skills, which had previously bedeviled her. Now, her finances are better organized. The Mitchell foundation started the counseling program after the last recession. “A recipient of one of our awards came to us, and she was having cash-flow issues,” said Christa Blatchford, the foundation’s chief executive. “She said, ‘I need counseling.’ We had never given it before, but I realized it was irresponsible of us not to.” The foundation has given more than 1,000 grants to artists since 1994, and the awards for painters and sculptors are generally $25,000, though they offer the option of taking the money over two years. Ms. Blatchford said that the counseling the foundation helped arrange focused on “things that would make them feel successful.” But she added that financial counseling was not for everyone: “Some people show up, but they zone out — they aren’t ready.” While many arts organizations give grants for specific projects, rarer is the unrestricted grant, and the open-ended quality is the very thing that has brought financial counseling to the forefront. As Deana Haggag, the president and chief executive of United States Artists, said, “Our money is different.” The organization, based in Chicago, gives unrestricted grants of $50,000 to up to 50 artists every year. “My dad asked me before I took this job, ‘Do you know what you’d do with $50,000?’” said Ms. Haggag, who started as president last year. “I had no idea.” So Ms. Haggag is studying how the group can counsel artists on how to use the money. “Hopefully in a year, it’s a regular service,” she said. The group’s annual assembly in March, which gathers together the new fellows, will include, for the first time, a group session on managing money. You can’t underestimate what artists — or anyone else — knows about finances, said Edward P. Henry, the president of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and a member of the United States Artists board of trustees. The Duke foundation is a major donor to United States Artists, part of its annual giving of more than $100 million a year, some of which goes to separate artist grants. “When you receive an award, maybe it’s unrestricted, but it’s still taxed,” Mr. Henry said. “You’ll receive a 1099. And you have a Schedule C to legitimately deduct the cost of your materials. This is all Step 1.” United States Artists announced its new class of fellowships in January, and two of the recipients were Cauleen Smith, a Los Angeles filmmaker, and Pepón Osorio, a Philadelphia installation artist. Both have received other awards: Ms. Smith won the Herb Alpert Award in the Arts for $75,000, and Mr. Ossorio received about $300,000 from a MacArthur Fellowship, also known as a “genius grant.” How the two artists talk about their plans demonstrates the variety of approaches — perhaps to be expected, given the personal nature of making art. “I’m a nice middle-class kid,” Ms. Smith said. “You’re taught to save, save, save. What I’d really like to do is invest in a building that could be a studio and generate some income. But this is L.A. — 50k won’t buy me a mailbox.” She noted that she had considered seeking financial counseling in the past, but the advisers “only want to deal with really wealthy people.” Mr. Osorio, 63, acknowledged that his likely path is probably not one a financial adviser would endorse: He is planning some travel that involves investigating and preserving the legacy of his earlier work. “When people think of a big chunk of money, they think of their future,” he said. “But I think of the future of my practice.” The MacArthur Fellowship, which he received in 1999, went straight into works like “Tina’s House,” a collaborative project that involves video and sculpture. Mr. Osorio added, “Most likely I will plan everyone else’s retirement before I plan mine.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Austin Bomb Investigators, Each New Blast Offers New Clues","A suspect in the series of bombings that have terrorized Austin, Tex., died early Wednesday, blowing himself up in his vehicle as officers closed in on him, the authorities said. Read the latest updates here. AUSTIN, Tex. — The serial bomber who is terrorizing Texas’ capital has not officially communicated with investigators. Yet, in some subtle ways, the bomber is doing just that with each explosive-rigged package that is found. Law enforcement officials investigating one of the most brazen and deadly serial explosion cases in America in decades are struggling to read his bombs for any clues they can find. So far, five homemade explosive devices planted in packages and near sidewalks have detonated in Austin and near San Antonio this month, killing two people, wounding five. On Tuesday morning, a sixth bomb, this one unexploded, forced the shutdown of a FedEx facility near Austin’s airport. Hours later, the authorities said, an old military device donated to a Goodwill store went off in an employee’s hands at a strip mall south of downtown, injuring a man in his 30s and setting off another scare in a city on edge. But officials determined it was not related to the earlier package bombings. Officials have launched a sweeping manhunt, both forensic and physical, for the bomber, whose identity and motive remain unknown. “It’s such a random sending of these bombs,” said Nelson W. Wolff, the top elected official in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. “You’ve got somebody out there, or possibly more than one person, that’s obviously got a system going, and that doesn’t mean it couldn’t be changed from one town to the other.” The explosions — the fifth was at a FedEx center near San Antonio early Tuesday morning — do not destroy evidence of the bombs’ origins so much as blast it into many bits and pieces. DNA and other more technical fingerprints can remain. Switches, relays and homemade circuit boards often survive. If the explosive was contained in a pipe, then the inside walls of that pipe, even in tiny fragments, will be smudged with residue from the explosive it held, experts say. While investigators have been tight-lipped about the details of the case, bomb experts and federal agents described an intense detective drama unfolding throughout Central Texas. The F.B.I. confirmed Tuesday night that the two latest packages located at FedEx facilities near San Antonio and the Austin airport were connected to the earlier explosions. With six devices now tied to the case and no arrests yet, panicky residents have flooded 911 with more than 1,200 suspicious-package calls since March 12. Still, with every new bomb discovered, the evidence grows and, investigators hope, the space between the hunter and the hunted narrows ever so slightly. Specialists from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who are working the case have honed their skills, and their eyes, for years. The A.T.F. has long run a five-day “post-blast investigator” course for law enforcement around the country. Typically, once the classroom portion of the course has ended, the agency will blow up a car on a demolition range using a real car bomb, and the students will comb the range afterward for parts and pieces of the device that exploded. At the scene of the first package explosion in Austin, a red brick house on Haverford Drive in northeast Austin where the first victim, Anthony Stephan House, 39, was killed, a large chunk of the white-painted wall next to the plywood-covered front door has been removed, probably by investigators who want to recover minuscule bomb fragments from it. “The Unabomber put ‘FC,’ which stood for Freedom Club, on his bombs, so the investigators will be looking for any signatures that could give them some investigatory leads,” said Clinton R. Van Zandt, a former profiler with the F.B.I. who worked on the case. The bomber, Theodore Kaczynski, was a mathematics professor turned recluse whose crudely fashioned bombs killed three people and injured 24 others over a 17-year period beginning in 1978. One new potential block of evidence emerged on Tuesday from the Austin bomber’s use of FedEx. The package that exploded shortly after midnight Tuesday at the FedEx center in Schertz, outside San Antonio, was shipped from the Austin area and was bound for Austin as well. Another suspicious package discovered on Tuesday also was shipped via FedEx, and it, too, contained explosive material, a law enforcement official said. Both packages were mailed from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley, a small city within Austin, and a statement from FedEx suggested that they were sent by the same person. The second package was turned over intact to law enforcement, marking the first time investigators will get their hands on one of the serial bomber’s unexploded devices. They may also be able to get video images of the person who shipped it. “We have provided law enforcement responsible for this investigation extensive evidence related to these packages, and the individual that shipped them, collected from our advanced technology security systems,” FedEx said in a statement. Tuesday illustrated the shifting, fast-paced tempo of the case. Austin police called in a bomb squad at the FedEx center near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, where the unexploded package was found. The facility remained sealed off hours later as police and federal agents continued hunting for clues. “We are still investigating,” Austin police spokeswoman Destiny Winston told reporters at the scene. In the span of 18 days this month, the case has unfolded at five explosion sites in two cities, and prompted neighborhood lockdowns in Austin and operational disruptions at three FedEx facilities. The explosion at the FedEx site in Schertz, which caused a worker to complain of ringing in the ear, signaled yet another shift in tactics for the bomber. The first three devices were in packages that were left on doorsteps, but the fourth was triggered by a tripwire strung across a sidewalk. The fifth was the first to have been shipped. Investigators have said the bomber had to possess some level of skill to build and transport devices without them blowing up prematurely. It appeared that the blast on Tuesday represented, for the bomber, a premature detonation. Homemade package bombs delivered to homes and offices have become surprisingly common. Since 1990, dozens of men, women and children have been wounded or killed in package bombings around the country, in explosions that were not connected to the Unabomber case. The culprit, in many of those cases, was an ex-husband, an ex-boyfriend, a stalker or a relative seeking revenge or an inheritance. The frequency of the attacks illustrates just how easy it has become for a person with no explosives training to make and deliver a package bomb. According to A.T.F.’s most recent public report on bomb incidents, there were 439 bombings in 2016, up from 400 the year before. In January 2000, in the Boston suburb of Everett, Sandra Berfield, a 32-year-old waitress, was killed after she opened a package containing a pipe bomb that was left on her doorstep. A handyman who had stalked her for years, Steven S. Caruso, was convicted in her murder. The authorities said he used a readily available toy rocket-launcher component in his bomb. He had put her sister’s return address on the package to make sure his target opened it. A string of bombings this month have put Austin, Tex., on high alert. In Austin, investigators may have more clues to work with than the bomb-maker might expect. “A bomber often believes that the device itself is consumed in the thermal effect of the blast, and that he is giving himself distance from the criminal act,” said a federal agent and explosives expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “They think they have autonomy, but they don’t.” Investigators now are going so far as to reconstruct the bombs that exploded, using similar materials. “Each one of these devices is being rebuilt to help investigators figure out what they are looking for,” the federal agent explained. “It is like putting a puzzle together.” Ed Davis, the former Boston police chief, who has been involved in investigating several bombings including the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, said rebuilding the bombs was critical in that case. “It helps them determine the sophistication of the device and the level of expertise involved in building it,” Mr. Davis said. “Then it limits the number of people you are looking at. It provides a certain class of possible suspects.” Bomb experts and those who study serial killers said the search for clues is time-consuming and complex, but far from impossible. Some said it was clear that the Austin bomber had already built the devices in advance before launching the first attack, because the use of different triggering mechanisms takes time. Others said the suspect or suspects had shown a major vulnerability: By dropping off the packages themselves or shipping them at FedEx, they exposed themselves or their vehicles to being captured on surveillance video or seen by witnesses. Then there is the shrapnel. The first four devices that exploded in Austin contained shrapnel — small metal pieces like nails that are included in a bomb to make it wreak more havoc on people who are nearby when it goes off. “Shrapnel is critical to this analysis,” said Mr. Van Zandt, the former F.B.I. profiler. “If investigators look at the shrapnel from all five devices and see the same kind of nails or ball bearings, for instance, that would connect the devices to the same bomb builder. Investigators could then canvass hardware stores in Austin, or all over Texas for that matter, looking for someone who bought quantities of these things.” The locations of the explosions is also significant. All of the four bombings in Austin occurred in residential neighborhoods near highways and major thoroughfares, suggesting to investigators that the suspect may be doing significant getaway planning and may not even live in Austin. Investigators have sought home security camera footage that could help solve the case. Law enforcement officials have taken the unusual step of speaking directly to the suspect or suspects at news conferences, asking them to call 911 to talk to the police and explain the message behind the attacks. Mr. Van Zandt said that for some serial bombers, such an invitation may be hard to resist. But he added that there was another benefit to such communication between the hunters and the hunted. “If we give them an opportunity to talk, they are not bombing,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"For Casual Indian Restaurants, It’s Party Time","Critic’s Notebook Some new restaurants you just know are going to be copied like Chanel handbags. I was fairly sure, for instance, that New York’s dining future was full of backless stools, long waits, chicken-liver toasts and precisely engineered pub burgers after one meal at the Spotted Pig. I’ll admit, though, that when Babu Ji showed up on Avenue B in the summer of 2015, I had no clue it would turn out to be a template for Indian restaurants in the city. The blanketing sweetness that covered up the spices in several dishes caused me to write the place off. I should have looked more closely; I should have asked myself why tables were so hard to come by. But I didn’t. Babu Ji closed less than two years later, after two wage-theft lawsuits were filed against the owners, and that, I thought, was the end of that. So much for my second career as a clairvoyant: The lawsuits were settled, and Babu Ji was resurrected at another address, near Union Square. Meanwhile, over the past year I’ve been eating, often very happily, in a number of new Indian places in Manhattan that are casual, not too expensive, and reminiscent of Babu Ji in one way or another. I think of them — Rahi, Badshah, Old Monk and aRoqa — as the Baby Ji restaurants. Some borrow menu items without, thankfully, emulating the original’s sweet tooth, which persists at its second location. What ties them together, and what I think will be Babu Ji’s legacy, has less to do with cooking than with finding a style of casual, inexpensive dining that’s in tune with current sensibilities. They’re learning to create atmospheres and present cooking in ways that resonate with a modern audience, the way Hanjan and Atoboy have done with Korean food or Atla does with Mexican. This is not an issue for the city’s fancier Indian restaurants, such as Indian Accent, Junoon or Tamarind Tribeca. Manhattan has a long tradition of formal Indian restaurants, often overseen by cooks who learned to present their country’s cuisine in a fine-dining idiom by hard-core training in India’s extensive system of hotel kitchens. At the other end of the scale are the no-frills places where value makes style irrelevant. The middle ground, though, is ripe for the Baby Ji rebellion. In retrospect, it should have been obvious that the source of Babu Ji’s popularity is the way it mimics a big, informal dinner at a friend’s house. Its owners, Jessi Singh and his wife, Jennifer, project gloriously hallucinatory Bollywood numbers on the wall. You’re encouraged to “help yourself” to beer from a refrigerator case in the dining room. (Fear not, this will be recorded on your check.) On top of the refrigerator is a stuffed peacock. Gallery-quality framed photographic portraits of Indian men set the geographic theme without falling into cliché. The food, overseen by Mr. Singh, is dressed for a party: The kitchen is fond of tossing flowers, sprouts and other garnishes on dishes that would otherwise be a study in browns. None of the second-generation places go quite as hard as Babu Ji. But there is Hindi hip-hop at Badshah, in Hell’s Kitchen, along with a spray-painted mural of tigers and skyscrapers by Carl Joseph Gabriel, and drinks served in canning jars. At Rahi, in Greenwich Village, surreal and cartoonlike figures by the street-art duo Yok and Sheryo crawl along the walls, and there’s more high-energy work in the back from a New Delhi gallery of emerging Indian artists. Flowers and sprouts are rampant. Over in Chelsea, aRoqa is the most cosmopolitan of the bunch, with moody cocktail-bar lighting and a swooping ceiling of bent wooden slats. The chef, Gaurav Anand, lightens the mood by serving rice-and-corn cakes in the luggage compartment of a tiny carrier tricycle. Dry ice makes an appearance, as do squeezable syringes, for injecting various chutneys into molded drums of paneer. Needless to say, there will be flowers. Old Monk, which took over Babu Ji’s original space in the East Village, is decorated with a different set of photographic portraits of men. This time they are monks from around Asia; one is taking a picture and another is holding a smartphone to his ear. The beer fridge is gone, but there is a long beer list, drawn from the more mainstream wing of the craft-brewing movement, like Fat Tire, Flying Dog, etc. (The wine list takes more chances.) One of Babu Ji’s more clever innovations is offering a $62 fixed-price package of dishes as a tasting menu. It’s not a true tasting menu in the style of, say, Blanca, but the term has cachet with modern diners, who end up trusting the kitchen to choose what turns out to be a well-rounded, traditional family-style meal. Old Monk has kept this idea, in a $55, four-course dinner called You’re in Good Hands. I didn’t try it, because my head was turned by the rest of Navjot Arora’s menu: fine pork-stuffed Tibetan momos with a ferocious garlic-chile sambal; tandoori lamb chops marinated in rum and ginger; a slow-cooked dal of mixed lentils that is inspired by Sikh temple cooking and is very delicious. Badshah’s chef, Charles Mani, used to cook at Babu Ji, and even claims to have come up with its General Tso’s Cauliflower, a spin on the classic Chinese-Indian fried cauliflower in chile sauce. In his new job, he calls it Badshah Cauliflower. I’ve eaten just one quick dinner at Badshah so far, and while I was content with the Kashmiri-style goat curry, I was less thrilled by the refrigerator-cold sauces spooned over hot potato croquettes. The most exciting food in this group, I think, belongs to Rahi. Chintan Pandya, the chef, trained under chefs from the Oberoi hotel group, and comes to Rahi from Junoon, where he was executive chef. The cooking isn’t as consistent from night to night as it should be, and Mr. Pandya can sometimes follow his creative impulses right over the cliff; my initial skepticism about tandoori lamb chops smeared with wasabi did not melt away when I tasted it. More often, the flavors are vivid and unexpected. With a chaat of fried artichoke hearts and edamame in a fruity and sour sauce of tamarind and pomegranate molasses, Mr. Pandya showed that he could infuse non-Indian ingredients with flavors that are very true to Indian cooking. There is a captivating appetizer of dark-meat chicken in a basil-chile sauce called Tulsi Chicken, and an inexplicably good snack of Melba toasts under chopped shishito peppers mixed with melted Amul cheese, a processed and highly shelf-stable product that’s everywhere in India. And I’m slightly in awe of his tandoori skate, a pristine hunk of fish cooked so it just slides off its cartilage and coated with a yogurt sauce so rife with cinnamon and cloves that it tastes like A.1. Sauce that some gifted cook had improved almost beyond recognition. Over the weekend, I went to a new place that in some respects fits right in. The Bombay Bread Bar is a quick conversion of Floyd Cardoz’s SoHo restaurant Paowalla. I don’t have the nerve to call it a Baby Ji, though. Mr. Cardoz practically invented fun, casual, inexpensive Indian dining years ago at the old Bread Bar, below Tabla, and he brings some of his old tricks to his new place. But I can’t help noticing that the menu is easier to scan; that the cooking, as good as ever, has moved toward small, colorful plates; that the prices stand firmly in the middle ground; and that the drab, businesslike design of Paowalla has been engulfed by paper marigolds, fruit-patterned oilcloths and a mural painted in comics style by the Pakistani-raised Canadian artist Maria Qamar. I’m not quite sure what it depicts, but it looks like a pair of Bollywood actors. aRoqa 206 Ninth Avenue (West 23rd Street), Chelsea; 646-678-5471; aroqanyc.com.

2018,"For Cuomo and Nixon, a Rush to Secure Black Votes Early","Not long after it became clear that Cynthia Nixon would challenge Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the Rev. Clinton Miller, who leads a mostly black, 1,200-member congregation in Brooklyn, received a call from a close associate of Mr. Cuomo’s asking if the governor could speak at his church. The answer was a swift no. Mr. Miller said the governor’s office had not been responsive enough to community concerns like contracting for minority- and women-owned businesses. Mr. Cuomo wound up finding an audience at black churches each of the last two Sundays — rare back-to-back appearances for him at the pulpit. In between his visits, Ms. Nixon formally declared her candidacy, making her first appearance in Brownsville, Brooklyn, speaking before a mostly black audience in one of the poorer neighborhoods in the city. And she gave her first formal interview to the oldest black newspaper in the country. The Democratic primary for governor may be less than a week old but the battle between Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Nixon for the African-American vote is already underway, underscoring the importance of a voting bloc where Ms. Nixon’s own advisers acknowledge she must make inroads to have any chance at victory. Privately, Mr. Cuomo’s team has been blitzing the cellphones of politically connected African-American pastors and elected officials in recent days. Publicly, he has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with black and Latino residents and decried the state of public housing in New York City as a “civil-rights abuse.” Ms. Nixon, an education advocate and actress best known for her role in “Sex and the City,” has also personally been reaching out to community leaders, knowing she must crack Mr. Cuomo’s hold on the black vote. He scored 77 percent support in the race’s first poll among African-American voters. Black leaders in clergy, politics and the media are well aware of the courtship and savoring their newfound leverage. “We’re free agents,” said the Rev. Johnnie Green Jr., the pastor of Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem, who hosted Mr. Cuomo on Sunday after he said he rejected a request the week before to introduce the governor at a sister church. “We’re like LeBron James in the hotel room waiting for the phone to ring.” Senior administration officials say the governor’s recent activity has nothing to do with Ms. Nixon and everything to do with the state budget, due next week, where the governor is seeking to mobilize black support for some of the thorniest remaining issues, including on public housing and school funding. Mr. Cuomo has appeared at black churches during past budget seasons. Mr. Miller, the pastor of Brown Memorial Baptist Church, said that after he hung up with Mr. Cuomo’s team, he sent text messages to another 30 black pastors across New York City to ask that they not reflexively acquiesce. “I requested that they think carefully about hosting the governor until he becomes responsive to our concerns,” Mr. Miller said. Mr. Cuomo has had a complex relationship with black leadership in the state dating back to his first failed run for governor, in 2002, when he challenged H. Carl McCall, then the state comptroller who was seeking to become New York’s first black governor, for the Democratic nomination. But in recent years, black voters have provided him a bulwark of support. Mr. Cuomo’s last challenger, Zephyr Teachout, never penetrated Mr. Cuomo’s political standing in minority communities. She finished with an abysmal 14 percent of the vote in the Bronx. “Clearly, Cynthia Nixon understands that if she can’t break through Andrew Cuomo’s African-American firewall, she has no shot at being competitive,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, a Cuomo ally. Before she launched her campaign, Ms. Nixon gave a quick heads-up call to the Rev. Al Sharpton, the influential civil-rights leader and media figure. She also sat down privately with the Rev. Michael A. Walrond Jr., senior pastor at the 10,000-member First Corinthian Baptist Church in Central Harlem; she showed up to services unannounced the following Sunday. Bertha Lewis, president of the Black Institute and a longtime community activist, said Ms. Nixon also called her days before announcing a run to solicit her opinion. The exact minute that Ms. Nixon announced her campaign on Twitter — 2:02 p.m. last Monday — she personally texted Elinor Tatum, the publisher and editor of the Amsterdam News, the historic black newspaper, to alert her to the news. Ms. Nixon granted her first sit-down interview to the paper. “She understands how important the African-American vote is,” said Ms. Tatum. “And she is not taking it for granted.” Ms. Nixon, who also attended services on Sunday at a predominantly African-American church, Mount Pisgah Baptist in Brooklyn, is expected to follow up her call to Mr. Sharpton with a meal together soon at the famed Harlem soul-food restaurant Sylvia’s, likely at the same window table where Mr. Sharpton met separately with Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders as they ran for president. Mr. Sharpton “will weigh in after he’s met with Ms. Nixon,” according to Rachel Noerdlinger, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sharpton. Mr. Sharpton has worked closely with Mr. Cuomo on criminal justice-matters, praising him at the governor’s mansion as recently as last month. Not all of Ms. Nixon’s early maneuverings have played well. She made her first stop in Brownsville, for instance, without alerting the area’s elected officials. Alicka Ampry-Samuel, the local Brooklyn councilwoman, called it “disrespectful.” Ms. Ampry-Samuel said she still had not heard from Ms. Nixon or her team as of Friday but has spoken with the governor’s team multiple times in recent days, mostly about the state budget. In addition to his private outreach, Mr. Cuomo has appeared alongside mostly black and Latino residents multiple times this month to decry the “filth” of New York City Housing Authority developments and to threaten to declare a state of emergency for the agency. Earlier this month, the governor met with a small group of influential black leaders in Albany about education equity funding, related to a proposal he made in January. One of the attendees, Rev. Alfred L. Cockfield, II, executive pastor of God’s Battalion of Prayer Church in East Flatbush, got a call from Mr. Cuomo’s team afterward asking if the governor could appear at his pulpit. Mr. Cockfield said he knew “it was strategic” for Mr. Cuomo, and that he experienced some pushback from some Democratic elected officials, but decided to let him speak anyway. “It’s the first time any sitting governor came to our church. Why would I turn down that opportunity?” he said. The governor’s speech was about closing Rikers Island, fixing public housing and equitable education funding — all issues tuned to appeal to an African-American audience, and potentially at stake in the state budget. “It tells you he thinks there’s a vulnerability there,” said Bill Hyers, a senior strategist advising Ms. Nixon. “The governor has overwhelming support in the African-American community but that doesn’t mean he should take any African-American votes for granted,” said Charlie King, an adviser to Mr. Cuomo who has helped with black outreach, “And I know that he won’t.” Mr. Cuomo’s operation pointed to his track record for the black community, including increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour, raising the age of criminal responsibility to 18 and issuing an executive order naming the state attorney general as a special prosecutor for police-related civilian deaths. “Why in the world would we abandon him when throughout his time in office he’s never abandoned us?” Mr. Jeffries said. Some black leaders are looking for more. Mr. Green, president of a group of pastors named Mobilizing Preachers and Community, said he rejected Mr. Cuomo’s first request to introduce him at a black church a week ago in part because he is unhappy with the governor’s record on minority contracting. “Why should we continue to give him access to our pulpits?” he said in an interview earlier in the week. But as he introduced Mr. Cuomo on Sunday, he said, “Someone said wise men disagree but fools fall out.” He praised the governor for providing money to public housing and pushed him for more: “We ask Mr. Governor that you not stop there.” Mr. Cuomo swayed and clapped as the congregation sang, he hugged and kissed members of the choir and he quoted scripture three times in his speech. Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte, who has been critical of Mr. Cuomo on minority contracting, said the governor’s team has begun reaching out to her almost daily about Vital Brooklyn, a $1.4 billion proposal from March 2017 to address poverty and violence, since it became clear Ms. Nixon might enter the campaign. Another wrinkle is that Mr. Cuomo’s lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, is facing a challenge from Jumaane Williams, a black New York City councilman from Central Brooklyn. Shortly after Mr. Williams announced, it was floated that Mr. Cuomo was considering swapping Ms. Hochul for Lovely Warren, the mayor of Rochester, an African-American woman. “Governor Cuomo generally is concerned about himself so I’ve found he treats people in those positions like chess pieces,” Mr. Williams said. Mr. Cuomo has since said Ms. Hochul would be his running mate. Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president who has been critical of Mr. Cuomo, leapt into the middle of the primary last Tuesday when he requested on Twitter that Ms. Nixon tour a Brooklyn public housing complex with him. “This campaign season gives us the chance to raise these issues,” he said. It took Ms. Nixon all of 25 minutes to respond on Twitter: “I accept.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Cuomo, a ‘Personally Painful’ Conviction Also Hurts Politically","The federal corruption conviction of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s former fixer and longtime top aide on Tuesday further yoked the two-term governor to a broken culture in Albany that he has long tried to campaign against. The verdict is a nadir in Mr. Cuomo’s governorship and only the start of a political headache that is likely to intensify. The actress Cynthia Nixon has geared up to challenge him in a Democratic primary this year, and the trial of another Cuomo administration insider looms this summer. For years, Mr. Cuomo has constructed an image as a political reformer and a master manager of a dizzyingly complex state government. He declared his candidacy in front of the Tweed Courthouse steps in 2010, promising to usher in an era of change. Now, with his campaign manager from that race, Joseph Percoco, convicted on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo must concede that, at best, he did not know about the corrupt scheming occurring in the adjacent office by a man he has likened to a brother. “This is certainly not something that’s helpful,” Jay Jacobs, a former state Democratic Party chairman who is close to Mr. Cuomo, said. Mr. Percoco was found guilty of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and solicitation of bribes, with prosecutors accusing him of taking more than $300,000 from executives whose employers had business before the state. He was found not guilty of extortion. The combination of the Percoco verdict and Ms. Nixon’s emergence — she has been in talks with two veteran Democratic strategists about the race; her wife just stepped down from a job in the Bill de Blasio administration; and she was recently spotted with what appeared to be a campaign video crew — has upended what for months had appeared to be a governor on a glide path to a third term. From Albany to Washington, Republicans pounced on the conviction to bludgeon Mr. Cuomo ahead of this year’s re-election campaign and a possible presidential run in 2020. Watchdog groups called for a fresh round of reforms. Mr. Jacobs predicted that Mr. Cuomo would emerge relatively unscathed over the long term because the governor was not accused of wrongdoing. “You always have to stay the course even when waters get rough, and I think that’s what he has got to do right now,” he said. Mr. Cuomo had dodged questions about the trial for weeks, saying he was deferring to the judicial process. In the first hours after the verdict, he hunkered down in the State Capitol as reporters circled the halls outside his office. The governor eventually issued a prepared statement about the “personally painful” verdict. The governor said he would seek “additional safeguards in place to secure the public trust,” but what exactly that meant was unclear. The trial itself was a near-daily drip, drip, drip of revelations of Albany’s inner workings under Mr. Cuomo’s watch, including Mr. Percoco’s use of state offices while on the campaign; government officials’ widespread use of private emails to avoid public-record laws; and efforts to mask campaign contributions, legally, by routing them through multiple limited liability companies. And Mr. Percoco was shown to be no ordinary aide. He was the governor’s political enforcer and virtual shadow. When Mr. Percoco called, officials said, it was as if the governor himself was on the other line. The trial’s revelations have quickly shifted from the courtroom to the political realm. Standing in front of a phalanx of reporters in the Capitol, State Senator John DeFrancisco, a Republican from the Syracuse area who is running for governor, said Mr. Cuomo was either intentionally or inexplicably blind to misdeeds occurring in his inner circle. “To suggest that he knew nothing about Percoco doing these things while in his office, making 800 phone calls, is just beyond credulity,” he said, noting how Mr. Percoco had used state resources while serving as Mr. Cuomo’s campaign manager, when he was not on the state payroll. Even before the verdict was delivered, Edward F. Cox, chairman of the state Republican Party, had asked a state ethics panel to investigate Mr. Cuomo, saying the governor has violated New York Public Officers Law. He also requested an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. The verdict also reinforced a contention from good-government groups that Mr. Cuomo’s ethics record, despite some new measures, has been mostly a disappointment, from his disbanding of the Moreland Commission on public corruption to his aggressive use of campaign-finance loopholes. National Republican groups weighed in, too, trying to tie Democratic congressional challengers in New York to the conviction and what they called “Andrew Cuomo’s record of scandal.” For Mr. Cuomo, the Percoco trial was only the first this year linked to his administration. Another ally, Alain E. Kaloyeros, has been charged with corruption in a case that revolves around bid-rigging in one of Mr. Cuomo’s key upstate economic initiatives. That case goes to trial in June, the same month Mr. Percoco is scheduled to be sentenced and typically around the same time the Democratic primary for governor is getting into full swing.",The New York Times
2018,"For Heart Disease Patients, Think Exercise, Not Weight Loss","For people with coronary heart disease, losing weight will not prolong life, a new study reports, but increasing physical activity will. To their surprise, Norwegian researchers found that in some coronary heart disease patients — those of normal weight — weight loss actually increased the risk for death. The study, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, included 3,307 patients followed for an average of 16 years. There were 1,493 deaths. Lowering body mass index by more than 0.10 in a year was associated with a 30 percent increase in the risk for death, but only in those of normal weight at the start. Weight gain was not associated with mortality. Compared to patients who were inactive, those who did 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week reduced their risk by 19 percent. Those who exercised more than that had a 36 percent reduction in mortality. The lead author, Trine Moholdt, a research fellow at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said that this is an observational study and it is possible that people who lost weight were sicker than others, which might explain their increased mortality. Still, she said, “Being active has large effects, and doing even a little bit is better than doing nothing. Weight loss is beneficial for overweight people, but exercise is even better.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Many Facebook Users, a ‘Last Straw’ That Led Them to Quit","Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years. But the news that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on President Trump’s 2016 campaign, was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10,000 times on Twitter within a two-hour period on Wednesday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. On Tuesday, it was mentioned 40,398 times, according to the analytics service Digimind. Cher was one such deserter, writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook, although “very hard,” was necessary because she loves the United States. Brian Acton, a co-founder of the WhatsApp messaging service, told his tens of thousands of followers on Tuesday to delete Facebook. The social network acquired WhatsApp in a $19 billion deal in 2014. For people who aren’t celebrities or billionaires, the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly, because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives, friends and professional opportunities. Here, some newly Facebook-free users of social media discuss why they left. ______ Richard H. Perry A filmmaker in Los Angeles For a long time now, Mr. Perry had wanted to leave Facebook. He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information. In the months before the 2016 presidential election, he watched the social network become what he called “a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists.” [Read more on how to delete Facebook and Instagram.] But Facebook was also where Mr. Perry promoted his films, where he posted ads seeking help on the set, and where he communicated with colleagues and a “massive number” of his friends and relatives. Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica. “I suspected this stuff was going on, but this is the first time it’s been plainly exposed,” he said. “It seems so malicious, and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down, like it doesn’t care about its users.” Mr. Perry, 39, has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs. “It was an easy decision,” he said. “It’s not going to be the end of the world.” ______ Dan Clark A retired Navy veteran in Maine Mr. Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide. This week, he deleted both. “Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them, and it was a difficult decision to give it up,” he said. “But you have to stand for something, so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough.” Mr. Clark, 57, said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts, which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were “never evil or putting anybody down.” He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent. Before cutting the cord, Mr. Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number. More than 100 people reached out within three days. “There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact: phones, email, instant message, Gab, which is a social network that doesn’t censor anything,” he said. “Facebook is more obsolete than people would think.” ______ Alexandra Kleeman A writer on Staten Island Her first experience with fake news — a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trump’s candidacy — altered the way Ms. Kleeman looked at Facebook. “It changed the psychological and emotional feel of the platform for me,” she said. “I don’t have a great feeling when I log in.” The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone. “I’m not going to give them my engagement clicks,” Ms. Kleeman, 32, said. But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram. She doesn’t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public — she used to have a blog, she said. “But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don’t want, that freaks me out.” ______ Paul Musgrave An assistant professor in Amherst, Mass. Twitter makes Mr. Musgrave feel depressed about the world, but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon. As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Mr. Musgrave, 36, feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets. Facebook was more valuable to him as a “low-key, offstage networking tool,” a “replacement for end-of-year family newsletters” that allowed him to “passively keep up with people,” he said. He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster, a precursor to Facebook. But in 2016, while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana, Mr. Musgrave discovered a “poisonous swamp” of content on the site. The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing, he said. ""This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us, truly Big Brother-level, but it’s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication,” he said. ""That’s what’s really been scary.” Having deactivated his Facebook account, with plans to delete it, he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication. “I’m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches,” he said. “I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones, and even they don’t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces.” ______ Ben Greenzweig An entrepreneur in Westchester, N.Y. Once Mr. Greenzweig confirms that the 1,195 photos and 85 videos in his Facebook profile have downloaded, he plans to delete the account he has maintained for nearly a decade. Mr. Greenzweig, 40, said the Cambridge Analytica news was “the last straw.” “We have surpassed the tipping point, where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost,” he said. “But I will definitely miss what the promise of Facebook used to be — a way to connect to community in a very global and local context.” A year ago, Mr. Greenzweig was an “extraordinarily active” Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends, managed several groups, took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts. But on Tuesday night, in his final post, he asked his network to connect with him through email, LinkedIn, Twitter or phone. “See everyone in the real world,” he wrote. video",The New York Times
2018,"For Many Strokes, There’s an Effective Treatment. Why Aren’t Some Doctors Offering It?","It was one of those findings that would change medicine, Dr. Christopher Lewandowski thought. For years, doctors had tried — and failed — to find a treatment that would preserve the brains of stroke patients. The task was beginning to seem hopeless: Once a clot blocked a blood vessel supplying the brain, its cells quickly began to die. Patients and their families could only pray that the damage would not be too extensive. But then a large federal clinical trial proved that a so-called clot-buster drug, tissue plasminogen activator (T.P.A.), could prevent brain injury after a stroke by opening up the blocked vessel. Dr. Lewandowski, an emergency medicine physician at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit and the trial’s principal investigator, was ecstatic. “We felt the data was so strong we didn’t have to explain it” in the published report, he said. He was wrong. That groundbreaking clinical trial concluded 22 years ago, yet Dr. Lewandowski and others are still trying to explain the data to a powerful contingent of doubters. The skeptics teach medical students that T.P.A.is dangerous, causing brain hemorrhages, and that the studies that found a benefit were deeply flawed. Better to just let a stroke run its course, they say. It’s a perspective with real-world consequences. Close to 700,000 patients have strokes caused by blood clots each year and could be helped by T.P.A. Yet up to 30 percent of stroke victims who arrive at hospitals on time and are perfect candidates for the clot-buster do not receive it. The result: paralysis and muscle weakness; impaired cognition, speech or vision; emotional and behavioral dysfunction; and many other permanent neurological injuries. Stroke treatment guidelines issued by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association strongly endorse T.P.A. for patients after they’ve been properly evaluated. But treatment must start within three hours (in some cases, four-and-a-half hours) of the stroke’s onset, and the sooner, the better. A number of medical societies also endorse the treatment as highly effective in reducing disability. The drug can cause or exacerbate cerebral hemorrhage, or bleeding in the brain — a real risk. But in most stroke patients it prevents brain injury, and in any event, rates of cerebral hemorrhage have declined as doctors have gained experience over the years. Without treatment, “many patients end up permanently disabled,” said Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a cardiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The stroke neurologists who are involved in chronic care see the devastating consequences.” “For some reason, the emergency medicine doctors are not factoring this in,” he added. While the vocal disbelievers are a minority, it is increasingly easy for them to spread their message on social media, said Dr. Edward C. Jauch, a professor of neurosciences at the Medical University of South Carolina. “The way information and opinion is now communicated to the younger generation of physicians is much more through web and social media and less through peer review journals, journal clubs or live debates,” Dr. Jauch said. Dr. Charles R. Wira III, a professor of emergency medicine at Yale, said that when he talked to residents about T.P.A., they often start citing blogs and podcasts “as the divine word for why T.P.A. is harmful,” he said. “They have not read the articles or practice guidelines.” Skepticism has spread around the world, Dr. Jauch said, and he has come to expect naysayers wherever he goes. In Saudi Arabia, where he was lecturing at a conference, a Saudi doctor said over dinner that he simply did not believe in T.P.A. A leader of the skeptical contingent, Dr. Jerome Hoffman, an emergency medicine specialist and emeritus professor at U.C.L.A., believes that while the initial trial and a second one were positive, both were flawed. He reviewed the raw data from the federal study and concluded that more patients who got T.P.A. had the least severe type of stroke and fewer had the most severe type. The treatment and control groups were dissimilar — that is, those getting T.P.A. were less badly affected from the start. Experts disagree with this analysis. And 11 other studies did not show a benefit, Dr. Hoffman claims. But supporters note that those studies were meant to investigate whether T.P.A. might help patients with more severe strokes or those outside the recommended window of time. The failure of those efforts, they say, does not mean T.P.A. cannot help patients like those in the original clinical trials. A charismatic, riveting speaker, Dr. Hoffman has given educational courses across the country and many medical professionals have listened to informational tapes in which he presented his critique of the evidence. And his influence has spread. At U.C.L.A., he said in an interview, he has spoken to stroke patients and their families even as their medical teams headed into the emergency room. He has told the patients that although the stroke team would strongly recommend T.P.A., there actually was debate over whether the treatment benefits patients in the long term. In addition, no study suggested that a clot-buster was lifesaving, he told them, and it may cause bleeding in the brain in a small number of patients. “In my experience, almost no one — after hearing a neutral version and then a positive version — chose T.P.A.,” Dr. Hoffman said. Dr. Hoffman said he has debated renowned neurologists about the benefits of T.P.A. at several meetings. Afterward, audiences voted overwhelmingly against the drug. “This is not a testament to any debating skill of mine, but reflects how people react when they are shown the actual evidence,” he said. At Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo, Calif., Dr. Scott Bisheff, an emergency medical physician, tells patients there is great uncertainty about whether T.P.A. helps or harms. If it caused bleeding in a patient’s brain, the consequences could be catastrophic. About half of his stroke patients decline the treatment, Dr. Bisheff said. For neurologists, the worst scenario by far is the patient who is never even asked if he or she wants the clot-buster. At Yale, Dr. Wira said, patients sometimes are transferred from community hospitals where they have not received T.P.A. Usually, it’s far too late to try. Dr. Wira and other staff do not tell the family about the missed opportunity. “We try not to raise issues that may lead to litigation,” he said. But sometimes family members cannot help knowing what went on. It happened to Dr. Lewandowski. About a decade ago, Dr. Lewandowski was at work when he got a call that his father had had a stroke — his right side was paralyzed. But his father had gotten to the hospital within 45 minutes, well inside the window to receive T.P.A. Dr. Lewandowski told his mother to make the family’s wishes very clear. They wanted the emergency room doctor to give the clot-buster to his dad. The doctor refused. “He told my mom that he doesn’t believe in the drug and he is not giving it. He doesn’t care who I am,” Dr. Lewandowski said. “I got in my car and drove 400 miles to the hospital,” he recalled. But by the time he got there, it was too late. The treatment window had closed. His father had a facial droop and slurred speech. His right arm and right leg flopped about uselessly. His stroke scale was 7, moderately disabling, but he survived for a few more years. “It was very difficult for me personally,” Dr. Lewandowski recalled. “I had spent so much of my professional life working on this treatment.

2018,"For Panda Express Owners, It’s About Family","At the entrance to the Rosemead, Calif., headquarters of Panda Restaurant Group, the parent company of Panda Express, Panda Inn and Hibachi-San, the artist Robert Indiana’s “LOVE” sculpture was recently unveiled. The 12-foot-high multi-million-dollar installation, with those four bright red letters made of aluminum, perches atop a fountain of flowing water. It was a private donation by the company’s co-founders and co-chief executive officers, Andrew and Peggy Cherng. The sculpture’s message resonates with the Cherngs, who have spent the last 45 years building a Chinese restaurant empire that produced sales in excess of $3 billion last year, with over 2,000 Panda Express restaurants in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Guatemala, and Aruba. Those restaurants each average about 480 guests on a given day, and the Cherngs employ more than 35,000 associates. “We are building a culture on trust, and the aim of trust is love,” said Ms. Cherng, 70. “Love is the verb we emphasize with our Panda family. We must respect and care for each other. We must push and stretch each other.” Associates who work in Panda Express restaurants wear uniforms with the Chinese proverb: “Make happy those who are near and those who are far will come.” “When I saw the ‘LOVE’ sculpture, it made me think life is tough, life is difficult,” said Mr. Cherng, 70. “Life is something you really have to face squarely on. It is about overcoming the difficulty. Continuously working on improvement — that to me is the happiness, love is about that.” Although the road to success has not always been a smooth one — there have been some legal disputes with employees — the Cherng’s overall approach seems to have worked. Since 2005, the chain has more than doubled in size, with roughly 150 stores opening each year, Mr. Cherng said. And the company has had consecutive same-store-sales growth for 21 of the last 22 years. Its best-selling dish: orange chicken. This year, customers will buy an estimated 90 million pounds of the lightly sweetened fried chicken. And last year, Panda Express purchased 22 million pounds of broccoli. The Cherngs have routinely shunned opportunities to grow even faster by franchising locations, or to reap the reward for their achievement by selling shares of their company to the public. They choose to own and operate all their restaurants with the exception of a few select locations. “The motivation of going public is really a financial play,” Mr. Cherng said. “Maybe you need to raise money to open more stores, or sometimes people go public because they want to have a little bit more money. We have always been able to grow anyway.” The family-owned and operated company has richly provided for the Cherngs, who have a net worth of $3.3 billion, according to Forbes. “The beauty of not being franchised, or not being public is you have control,” said Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant industry analyst for The NPD Group’s food-service division. “You have consistency. When you have a franchise operation, even though rules are put in place, the franchisees don’t always play along. And if you are public, then you are constantly having to answer to Wall Street, and it’s a challenge.” And holding on to what you’ve built over decades has a psychological appeal. “It is a business, but it is also tied to their personal identity,” said Rob Lachenauer, a partner and chief executive officer at BanyanGlobal Family Business Advisors in Boston, Mass. “One, you are not going to sell your identity. Two, it is hard to step away from the business because you are stepping away from who you are.” Many family-owned businesses are creating a multigenerational business, Mr. Lachenauer said. “They are not a Silicon Valley start-up trying to pop something in five years and then go to the beach. That speaks to trust because of the stability of a long-term investment that most families have in their businesses. It builds loyalty with their employees.” Another upside: “When you’re a satisfied employee, you’re going to provide your customers good service,” Ms. Riggs said. “If you enjoy what you are doing, and you like management, and you are not a disgruntled employee, that is going to come across in spades to the consumer. In our industry, today, it is sorely lacking.” The Cherngs repay that trust to their employees by allowing them to run the individual restaurants, even if they do not have the full responsibility that a franchisee would have, and to hold prominent roles on the top management team. One of their three daughters, Andrea, 40, is the chief marketing officer, but there are nonfamily members in the senior ranks of the company, including the general counsel and senior vice president for international development, and the senior vice president of operations and licensing. Even with their command and control approach, however, the Cherngs’ have encountered some rough spots in employee relations. In recent years, a number of lawsuits have been filed. One, for example, was on behalf of a group of general managers who claimed that their positions were wrongfully classified as exempt from overtime; a settlement was reached in that case. In another, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged that the company was treating its Latino employees differently from Asian workers at one restaurant. In California, a suit claimed cashiers and workers did not have seating while they were on duty. And last June, Panda Express settled a claim that it discriminated against workers who weren’t American citizens. The company did not comment directly on the suits. In a statement, Ms. Cherng said, “People are the foundation for what we do and what we believe in. We practice continuous learning to understand how we can be an employer of choice, which includes additional training and systems to reinforce our core values. Our hope is to foster a relationship of mutual trust and love with our associates.” Typically the Cherngs pay their mangers well to compensate for what are typically 50-plus hour weeks, according to employee reviews on Glassdoor.com. Store associates are eligible for bonuses. General managers can make $100,000 or more with bonuses. The firm also offers a stock option program that includes dividends. The company provides subsidized health care coverage to all its employees, including part-time workers who work over 30 hours, after six months. The Cherngs attribute much of their success to their core beliefs. “Life is more than just for yourself,” Mr. Cherng said. “You want to do well for family, to take care of other people, other causes — that is where happinesses are.” That leads to another aspect of the Cherngs’ business strategy: philanthropy. The Cherngs giving over the years between all their philanthropic efforts is in excess of $83 million. Through their giving organizations — Panda Cares, the philanthropic arm of the Panda Restaurant Group, and Panda Charitable Foundation — the Cherngs give chiefly within the areas of education, youth leadership development, and health. The motivation for giving is part of their back story. “We are first generation immigrants here, and we were educated in the United States,” Ms. Cherng said. “The giving back and paying forward is very important to us.” The Cherngs came to the United States from China in the mid-1960s to attend Baker University in Baldwin City, Kan., where they met as freshmen. Mr. Cherng then earned a master’s degree in applied mathematics at the University of Missouri, and Ms. Cherng received a master’s degree in computer science and a doctorate in electrical engineering. The restaurant business, though, was in Mr. Cherng’s blood. In 1973, with the help of his father, Ming-Tsai Cherng, a chef, he opened his first restaurant, The Panda Inn in Pasadena, Calif. “For me, my biggest business challenge was going from zero to one store and surviving that,” Mr. Cherng said. “When you don’t have any money, and you aren’t making any money, whether I was going to survive or not to me was the challenge.” In 1983, when the real estate developer of the Glendale Galleria, a customer of the Panda Inn, proposed opening a quick-serve location in his mall, the Cherngs leapt on the chance. And Ms. Cherng — who had worked on the software development team for organizations such as McDonnell Douglas and Comtal-3M — went to work for the family business. “The ‘LOVE’ sculpture makes me remember my personal change,” Mr. Cherng said. “When I was younger, I was probably much more task-oriented, much more demanding. As I get older, I connect with people. I am more patient. We are in the business of developing people, we just happen to be in the restaurant business and serve Chinese food.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Parkland Students, a Surreal Journey From ‘Normal’ to a Worldwide March","WASHINGTON — Little has returned to normal for the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School since Feb. 14, when a gunman killed 14 of their classmates and three staff members. They juggle homework with activism. They wince at loud noises. Sometimes, they sleep. But to the huge crowds that greeted them in Washington on Saturday at a march to protest gun violence, the students were fearless celebrities. “We’re here for you, Douglas!” a girl shrieked as five teenage boys from Stoneman Douglas and their history teacher made their way to the main stage. “Go Douglas!” said the teacher, Greg Pittman. As the crowd broke into applause, the boys remained stoic. They held up their poster boards — “It is a school zone, not a war zone,” read one — and looked straight ahead. They were part of a group of 200 people from Stoneman Douglas, in Parkland, Fla., who were sponsored by Giffords, the gun control advocacy group, to come to the Washington march. An alumni group raised enough money to get more than 550 additional students to the rally, a spokeswoman for the group said. Others traveled to Washington on their own, some of them rooming with family and friends. Despite their numbers, their steady presence in the news, their unmistakable influence on the national debate over guns, some of them were trying to be teenagers again. It hasn’t been easy. The five boys did not organize the event on Saturday, called the March for Our Lives. They did not lose a relative in the shooting. They were not injured. Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world. But their coach, Aaron Feis, was killed. Their school was forever changed. And now, they were in the nation’s capital, feeling hundreds of eyes on them as they walked down Constitution Avenue. “There’s a lot of emotion,” said one, Adrian Kauffman, 16. The five boys, all sophomores, refrained from endorsing a specific policy proposal or calling out politicians they dislike. They arrived to show strength in numbers, “so nothing like this happens again,” said Adam Hostig, 15. “Most teenagers talk about drama about girlfriends and boyfriends,” said Zach Cooper, 16. “And we’re talking about bomb threats and guns.” “Nonstop,” Adam said. A police helicopter hovered overhead. Adam’s eyes darted up suspiciously. “Even coming to an event like this, it’s scary,” Zach said. None of them paid much attention to the politics of guns before the shooting, they admitted. “We got more informed,” said Evan Kuperman, 16. The march will make it “feel like the people who died did not die in vain,” added Josh Funk, 16. Amid their newfound activism, they have tried to return to lives that resemble those they had before their high school turned into a mass-murder scene. “You get a sense of guilt trying to have fun,” Josh said. “But at the same time, you just want to be with friends and family all the time. To never miss a moment.” In Washington this week, the Florida visitors sponsored by Giffords went to museums and shared late-night ice cream sundaes in a hotel ballroom with foosball tables and a Pac-Man machine. But they also roved the hallways of the Capitol, meeting with lawmakers and lobbying for action on gun violence. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, dropped in on their hotel. Some of them met former Vice President Joe Biden. “I’ve gotten about nine hours of sleep in four days,” Aly Sheehy, an 18-year-old senior, said near midnight on Friday. “But being around other people that understand what I’ve gone through just recharges me.” “On Sunday, we’ll all be exhausted,” she added. “But then we’ll go back. For something this important, I’ll make the time.” “They definitely think we’re going to go away,” Jose Iglesias, a 17-year-old senior, said of politicians and skeptical adults. “We know what we’re doing. We have tactics. They think we’re just children.” The students knew that interest in their cause might fade outside their own schools. They knew that for the grown-ups, the march, which was organized in a little more than a month, might seem like the culmination of their efforts. “It’s just the beginning,” Jose said. On Saturday morning, he awoke early. “In my sleep, I called 911,” he said. “Really it was my alarm that kept going off.” “I have flashbacks of running into a classroom,” said Sarah Pierre, 17, a senior. Over breakfast, students made last-minute signs with Crayola markers. Natasha Martinez, a 17-year-old junior, got on FaceTime with her mother, who was attending the march back home in Parkland. Her mother worried that Natasha was underdressed for the Washington cold. “I’m wearing the thermal, a turtleneck, this hoodie I bought, and a coat,” Natasha insisted. A friend sitting next to her, Isabel Chequer, a 16-year-old junior, waved at Natasha’s mother. “She has a special pass,” Natasha said, pointing at Isabel’s neck. “Injured club!” said Isabel, who was twice grazed during the shooting. She was one of 17 people hurt. Isabel fears the shooting will make it impossible for her to watch action movies anymore, despite her interest in film. “I feel like I can’t see those movies again, like ‘Black Panther’ or ‘Annihilation,’ which makes me really sad, because I love movies so much,” she said. “It’s taken a little bit from myself.” “I feel weird doing normal things,” her schoolmate Aly said. Throngs of marchers soon took to the streets downtown. Students from Stoneman Douglas and other schools delivered speeches, some choked with emotion as they described living with violent memories, survivor’s guilt and the ever-present shadow of fear. Samantha Fuentes, an 18-year-old senior who was shot in both legs during the shooting, went on stage to read a poem. Halfway through it, she appeared to get nervous and quickly ducked behind the podium. She stood back up as people rushed from backstage to help her. “I just threw up on international television, and it feels great,” she said with a laugh, before reading the rest of her poem. It ended: “Will you give up? Or is enough enough?” When the speeches — along with performances by Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and others — were finished, and the crowds began to disperse, the Stoneman Douglas students became tourists again, albeit ones who had moved thousands. Amanda Lee, a 17-year-old junior who had been in one of the classrooms where shots were fired, left the rally with other students, pausing to snap pictures of the cherry blossoms that had started to bloom along the street. Amanda said she had expected more of an actual march than speeches and a concert. But the magnitude of what they had accomplished in less than two months, she said, hit when she saw images of protests across the country and around the world. “It sinks in,” she said. “And then you feel that you’ve done the impossible.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, a Royal Wedding. For the Rest of Us: Royal Tours","the getaway With the couple’s nuptials on the horizon, travel brands are offering themed hotel packages and viewing parties. With the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle mere weeks away — and the recent news that the couple will have a carriage procession around Windsor Town after their nuptials at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle — hotels and tour companies are trotting out packages for royal watchers. In Britain it’s easy to create your own royal-inspired itinerary with, say, a riverboat ride on the Thames and a visit to Windsor Castle (though note that the castle will be closed on May 18 and 19). From London to Windsor, there will be wedding-themed tea parties, and plenty of bars and pubs from which to watch the festivities (they are widely expected to be televised) and celebrate into the night. In Windsor, the wedding day carriage procession route from St. George’s Chapel will be via Castle Hill, along High Street and through Windsor Town, and then back to Windsor Castle along the Long Walk, according to the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead tourism site. You can preview the procession route in this video from the tourism association, Visit Windsor: But for those who want to go a step further, there are royal wedding packages at hotels and, should you prefer to relish the big day with fellow fans, group tours. Among the most comprehensive is the eight-day Royal Wedding Celebration in England: Inside the British Monarchy tour from Road Scholar, the experiential learning travel company. The tour (from $2,499, excluding airfare) includes an indoor hotel-viewing party with picnic food as well as stops at the Tower of London, Kensington Palace, Westminster Abbey, Hampton Court Palace and Windsor Castle, as well as talks from former royal staff members about how to organize a security team of thousands of people, and the art of creating a royal cake. The Original Tour, which has long offered open-top, hop-on hop-off bus tours of London, has begun, for the first time, operating daily bus tours of Windsor, just months before the royal wedding. The bus passes places such as Windsor Castle, Eton College (attended by both Prince William and Prince Harry) and the Royal Farms Windsor Farm Shop (a 24-hour period ticket is £13, or about $18; £7 for children; £11 for students and adults over 60; £33 for a family with two adults and two children; free for children under 5). There are a variety of day tours to be had in and around London. If you’re considering signing up for one on May 19, be aware that in general, day tours that regularly visit Windsor Castle will not be visiting the castle that day. Companies like Evan Evans, for instance, which typically offers a day tour with stops at Windsor Castle, Stonehenge and Bath, will visit Hampton Court Palace, the former home of Henry VIII, on that day instead of Windsor Castle. The same is true for Golden Tours, which leads a Windsor Castle, Bath and Stonehenge tour but on the 19th will also visit Hampton Court Palace rather than Windsor Castle. Many leading Windsor hotels are already booked that day, though properties nearby and in London are selling royal-inspired getaways. You can even find a vacation rental promising the occasional wedding-themed amenity. “If you are coming during the Royal wedding, there will be a complimentary Champagne hamper provided to help kick off the celebrations,” read one Airbnb listing for a home in Windsor. At the Arch London boutique hotel, the Royal Wedding package, available throughout May, is £3,900 for a two-night stay based on double occupancy and includes a two-bedroom suite; a three-course dinner at the hotel’s restaurant, Hunter 486; a Champagne breakfast; and afternoon tea. The package includes a tour of Windsor Castle (not available on May 18 or 19) and a £100 shopping voucher to Fortnum & Mason, the tea and gift shop. At One Aldwych in London, there will be a Royal Wedding Celebration Package on weekends in May, with rooms starting at £355 a night. For an additional £45, you can order a “royal bouquet” with peonies (reported to be a favorite flower of Ms. Markle, according to the hotel) and a sprig of myrtle (often used in royal brides’ bouquets since the 1800s). The Hotel Café Royal is offering a Regent Royal Wedding package from April 1 to June 21 (with a minimum stay of two nights), which includes accommodations in a suite; a limousine tour to Windsor Castle to visit the Chapel and The State Apartments; a picnic hamper for your day out; a royal wedding memorabilia gift; and an English breakfast, among other amenities (from £2,000). Not posh enough? You can stay in the hotel’s Empire suite with the Empire Royal Wedding package (with a minimum stay of three nights), which includes all of the above as well as additional amenities such as a helicopter tour of London and tickets to the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, from £6,500 a night. While the wedding is to take place in Britain, that isn’t stopping hotels in the United States from partaking in the festivities. Among them, the Drake, a Hilton Hotel in Chicago, is offering a “Film and Fondue” series Monday nights in May with movies such as “The Queen,” “Elizabeth — The Golden Age,” and “Victoria and Abdul” (starting at $25 a person plus taxes and tips). There are royal-themed sweets, snacks, teas and bar specials (10 percent of the proceeds from beverages on the Royal Cocktail Menu in May will be donated to Prince Harry’s endorsed charity, the Invictus Games Foundation). And, on the wedding day itself, the hotel is planning a screening of the royal festivities and, in the grand ballroom, a luncheon that was once served to Princess Diana during her visit to the hotel in 1996. ($100 for priority seating; $80 for general assigned seating; taxes and gratuities included. Reservations are required.)",The New York Times
2018,"For Sloane Stephens, Run to Final in Miami Brightens the Mood","MIAMI — Sloane Stephens was trying to get ready. Busy choosing an outfit to wear for her day-after-U.S-Open-championship photo shoot in New York last September, Stephens barely heard the knock at her hotel room door. Assuming the intruder was room service, Stephens cheerily called out, “Come iiiin.” When she realized, instead, that her visitor was the star point guard for the Houston Rockets, Stephens, a newly-minted Grand Slam champion, simply blurted out, “You’re Chris Paul.” It turned out that Paul’s mother, Robin Jones, had followed Stephens’s unlikely run to the title and become a Stephens fan. Paul, a nine-time N.B.A. All-Star, happened to be staying in the same hotel as Stephens and wanted to meet her. During their visit, he even got his mother on his phone so she could FaceTime with Stephens. “That was super awesome,” Stephens recalled Thursday afternoon, just after she reached the Miami Open final. “I mean, I love him, and I got to meet his mom. It was so cute.” Celebrity encounters like that are the kind of perk that Stephens still marvels over when she thinks back to her Open win. But they also helped her get through a rough post-Open patch — from last fall through the Australian Open in January — when she lost eight straight matches. It is easy to smile about the good times again, now that Stephens, who defeated the former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka on Thursday to reach the Miami final, is having her best tournament in months. But it hasn’t always been this much fun. During her victory drought, Stephens lost four matches on a WTA tour-mandated Asian swing and then dropped both of her singles matches while representing the United States in the Fed Cup final in Belarus. One of those matches, an 8-6 third-set defeat to Aliaksandra Sasnovich, left her in tears. “My heart was there and I really wanted to play because I was super excited about playing again,” said Stephens, who had missed the first half of 2017 after surgery on her left foot. “But physically I was not anywhere near where I wanted to be, and that’s just what you get when you’re not 100 percent healthy. I wanted to be there mentally but my body was like, ‘No, girl, have a seat.’ “That just turned into people saying how I’m such a flop and I’m never going to be the same,” added Stephens, who was ranked No. 83 when she won the Open, becoming only the fifth unseeded champion in tournament history. “It was crazy, but people just don’t know what’s going on. I mean, they have no idea.” Stephens, who turned 25 last week, is back in a final for the first time since Flushing Meadows and, win or lose, she will reach the top 10 in the WTA rankings for the first time on Monday. Not only did she beat Azarenka for the second time in a month — she also scored a second round-victory in Indian Wells, Calif. — but Stephens also upset the reigning Wimbledon champion, Garbine Muguruza, in the round of 16 and another former world No. 1, Angelique Kerber, in the quarterfinals. Stephens will face last year’s French Open champion, sixth-seeded Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia, in the final on Saturday, the last time the tournament will be contested on Key Biscayne, near Stephens’s Fort Lauderdale home, before it moves north next year to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. The 20-year-old Ostapenko, now at career-high No. 5 ranking, was No. 64 entering last year’s Miami Open. That was before she upset Romania’s Simona Halep in Paris to become the lowest-ranked player (at No. 47) and first unseeded woman to win at Roland Garros. Ostapenko and Stephens have never played a tour match against each other, and both are seeking their first title this season. Ostapenko won a tournament, in Seoul, South Korea, last fall. That, and the French Open, are her only two career titles. Stephens has won five, including in Auckland, Charleston and Acapulco in 2016. But both are defending majors, and major ranking points, this summer, so they realize the importance of adding the Miami Open to their résumés. And both are keenly aware that winning one major does not make a career, even if it still feels special. The U.S. Open trophy that Stephens was awarded last September, for example, now holds a coveted place in the middle of the dining table in her grandparents’ home in Fresno, Calif. Why, Stephens was asked, is her most treasured prize not in her own home? “Everything that is special or important to me I keep at my grandparents’ house,” she said, a big, toothy smile emerging from beneath her baseball cap. “That’s because they appreciate it as much as I do.”",The New York Times
2018,"For Starters, Snoop Dogg and Neil Gorsuch","Mini-Vows Dr. Rachel Mirabel Shively and Leigh Gareth Llewelyn were married March 10 at the Edson Keith Mansion, an events space in Sarasota, Fla. William H. Pauley III, a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, officiated. Dr. Shively, 34, is a medical toxicology fellow for Northwell Health, a hospital system based in Manhasset, N.Y., and an attending physician in emergency medicine at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Elmhurst, Queens. She graduated from Northwestern, and received a medical degree from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. From 2011 to 2013 she was a clinical scholar working on vaccine development at Rockefeller University, funded by a National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Science Award. She is the daughter of Susan M. Burkhalter and Curtis A. Shively of Bethesda, Md. Mr. Llewelyn, 33, is a lawyer at Lankler Siffert & Wohl in Manhattan. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of South Florida. He also received both a master’s degree in English and a law degree, summa cum laude, from Duke. From 2013 to 2014 he was a clerk for Neil M. Gorsuch, now an associate justice on the Supreme Court but then a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver. The groom is the son of Helen T. Lewis of Bradenton, Fla., and the late Gareth B. Jones, who lived in Capel Iwan, Wales. In October 2012, Mr. Llewelyn was intrigued by Dr. Shively’s OkCupid profile, which mentioned that while interning for former President Barack Obama’s 2004 Senate campaign she blasted a rap song by Snoop Dogg so loudly on her headphones that Mr. Obama stopped to ask what she was listening to, and in turn she asked him his favorite Snoop Dogg album. “I told her I had a similar conversation with Mitt Romney,” Mr. Llewelyn recalled with a laugh about the message he wrote back to her: “He said his favorite album was ‘Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$.’” Although Mr. Llewelyn’s conservative political leanings did not mesh with her strongly-liberal ones, his fictitious one-upmanship, humor, as well as his height appealed to her. “I have a preference for tall men,” Dr. Shively said. “I’m 5-2, and he’s 6-2. ” After a message and a text, Dr. Shively, who described herself as “not the type to fuss around,” agreed to meet him a couple of days later at Linen Hall, a bar off Union Square, and was relieved he was unfazed when she showed up 20 minutes late. “I was chatting up some old ladies at the bar,” he said, adding, “She was worth the wait,” and he soon realized “she has sort of a loose grasp of time.” They shared drinks, brussels sprouts and high-adrenaline stories — hers of the emergency room, and his from six years of working as a 911 operator and rescue diver with the Police Department of the City of Holmes Beach, Fla. They kissed good night after he walked her to the Astor Place subway station — he lived in Battery Park City and she on the Upper East Side — and a couple of weeks later the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy did not stand in the way of a second date at the Dead Poet bar in the West 70s. “The first big part of the journey I walked through Wall Street,” he said. “It was a ghost town. It was like a-last-man-on-earth kind of movie. I was able to get a cab on 30th Street. This time, I was 20 minutes late.” They began dating seriously, and soon got around to having lively political debates. “We’re both passionate about politics,” Dr. Shively said. “It’s a bane and a boon. We share core values. We’re not too different that we can’t relate to one another.”",The New York Times
