2017,Trump Tweets He Was ‘Saddened’ by ‘Bad’ Emmy Ratings,"President Trump had international affairs on his mind Tuesday morning. In his speech before the United Nations, he threatened to “totally destroy North Korea.” He lambasted the Iran nuclear deal. And he proclaimed that parts of the world “are going to hell.” But by late Tuesday night, Mr. Trump was focused on other things. He pulled out his iPhone to deliver a 139-character tweet for world consumption: “I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night — the worst ever,” Mr. Trump began. It was really only a matter of time before the president chimed in on the Emmy Awards. Politics dominated the event on Sunday night — both in the types of shows that won and the topic of the host Stephen Colbert’s opening monologue and the winners’ speeches. Mr. Trump has expressed his displeasure with Emmys in years past, calling them rigged and dishonest. And the first minutes of Sunday’s broadcast seemed almost designed to goad the president to respond. Mr. Colbert noted that Mr. Trump was once part of Hollywood. “And we all know the Emmys mean a lot to Donald Trump,” Mr. Colbert said in his monologue. “Because he was nominated multiple times for ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ but he never won. Why didn’t you give him an Emmy? I tell you this. If he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn’t have run for president. So in a way this is all your fault.” Mr. Colbert added soon after: “What really matters to Donald Trump is ratings. You’ve got to have the big numbers. And I certainly hope we achieved that tonight.” And then in the first surprise of the night, Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, rolled onto the stage behind a lectern like the one immortalized by Melissa McCarthy in her portrayal of him on “Saturday Night Live.” “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” said Mr. Spicer, mocking his similar pronouncement in January about the crowd size at Mr. Trump’s presidential inauguration. It turned out that Mr. Spicer was wrong on both occasions. The Emmys on Sunday were watched by 11.4 million people, according to Nielsen data — about the same as last year, which was the lowest ever. Mr. Trump never won an Emmy for his reality television show, but he got close on Sunday. The actor Alec Baldwin won for his impersonation of the president on “Saturday Night Live.” “I suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,” Mr. Baldwin said.",The New York Times
2017,"Trump Waives Jones Act for Puerto Rico, Easing Hurricane Aid Shipments","The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would temporarily waive a century-old shipping law for Puerto Rico that officials there said was hindering disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Maria. The waiver of the law, known as the Jones Act, comes as federal and local officials report more supplies trickling onto the increasingly desperate island. But the Trump administration remains under pressure to step up the recovery effort. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced the decision on Twitter on Thursday morning, saying that President Trump had authorized it after a request from Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico. “It is an act of justice. It will allow Puerto Ricans to rebuild and to have a cost of living that really frankly is affordable,” Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, said on CNN on Thursday. Several members of Congress had requested the waiver earlier in the week, saying it would facilitate delivery of food, medicine, clothing and other supplies to the island, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria. The decision was made by Elaine Duke, the acting head of Homeland Security, and comes after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis determined that doing so would be in the interest of national defense, according to a Homeland Security spokesman. The waiver will be in effect for 10 days. Here’s a brief guide to the law, why Puerto Rico wanted it waived, and where the disaster relief effort stands. Governor Rosselló and federal officials on Thursday said that more fuel, food and flights were beginning to reach the island. Increasingly desperate people have spent hours lining up outside grocery stores, banks and gas stations, only to sometimes leave with nothing. Amid widespread shortages of basic necessities, Mr. Rosselló and federal officials said they were setting up 11 regional centers to distribute aid to devastated towns that were all but cut off from the outside. Federal officials said these centers had received two million liters of water and almost one million meals, and more was in the pipeline. A main challenge has been getting supplies out of Puerto Rico’s ports and to people who need food and water. Governor Rosselló said that 689 of Puerto Rico’s 1,100 gas stations were now open, but lines at many still stretch for a quarter-mile and people spend entire days to fill up a few plastic jugs with fuel for their cars or generators. He said that more fuel was arriving, and that officials were working to get truckers to transport fuel and other supplies. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, known as the Jones Act, requires goods shipped between points in the United States to be carried by vessels built, owned and (mostly) operated by Americans. Its goals were twofold. First, it was intended to support a national maritime industry that could mobilize for war or a national emergency. Second, it was intended to protect American control over local waterborne commerce. Those opposed to the act have long included officials and allies of Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico, who say that the law increases shipping costs for goods from the mainland, which are then passed on to consumers. Its supporters include pro-defense groups and members of the domestic shipping industry whose interests it protects. Some criticized calls for the suspension, arguing that it was not clear how much good it would do and that delivery delays were being caused by problems moving goods inland, not importing them. In a Monday letter to the head of the Department of Homeland Security, eight members of Congress asked for a temporary waiver of the act, arguing that lifting it would expand access to food, medicine, clothing, building supplies and oil needed for power plants. “Puerto Rico can’t borrow funds and they are required to use American shipping only, which is the most expensive in the world. In their hour of need, Washington can help by suspending the Jones Act,” one of the letter’s signatories, Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois, said in a statement at the time. A day later, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, voiced his support for the effort. “It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster,” he said on Tuesday. Mr. McCain, long an advocate for repealing the law, most recently advanced legislation to do so in July. He renewed his call for repeal on Thursday after the waiver was announced. Waivers are issued by the Department of Homeland Security, typically at the request of shippers unable to find United States vessels to shuttle their cargo or at the request of other federal agencies. A waiver can be granted only if it is in the interest of national defense and only if there are enough United States vessels available to meet national defense needs. Shipping costs or humanitarian needs are not part of the consideration, officials said. Alternatively, a request in the interest of national security may be granted automatically if it comes from the secretary of defense. The Jones Act was most recently waived weeks ago, in response to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. On Sept. 8, Ms. Duke granted a temporary waiver at the request of the departments of Defense and Energy. That decision, she said, would make it easier to ship petroleum products, including gas, diesel and jet fuel, from New York, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Texas, to Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and Puerto Rico. The one-week waiver was ultimately extended through Sept. 22. That waiver was granted about two weeks after Harvey first made landfall and just days after Hurricane Irma clobbered the Caribbean. Thursday’s waiver was issued eight days after Hurricane Maria first made landfall in Puerto Rico. Before that, a waiver had not been issued since December 2012, when one was granted to ease the delivery of petroleum products after Hurricane Sandy, according to the department. video",The New York Times
2017,Trump Wants to Repeal Obama’s Climate Plan. The Next Fight: Its Replacement.,"WASHINGTON — President Trump failed again this week to fulfill his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health plan. Now he is taking aim at Mr. Obama’s central environmental legacy, the Clean Power Plan. The administration has made clear its desire to repeal the Obama energy plan. But what would take its place remains a mystery. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected in the coming days to reveal its strategy for reversing the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants across the country. Yet while Mr. Trump has declared the Obama-era plan dead — “Did you see what I did to that? Boom, gone,” he told a cheering crowd in Alabama recently — industry executives say they expect that utilities could still be subject to some restrictions on carbon emissions. “I would be surprised if repeal did not lead to replacement,” said Paul Bailey, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. If the E.P.A. does open the door to a new, weaker set of rules that utilities and others favor, it will most likely touch off a legal battle with environmental groups and pose a bureaucratic challenge to an agency where critical senior positions remain vacant. It could also force the agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has rejected the scientific consensus that human emissions cause climate change, to implicitly acknowledge that greenhouse gases harm human health and that the E.P.A. has an obligation to regulate them. “There’s an internal debate over what the overall approach toward greenhouse gases should be, and it’s hard to formulate policy if you haven’t come to terms with the outcome of the debate,” said David M. Konisky, a professor of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University. The parallels between the Clean Power Plan and the Affordable Care Act go only so far. The health care law, which was passed by Congress, offered a tangible benefit to many Americans and was firmly in place when Mr. Trump entered office. The Clean Power Plan, a regulation, not legislation, has not taken effect and is tied up in a federal appeals court. But environmental activists and conservative opponents alike say both cases show that demanding a policy be repealed is easier than making it happen. Finding a replacement is even harder. “From the perspective of advocacy and political strategy, I think there’s a lot of similarities. Members of Congress campaigned for six or seven years to fully repeal Obamacare, and there were no conversations about replace, or nothing of substance,” said Christine Harbin, vice president of external affairs at Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group. Of the Clean Power Plan, she said, “It may be difficult to fully repeal.” The Clean Power Plan aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants 32 percent below 2005 levels and required each state to develop carbon-cutting plans. Enacting the regulation was considered vital to helping the United States reach its commitment to reduce emissions under the Paris agreement. Mr. Trump has said he intends to withdraw from that accord. The United States Chamber of Commerce, coal companies and most Republican lawmakers strongly opposed the regulation. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March to eliminate it, fulfilling a campaign promise to end what he denounced as a job-killing regulation. Over the past several months, though, some of the very people who advocated killing Mr. Obama’s climate policy have told Mr. Pruitt that his agency should devise a new, albeit weaker, rule to regulate carbon emissions in its place. Leading industry groups — including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, and utility lobbies like the Edison Electric Institute — have pressed the administration for a replacement. “We didn’t always see eye-to-eye with the last administration on how to deal with climate in the regulatory space,” said Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, which joined 28 states to challenge the Clean Power Plan in federal court. “But we’re comfortable with having a policy, even a regulation, that addresses climate change. It’s about getting the regulation right.” In public, industry leaders say their companies already are on a greener trajectory. Behind the scenes, they also worry that simply killing the climate rule would not hold up in court, and would invite even tougher regulations under a future Democratic president. They are advocating a narrow regulation that allows utilities to reduce pollution at individual plants, like substituting fuel or improving the efficiency of furnaces. Dan Byers, the senior director for policy at the Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute, said it’s important that the E.P.A.’s repeal opens the door to such a replacement. Without one, he said, the agency would be vulnerable to lawsuits for not regulating carbon dioxide. Extremely hot days are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades, potentially disrupting our everyday lives. “The uncertainty that would be associated with that is far more risky than having a rule in place which is reasonable, achievable and cost-effective,” he said. The E.P.A. declined to answer questions about the repeal process. “We don’t comment on rules undergoing interagency review,” Amy Graham, an agency spokeswoman, said in a statement. If Mr. Pruitt moves to replace the Clean Power Plan, it could signal that he intends to abandon a larger fight to challenge the essential underpinning of federal climate policy. The so-called endangerment finding, adopted after the Supreme Court found in 2007 that greenhouse gases are a pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, declares that such emissions may “reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” Mr. Pruitt has been under pressure from people who reject established climate science to challenge the determination, but a chorus of more pragmatic voices inside the administration and industry have insisted that doing so would be a legal morass with an uncertain outcome. Myron Ebell, a climate denier who led the E.P.A. transition team for the Trump administration, said he still hoped to see Mr. Pruitt challenge the endangerment finding in the future. That could happen through a series of debates on climate science that Mr. Pruitt has described as a “red team, blue team” exercise. In the meantime, Mr. Ebell said he was confident the Clean Power Plan would crumble and said the failure of Republicans to upend the Affordable Health Care was a lesson for Democrats: Pass legislation. “If you want to make something durable, you better get a law passed by Congress,” he said. “What one president can do by pen and by phone another president can undo by pen and by phone.”",The New York Times
2017,"Trump Welcomes Najib Razak, the Malaysian Leader, as President, and Owner of a Fine Hotel","WASHINGTON — When President Trump welcomed Malaysia’s prime minister, Najib Razak, to the White House on Tuesday, he thanked him for “all the investment you’ve made in the United States.” Mr. Trump did not single out Mr. Najib’s patronage of his hotel two blocks from the White House, but he could have: the Malaysian leader was spotted entering and exiting the Trump International Hotel, with his entourage, on Monday and Tuesday. The White House denied that Mr. Najib had picked the hotel at Mr. Trump’s behest. “We certainly don’t book their hotel accommodations,” the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “so I couldn’t speak to the personal decision they made about where to stay here in D.C.” Whatever the motivation, the choice of lodgings added to the awkwardness of a meeting already replete with ethical questions. Mr. Najib is under investigation by the Justice Department, part of a corruption scandal that critics said he has fended off by firing investigators and dismissing negative news reports about him as “fake news.” In these respects, he is not unlike Mr. Trump. So it was perhaps not a surprise that the two leaders skipped a news conference, kept their public remarks brief, and stayed on the safe ground of trade and counterterrorism. “We’re talking about trade – very large trade deals,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Najib, during a photo opportunity before they met in the Cabinet Room. “Malaysia is a massive investor in the United States in the form of stocks and bonds.” A grateful Mr. Najib replied, “We come here with a strong value proposition to put on the table.” He talked about buying Boeing planes and General Electric jet engines but did not mention that he had just come from the Trump hotel. Behind closed doors, the prime minister urged the United States to put pressure on neighboring Myanmar — including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of the elected civilian government — to stop the systematic persecution of the Rohingya, its minority Muslim population. Mr. Trump, a senior administration official said, expressed anger over the military crackdown and discussed ways to pressure authorities in Myanmar. There are no current plans for Mr. Trump to call Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, this official said, but he did not rule out a future conversation. American presidents have long done an awkward dance with the leaders of Malaysia, a Southeast Asian country that is a valuable trading partner and dependable counterterrorism ally of the United States but is ruled by a corrupt, entrenched Malay elite. That tension is even more acute with Mr. Najib, who is under investigation by the United States and others for an estimated $3.5 billion that investigators believe he and his associates diverted from a Malaysian government fund that he headed. Among other things, the money was used to buy jewelry, real estate and the rights to Hollywood films. The White House insisted that the Justice Department inquiry had no relevance to the meeting and would not figure in the conversation. “That investigation is apolitical and certainly independent of anything taking place tomorrow,” Ms. Sanders said on Monday. But the White House did move a picture-taking session from the Oval Office, denying Mr. Najib the customary photo with the president before the fireplace, under George Washington’s portrait. Before their meeting, Mr. Trump credited Mr. Najib with cutting off business ties between Malaysia and North Korea. The Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, has served as one of the hubs for North Koreans seeking to buy or sell nuclear-related technology or trade weapons. Relations between the two countries ruptured after Malaysia accused the North Korean government of assassinating Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of Kim Jong-un, in a bizarre attack at Kuala Lumpur’s international airport. Each country temporarily barred the other’s nationals from leaving. “He does not do business with North Korea any longer, and we find that to be very important,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Najib presented a detailed list of purchases and investments – with dollar signs attached – that seemed tailored to Mr. Trump’s balance-sheet emphasis in dealing with other nations. Malaysia, he said, had committed to buying 25 Boeing 737’s and eight 787 Dreamliners for its national airline. In addition, Mr. Najib said, one of Malaysia’s largest pension funds planned to invest between $3 billion and $4 billion in the Trump administration’s effort to rebuild American infrastructure. And another sovereign wealth fund planned to increase its existing $400 million investment in Silicon Valley. “Great,” Mr. Trump interjected, each time Mr. Najib reeled off a figure. For Mr. Najib, who faces an election and has been under unrelenting pressure at home, the meeting qualified as a major victory. It demonstrated to critics that he could travel to the United States without fear of being detained. For Mr. Trump, the payoff was less obvious. Administration officials view Malaysia as a counterweight to China and say it has been steadfast in the fight against the Islamic State. But the president broke arguably the strongest bond between the two countries when he pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade pact that includes Malaysia. Mr. Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, once praised Mr. Najib as a reformer and played golf with him in Hawaii in 2014. But after the cloud of corruption allegations took hold, Mr. Obama only met the Malaysian leader at regional conferences. Last year, when the two were together at a summit meeting at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif., Mr. Najib did not earn a repeat invitation for golf with Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump, however, seems comfortable with Mr. Najib, a suave figure who speaks impeccable English. In 2014, they played golf at Mr. Trump’s club in Bedminster, N.J. Mr. Trump gave his guest a photo of the two of them, inscribed, “To my favorite prime minister.” Mr. Trump has not hesitated to meet with autocratic leaders — or leaders with legal problems. He invited the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, to the White House, despite what critics said was his record of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug dealers. Still, human-rights advocates criticized this meeting because of the signal they said it would send. “It’s a strange meeting,” said John Sifton, the Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Clearly, President Trump has repeatedly shown that he is willing to host authoritarian leaders. But this meeting, in some respects, marks a new low. Najib has been engaged in a broad crackdown against journalists, civil society, even cartoonists.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump and AIDS,"Letter To the Editor: “In Africa, a Glimpse of Hope for Beating H.I.V.,” by Tina Rosenberg (Fixes column, nytimes.com, Sept. 19), rightly notes that President Trump’s proposed budget cuts to global health assistance would have subverted gains to end the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic. Though Mr. Trump’s proposal to reduce funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, by $1 billion was rejected by both the House and the Senate appropriations committees, the administration’s version of the global gag rule — which is a dramatic expansion of previous iterations — remains in effect. Research by Fordham University shows that the global gag rule drastically curtailed community-based H.I.V. testing and condom distribution programs. This is why President George W. Bush explicitly exempted Pepfar funding from the policy. Mr. Trump’s decision to include Pepfar and expand the global gag rule’s reach underscores this administration’s gross incompetence when it comes to global health. Now is not the time to stymie efforts to control the spread of an epidemic that knows no borders. Legislation like the Global HER Act is a critical step to making sure that progress toward ending AIDS is not reversed.

2017,Opinion | Trump and Arctic Drilling,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Interior Dept. Proposes Drilling Within Arctic Refuge, Angering Environmentalists” (news article, Sept. 17): In June 2016, five fellow veterans and I were fortunate enough to visit the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Over the course of two weeks, we canoed the Canning River for a hundred-plus river miles to the Beaufort Sea. Since I left the Army, the refuge and our spectacular public lands have provided me with a space to rediscover myself and my purpose. With the recent announcement that the Interior Department is trying to open the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge to seismic exploration, I must share what I witnessed there. The one-time seismic exploration that was completed in 1985 in the coastal plain caused lasting damage. Three decades later, the otherwise pristine landscape remains scarred with seismic trails that stretch for miles across the tundra and cut through the heart of America’s last truly wild frontier. I call on all Americans to join me in defending this fragile place from the Trump administration.

2017,Opinion | Trump and Castro Can Save Venezuela,"Op-Ed Contributor After months of clashes with the security forces, street demonstrations in Venezuela have calmed down, but the economic and political crisis is far from over. The fraudulently elected National Assembly is drafting a new Constitution that will subordinate the judicial system and legislative bodies to the executive branch. The result will be a new dictatorship in Latin America — the first in decades. Having grabbed virtually total power to govern at will, President Nicolás Maduro has wasted no time in jailing political opponents, resorting to torture and repression against students, and silencing the remaining critical news media outlets. Despite a humanitarian disaster leading his country’s citizens to lose on average up to 10 percent of their weight, to be told to eat pet rabbits and to flee abroad by the hundreds of thousands, Hugo Chávez’s successor refuses to step down. Other countries in the region and the internal opposition must intensify their efforts to find a way out of the chaos. Talks in the Dominican Republic between officials from Mr. Maduro’s government and its opponents will not succeed by themselves. On Monday, President Trump hosted a dinner for the presidents of Brazil, Colombia and Panama and the vice president of Argentina at which they agreed to continue working together to resolve Venezuela’s problems. They might achieve something, but only if another country is brought into the equation: Cuba. Given Mr. Trump’s animosity toward the Cuban regime in his United Nations speech on Tuesday, when he said Washington will not lift sanctions on Havana until it makes reforms, it may seem an unlikely partnership. But both countries have real incentives to work together: Only the Cubans can ease Mr. Maduro and his henchmen from power, and only United States’ investment, tourism, trade and good will can allow Cuba to solve its serious economic problems. If Raúl Castro joins in, a deal could be struck, now or when the crisis takes another bad turn. Mr. Maduro refuses to step down. While the government has scheduled regional elections for mid-October, Mr. Maduro is unwilling to call a presidential election next year, because he knows he will lose. International pressure on Venezuela has increased. Latin American countries have made powerful statements against the regime, and the United States has imposed sanctions; the European Union may soon impose economic and visa sanctions. But these measures alone are unlikely to bring about change in Venezuela, which makes the counterintuitive involvement of Cuba and the United States all the more attractive. Why should Washington and Havana play a role in extricating Venezuela from the mess it is in? First, Cuba has on occasion been helpful in key civil strife negotiations, most recently in Colombia’s peace agreement. Second, the only external power with any real influence in Caracas is Cuba. With more than 40,000 Cuban doctors, teachers and intelligence and security personnel in Venezuela, the Havana government enjoys Mr. Maduro’s complete trust. He relies on it for his own security, to influence his allies and to control his rivals and adversaries. In exchange, Cuba is paid in hard currency for the human resources it provides along with subsidized, though decreasing, supplies of crude oil for Cuban consumption as well as for resale at a higher price to other countries. In short, the Cubans are the only actors in this quagmire who can influence Mr. Maduro and persuade him to step aside. The opposition and the United States must be persuaded to grant Mr. Maduro and his closest cronies safe haven in Havana. This would prompt presidential elections in Venezuela and a reconciliation process with amnesty for all Venezuelans. Why would Cubans push Mr. Maduro to leave? They know that though he has weathered the latest crisis, there are many more to come: debt default, slipping oil production and prices, unrest in the armed forces. Cuba has bet the store on other countries in the past and knows well that the results have not been great. And Cuba has a huge problem just to its north with no visible solution: Donald Trump. With his election victory, Havana lost all of its contacts in Washington. Mr. Trump’s revisions of President Barack Obama’s executive actions to normalize relations with Havana are more fig leaves for Cuban-American legislators than actual threats to Cuba, but they are achieving a secondary effect: dissuading United States and European businesses from investing in Cuba. Cuba wants American tourists, but it needs certainty and continuity to attract investments that could make its economy grow. Without Mr. Trump, that is unlikely. Is there room for a quid pro quo in all of this? Would Havana help ease out Mr. Maduro and facilitate the restoration of Venezuela’s democracy if Mr. Trump were to pursue Obama-style normalization? What if countries like Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico were to replace Mr. Maduro’s oil subsidies for a time and the tens of thousands of Cuban foot soldiers in Venezuela were to be guaranteed a gradual and safe return home? It’s hard to say, but everyone would benefit from such a deal, and none of the parties involved would lose excessively. Venezuela has a lot to gain from a grand bargain including Cuba and the United States, but so do Cuba, the United States and the rest of Latin America. At the moment, it might seem naïve to think that Mr. Maduro and his allies would accept a deal in which he leaves power just as he appears to have consolidated it. But sometimes that is the best moment to reach an agreement. Venezuela’s situation is untenable, and the Cubans, who have been around forever, know that. Does Mr. Trump?",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump and the Iran Nuclear Deal,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Keeping Deal, Trump Signals a Shift on Iran” (front page, Sept. 15): President Trump, driven by a deep desire to undo everything President Barack Obama achieved, combined with a visceral animosity toward Iran, seems bent on undoing this agreement. Even when Iran is certified to be in compliance and Mr. Trump reluctantly stays with the deal, he cannot resist adding new sanctions. He thus challenges Iran to respond, which is what he no doubt wants. If he just dedicated himself with the same drive to reaching a comparable agreement with North Korea, he could potentially have the greatest accomplishment of his presidency. He should only be so lucky to have such a success, but given his preference for threats and bluster, he does not even contemplate the possibility. ELLEN S. HIRSCH, NEW YORK",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump and the Racial Pay Gap,"Letter To the Editor: Re “College Does Not Close Racial Pay Gaps” (editorial, Sept. 20): One powerful tool to combat the persistent wage gap that continues to suppress the economic mobility of women and minorities is transparency. In 2016, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission approved a transformative measure to collect summary pay data by race, ethnicity and sex from employers to learn where pay gaps persist and how to correct these injustices. In a truly transparent fashion, the commission solicited significant public input, including from employers. Yet now this effort to shine a light on pay disparities is being undermined by the Trump administration, which last month decided to stop the pay data collection. Our organizations submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to get answers from the Trump administration as to why it suspended the E.E.O.C. initiative.

2017,"Trump at U.N. Talks Up, but Does Not Press, Mideast Peace","News Analysis UNITED NATIONS — President Trump will try to play the peacemaker in his first appearance at the United Nations General Assembly this week, but not on the issue that American presidents have historically spent their energy and prestige on at diplomatic gatherings like this. Rather than seek to revive the moribund peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians – as his predecessor, President Barack Obama, did at his first General Assembly – Mr. Trump is likely to wade back into the internecine feud between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbors. Mr. Trump’s focus on the Gulf over the Levant attests to the chronically dismal conditions for an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, but also to the diminishing role that the peace process plays in the geopolitics of the Middle East and to this president’s other priorities in the region. “If they want to solve the problem, they’ve got to get a negotiation going” with the Israeli and Palestinians, said Martin S. Indyk, the special envoy for Mr. Obama’s last effort to broker a deal. “Unless Trump is prepared to bang some heads together there’s not much for him to do in this situation.” While Mr. Trump has clung to the hope for peace – he raised it again before meeting on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel – he has put much more time into cementing alliances with the Sunni Muslim kingdoms of the Persian Gulf, as a way of confronting Iran. That makes the festering squabble in the Gulf a more urgent headache for him than the decades-old enmity between Israelis and Palestinians. Ten days ago, Mr. Trump’s effort to settle the dispute, a three-way phone call with the leaders of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, ended in failure. He is meeting later this week with the Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, as well as with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who is also a party to the dispute. Administration officials said Mr. Trump was likely to keep trying to close the rift. “Middle East peace is desirable because it’s the mother of all diplomatic deals,” said Robert M. Danin, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “But the conflict that’s taking place in the Gulf is harming U.S. interests in a more immediate sense.” The allure of a history-making peace accord is still strong, as Mr. Trump’s remarks with Mr. Netanyahu illustrated. While the Israeli leader kept his focus on “the terrible nuclear deal with Iran,” Mr. Trump spoke expansively about a peace agreement as though it was a genuine possibility, somewhat to the Israelis’ surprise. “It will be a fantastic achievement,” the president said. “We are giving it an absolute go. I think there’s a good chance that it could happen. Most people would say there’s no chance whatsoever.” But Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm bore little resemblance to the actual diplomacy underway here. American officials have gone out of their way to lower expectations for the General Assembly. They do not plan to push either the Israelis or the Palestinians to meet or to present any new ideas for breaking the deadlock between them. Nor will Mr. Trump bring Mr. Netanyahu together with the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, for a three-way meeting, as Mr. Obama did in September 2009. “This is very early stages,” said Brian H. Hook, senior policy adviser to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. “We shouldn’t expect major breakthroughs or detailed proposals quite yet.” Mr. Hook said Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu devoted an “equitable” amount of time to the peace process, but much of their conversation had to do with the nuclear deal and how to counter Iran’s aggressions in Syria and elsewhere. In recent days, the United States and Iran have waged a war of words over the nuclear deal, accusing each other of violating it in spirit, if not in practice. Mr. Netanyahu fiercely opposed the agreement and is still stoking opposition to it. The contrast to Mr. Obama’s first General Assembly was vivid. He used the meeting to deliver a kick to a process that he felt was lagging after his first eight months in office. After meeting with each leader individually, Mr. Obama presided over a reluctant joint handshake between them. “We cannot continue the same pattern of taking tentative steps forward and then falling back,” an impatient Mr. Obama declared. “Success depends on all sides acting with a sense of urgency.” To underscore his point, Mr. Obama singled out his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and special envoy, George J. Mitchell, and said he was directing them to build on the momentum achieved at the United Nations. Ultimately, Mr. Obama’s effort ended in failure. Mr. Trump named his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and one of his lawyers, Jason D. Greenblatt, to lead the peace negotiations, which many saw as a symbol of his commitment to the process. But he did not mention either of them on Monday in his remarks with Mr. Netanyahu. The two men, joined by another senior official, Dina H. Powell, last traveled to the region in late August, visiting several Arab countries before arriving in Jerusalem and the West Bank. There was no tangible progress toward talks, and by all accounts, their biggest achievement was simply keeping the Palestinians from abandoning the process. If anything, the conditions for a peace agreement have deteriorated since Mr. Trump took office. Mr. Netanyahu is under investigation for corruption and, facing a possible indictment, he is highly unlikely to alienate his right-wing coalition by taking a risk on a peace agreement. Mr. Abbas, 82 and nearing the end of his career, appears more preoccupied with feuding inside his Fatah Party than with striking a deal with Mr. Netanyahu. There was a glimmer of hope in news Monday that Fatah, which administers the West Bank, and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that runs Gaza, were moving ahead with a plan for a Palestinian unity government under the leadership of Fatah. But such agreements have been proclaimed before, only to fall apart after the two sides could not agree on a transfer of power. Some administration officials said that using the United Nations calendar to try to force negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians could backfire because the talks would inevitably fail, which would feed cynicism about the broader process. Mr. Trump also faces an uphill battle reconciling Qatar and its neighbors. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is not coming to the United Nations, depriving Mr. Trump of the chance to put him and the Qatari emir in the same room. But analysts said he had more leverage over the Gulf leaders than he does over the Israelis or Palestinians. “The Saudis want us to stay in the region and counter the Iranian expansion and use of Shia militias,” said Dennis B. Ross, who has worked on Middle East issues for several presidents. “So if we can show we have moved the Qataris, they won’t say no to what we produce.”",The New York Times
2017,Trump to Hold Call With Jewish Leaders Ahead of High Holy Days,"President Trump will hold a conference call on Friday morning with Jewish leaders ahead of the High Holy Days, moving ahead with a standard White House event that several rabbinical groups have vowed to boycott. “In commemoration of the Jewish High Holy Days, President Donald J. Trump would like to invite you to a conference call where he will send well wishes for the upcoming holidays and discuss his administration’s progress on issues of interest to the Jewish community,” a brief email to invitees said. “We hope that you will accept our invitation to join this exciting call as the Jewish people welcome 5778 and reflect on the past year,” the email said. The tradition of the conference call had been nonpartisan in previous years ahead of the holidays of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur. But late in August, four coalitions of rabbis said they would boycott the call, in the wake of Mr. Trump’s equivocating response to the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va. Issues related to the Jewish community have been problematic for the president throughout his presidency. A statement from the White House on Holocaust Remembrance Day made no mention of the millions of Jews who were killed, instead focusing on “all” who suffered. And the president’s statement that there were “very fine people” among the white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville prompted an outcry. It was not immediately clear how many groups were invited to participate on the conference call. Still, some people thought the president deserved praise for going ahead with it. “It is important that President Trump is holding this outreach call with Jewish leaders and rabbis ahead of Rosh Hashana,” said Nathan Diament, the executive director for public policy at the Orthodox Union. “It is a testament to the American ideal of religious diversity and it is meaningful that the president is continuing this tradition started by President Obama,” he said. Graham Roth, a spokesman for the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said the group’s position has not changed. “Reform rabbis, along with Reconstructionist and Conservative rabbis, decided to forgo hosting the annual High Holiday call with the president this year,” he said in an email. “This was not a decision made lightly, but the president’s lack of moral leadership in the wake of Charlottesville made it necessary.”",The New York Times
2017,Trump to Propose Sweeping Tax Cut for Corporations and Individuals,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will propose a sweeping rewrite of the federal tax code on Wednesday, outlining a plan to reduce rates for corporations and individuals and eliminate some popular deductions, in a move that will set off a scramble among powerful groups eager to protect their tax breaks. The proposal will call for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, doubling the standard deduction for individual taxpayers and slightly increasing the bottom tax rate to 12 percent from 10 percent, according to two officials briefed on the details of the blueprint. The framework, which has been agreed upon by Republican leaders in the House and Senate, leaves most of the details to Congress but proposes a reduction in the individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, while leaving the door open for an unspecified, higher bracket for the wealthiest Americans. The plan would also, for the first time, create a 25 percent tax for “pass through” businesses, which account for the vast majority of business income in the United States and are currently taxed at individual rates. Pulling the tax code levers inevitably creates winners and losers, but the scant details of the plan, including how it will be paid for and which deductions are on the chopping block, make it impossible to determine the distributional effects and whether it would actually help middle-class taxpayers and not the wealthiest Americans. At a dinner with conservative and evangelical leaders on Monday evening at the White House, Mr. Trump spoke extensively about his tax plan and said that referring to “tax reform” as “tax cuts” was a much better way of communicating the effort. Over a meal that ended with apple pie, Mr. Trump also said that repatriation of taxes on corporate profits kept offshore would be part of the plan. He did not describe changes to carve-outs or deductions, according to a person in the room. At one point, Mr. Trump said that getting the corporate rate down was the key to getting the economy to grow. The president said that he had grown tired of listening to foreign leaders, like India’s Narendra Modi, describe a gross domestic product growth rate close to 10 percent, while Mr. Trump had nothing comparable to show, according to the person, who asked for anonymity because it was a private dinner. The White House is trying to navigate a narrow path on an issue that administration officials believe can reboot Mr. Trump’s presidency. It is an attempt to assuage the demand for lower taxes among wealthy party donors without being perceived by Mr. Trump’s working-class base as giving a windfall to the rich. Mr. Trump promised after meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday that “we will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class.” He will make his pivot to overhauling the tax code official on Wednesday during a speech in Indiana where he will unveil details of a plan that he has promised will be the biggest tax cut in history. After the failure of Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, passing tax legislation has become all the more crucial, and it is no accident that the Trump administration has chosen the Hoosier State, a reliably Republican part of the country. It is also the home to Vice President Mike Pence, its former governor, and it has a Democratic senator, Joe Donnelly, whose support Mr. Trump may need. For Republicans who have been scarred by the experience of seeing tax cuts lead to fiscal shortfalls in states such as Kansas, South Carolina and Tennessee, Indiana represents a case study of where tax cuts worked. “Our history of being a state that has reduced the size of government, specifically through Pence tax cuts in 2013, makes us an example of ‘here’s these tax cuts,’ and then seeing economic growth,” said Justin Stevens, the Indiana head of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity. As governor, Mr. Pence signed legislation modestly reducing personal income taxes and taxes on companies. Coinciding with that, the state’s economy grew and unemployment declined. As of last year, Indiana’s gross domestic product ranked 16th in the United States and its unemployment rate last month was 3.5 percent, below the national level of 4.4 percent. Mr. Trump on Wednesday will make the case that this is the recipe for economic success nationally, but some economists in the state are not certain that the local strategy can be replicated on a national scale. Michael J. Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University, said it was too soon to say if the Pence tax cuts actually stimulated the state economy. “On the right, you’re going to hear that by cutting taxes you’re going to have huge new tax revenues,” Mr. Hicks said. “But there’s no analysis that finds that.” Indiana has also had to find new revenue to fund infrastructure projects and rebuild crumbling roads. This year, the state approved a 10-cents-per-gallon gas tax. Finding money to pay for the Trump administration’s ambitious tax plan will be one of the bigger puzzles. Republicans say they are counting on a surge in economic growth and on the elimination of deductions to make up a fiscal shortfall that tax experts have suggested could amount to trillions of dollars. Last week, members of the Senate Budget Committee agreed on a framework that would add to the federal deficit in order to pave the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years. The budget resolution still must pass both houses of Congress before work can begin in earnest on tax legislation, and some Republicans have already expressed reluctance. Assessing the cost of the Republican tax framework will be difficult until more details are made available. Analyses of Mr. Trump’s previous plans and the House Republican blueprint from 2016 were estimated to reduce government revenues by between $3 trillion and $7 trillion over a decade. Mr. Trump is expected to intensify his pitch to get Democrats on board with his tax plan. Mr. Donnelly, who is seen as vulnerable in a state that voted heavily for Mr. Trump, is one of three senators who did not sign a letter from Democrats making demands that the tax plan not benefit the rich or add to the deficit. Mr. Trump will probably call him out directly on Wednesday. During his meeting on Tuesday with Republicans and Democrats from the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Trump also made a pitch for bipartisanship. “It is time for both parties to come together and do what is right for the American people,” he said. But garnering support from Democrats will not be easy. “Trump asked for Democrats to jump on the caboose after the tax train has already left the station,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, who complained that lowering top tax rates and repealing the estate tax would be a boon for the wealthy. “I saw no Democrat ready to jump on board.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump vs. N.F.L. Players Who Kneel,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Simmering Debate on Race Reaches Boil as More Athletes Join Chorus of Dissent” (news analysis, front page, Sept. 25): Donald Trump objects to professional athletes “disrespecting our flag” by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem at athletic events to protest inequalities experienced by Americans of color, although our Constitution expressly allows such freedom of expression. Meanwhile Mr. Trump himself shows actual disrespect for our flag, our Constitution, the rule of law, the separation of powers and even basic personal decency. Disrespect? Donald Trump is disrespect personified. CHRIS WEINMANN, NORWICH, VT. To the Editor: As if politics hasn’t intruded into our daily lives enough, President Trump has now declared war on the National Football League regarding players’ behavior during the national anthem and salute to the flag. It raises the question as to the place of these patriotic symbols at sports events. Certainly these are not political or even patriotic events. In presentations of theater, motion pictures, opera, and pop and rock music concerts, no such ceremony is required. Without loss of patriotism and love of these national symbols, isn’t it time that the national anthem and salute to the flag are dispensed with at sporting events so that we can get right to that for which everyone has gathered: the game? HOWARD SCHAIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: I’ve been a National Football League fan for 50 years and a season-ticket holder for more than five. After this weekend’s protests against the flag, I will not watch another game this year. I support every American’s right to free speech and protest. My disappointment is in these millionaire players’ choice to take the easy route by turning their backs on the flag. Why not take your money and invest in an inner-city revitalization project, community policing program or a multitude of other programs that would actually do something? Actually get involved rather than turning your back on the flag that men and women have fought and died for! MURRAY SALESGROSSE POINTE, MICH. To the Editor: My wife and I aren’t football fans, but we are immensely proud of the players, coaches and owners for taking this principled stand (or knee). It is nothing short of tragic that professional athletes need to give a civics lesson to the president of the United States. Clearly, they have a far greater grasp of our Constitution and a far deeper understanding of what this country is supposed to be than the person in the Oval Office. Hats off to all of you! MACKENZIE ALLENSANTA FE, N.M. To the Editor: Without wishing to defend our president, it must be said that the First Amendment does not protect speech in the private workplace; it only prohibits the government from regulating speech. This is settled law. Every day across America, employees less famous than star athletes are fired for saying things their bosses don’t like — even for displaying political bumper stickers on their cars. It’s perfectly legal. While I hope team owners continue to allow employees to express their opinions on the job, they have no constitutional requirement to do so. MAX ALEXANDERSOUTH THOMASTON, ME. To the Editor: Many of the arguments against football players’ expressing their political views during the national anthem hinge on the notion that “politics doesn’t belong in the workplace.” Please! Professional football stadiums on a fall Sunday afternoon are the closest we come in American society to the public square. This is a place where people all across the political spectrum come together and spend time in one another’s company for a few hours. If expressions of political belief are out of place here, why do we even play the national anthem in this setting? DAVID E. COHEN, PRINCETON, N.J. To the Editor: People go to sporting events to see teams or individuals perform, not to watch a political or religious demonstration. HERB STARK, MOORESVILLE, N.C. To the Editor: On Sunday the country saw the National Football League react to President Trump’s statement about kneeling during the national anthem. While I congratulate the players, former players and owners, I wonder where they all were last year when Colin Kaepernick took a knee. Few other players were willing to take a knee then. Mr. Kaepernick was punished by the owners and to this day still does not have a job in the N.F.L. Which N.F.L. team owners will have the guts to denounce their own hypocrisy and offer Mr. Kaepernick a job as quarterback? CATHIE PERSELAY SEIDMANMILLBURN, N.J.",The New York Times
2017,"Trump, Hurricane Maria, Mexico: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump made a bellicose debut speech at the U.N. General Assembly, threatening to “totally destroy” North Korea and referring to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man.” He called the Iran nuclear deal “an embarrassment,” promised to “crush the loser terrorists” in the Middle East and said the U.S. was prepared to confront Venezuela’s authoritarian government. Here’s the video. Not in attendance this year: Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto leader, who has been widely condemned for her failure to speak up for the Rohingya people. _____ 2. Mexico was hit with a 7.1-magnitude earthquake, just two weeks after it was struck by the most powerful one in a century. At least 100 are dead across the country, and 40 buildings in Mexico City collapsed. Millions poured into the streets and remained there, fearful of returning inside. Images show crushed cars and falling facades. Rescuers formed human chains to remove rubble by hand, and called for silence so they could hear the cries of survivors. The quake came on the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 quake that killed as many as 10,000 people. _____ 3. Hurricane Maria left “mind boggling” damage on the Caribbean island nation of Dominica. The Category 5 storm is expected to approach the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tomorrow. Here’s a map of its projected path. It’s not your imagination: The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season has been unusually active. At the U.N., leaders of island nations called for a reconceptualization of aid to help vulnerable countries recover from devastating storms linked to climate change. _____ 4. The special counsel inquiry into Russian election interference is using tough tactics. Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, above, woke up one morning in July to find federal agents with a search warrant had picked the lock of his home and raided it. More recently, one of our Washington reporters was having lunch at a steakhouse when he realized that two men sitting near him were part of the Trump legal team — and that they were discussing just how rattling the investigation is. He describes the experience in this essay, and talked about it on today’s episode of “The Daily.” Separately, the Senate Intelligence Committee abruptly postponed an interview with President Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen after he released his opening statement to the media. _____ 5. On Capitol Hill, the bond between two senators, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, is being tested. At issue is how Mr. McCain will vote on a new Republican health care bill, which would dismantle the Affordable Care Act by taking money spent under the law and sending it to states. Mr. Graham is a co-sponsor. It’s a last-ditch effort, and supporters say it’s gaining traction. But a clock is ticking: A vote must take place by the end of next week because of procedural rules. Above, Mr. McCain met with the father of a sailor who died in the U.S.S. Fitzgerald’s collision. _____ 6. Toys “R” Us, one of the world’s largest toy store chains, has filed for bankruptcy, becoming the latest casualty of the pressures facing brick-and-mortar stores. Its roughly 1,600 stores, in the U.S. and around the world, will remain open as the company figures out a new plan to “bring play to kids everywhere and be a best friend to parents.” _____ 7. Our tech columnist reviewed the new iPhone, or as he called it, “the familiar little slab of digital horror and delight.” He said the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feel like a swan song, “an ultimate refinement before eternal retirement.” They’re similar to their immediate predecessors, but a solid upgrade, with a faster processor. The iPhone X, marketed as the foundation for the device’s next iteration, is not yet available to reviewers. _____ 8. Scientists have found the genes that control pattern and color in a butterfly’s wing — meaning they may someday be able to design them. The advances are thanks to the new Crispr-Cas DNA editing technique, which allows researchers to figure out what a gene does by deleting it and seeing what happens. “These are experiments we could only have dreamed of years ago,” one scientist said. “The most challenging task in my career has become an undergraduate project overnight.” _____ 9. Is “Mother!” the most confusing movie of 2017, or the most provocative? The director Darren Aronofsky and the stars Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem spoke to us about filming what our writer calls an “ambitious parable hidden in a horror flick,” which ends in “flaming nightmare surrealism, stuffed with themes that divided, and mystified, critics.” While filming the most disturbing scene, Ms. Lawrence hyperventilated, tore her diaphragm and had to be put on oxygen. “I’ve never had to go that dark,” she said. _____ 10. Finally, the internet’s been ablaze with commentary over Sean Spicer’s appearance at the Emmys. James Corden was in one of the most incriminating photographs, caught trying to give Mr. Spicer a kiss on the cheek. On “The Late Late Show,” Mr. Corden first denied it, then tried to explain himself. “Anyone ever have that feeling when you get a little drunk and then wake up the next morning and think, ‘Oh, God, who did I kiss last night?’ It’s a bit like that,” he said.

2017,"Trump, Though Not on Stage, Looms Large in Alabama G.O.P. Senate Debate","MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Senator Luther Strange used every opportunity he had at a Republican candidate forum here on Thursday to invoke his support from President Trump as he defended his seat against former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, who unfurled a litany of accusations against Mr. Strange and ridiculed his reliance on the president’s endorsement just days before they face off in Alabama’s special Senate election. Mr. Strange, who was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is wagering that his only path to victory next Tuesday is through embracing the president and attempting to make the race a Trump referendum. Trailing in the polls against Mr. Moore, who enjoys a devoted following among fellow evangelicals, Mr. Strange argued on Thursday that Mr. Trump’s surprise decision to intervene in the campaign and join him at a rally amounted to a seal of approval in a state where the president is deeply popular among Republicans. He was unabashed about referring to his telephone conversations with the president, explaining how the two newly sworn-in Republicans had bonded this year as he dismissed the increasingly audible snickering from the audience at every mention of Mr. Trump. “You may resent that the president is my friend, and is supporting me in this race, but I think it’s a good thing the president of the United States has a personal relationship with the junior senator from Alabama,” said Mr. Strange, before once again plugging his joint appearance with Mr. Trump, which is scheduled for Friday evening in the northern city of Huntsville. Mr. Moore mocked Mr. Strange’s grasping of the president’s coattails, accusing him of offering a one-note message and even being a tad obsessive. “I can’t tell you what the president thinks, I can’t tell you every move he makes, when he goes to the bathroom and when he doesn’t,” Mr. Moore shot back after Mr. Strange claimed that Mr. Trump had noticed the former judge’s apparent unfamiliarity with the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA, which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Mr. Moore won laughs for that riposte, but he was put in a more difficult position after claiming that Mr. Trump “is being cut off in his office.” He also said the president is “being redirected by people like McConnell, who does not support his agenda,” referring to Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the Senate majority leader. Mr. Strange quickly fired back that it was “insulting to the president” to suggest he was “being manipulated.” The two Republicans appeared side by side for just over an hour in the Alabama capital city with only a timekeeper between them. They delivered opening and closing statements, and for the bulk of the debate took turns speaking five minutes apiece. That each campaign would agree to such a risky, moderator-free format so close to a high-stakes election was remarkable, and many believed one or the other would eventually find a reason to back out of the forum. The game of political chicken began when Mr. Moore challenged Mr. Strange to what Mr. Moore called a “mano a mano” showdown, perhaps thinking that the incumbent would not take him up on his dare. But Mr. Strange, needing to make up ground, saw an opportunity to trumpet his ties to Mr. Trump. And for the underfunded Mr. Moore, who won fame after he was removed from the judicial bench for refusing to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from the lobby of the state Supreme Court, the forum provided a chance to assail Mr. Strange on a range of issues before a dozen television cameras and even more reporters. Complaining about the multimillion-dollar advertising assault against him from Mr. McConnell’s allies, Mr. Moore, acting as if he were the one trailing in the polls, uncorked a series of attacks against Mr. Strange. Reading from opposition research on his lectern, Mr. Moore targeted Mr. Strange for his career as a Washington lobbyist, noting that he once owned a pricey condominium on Pennsylvania Avenue. He noted that Mr. Strange had only recently criticized the Senate filibuster rule. And he sounded a populist note by contrasting his youth without a bathroom to the senator’s roots in Mountain Brook, a wealthy Birmingham suburb that for decades has been used in Alabama campaigns as a symbol for elitists who are out of touch with the rest of the state. Mr. Moore’s harshest attack may have been over how Mr. Strange found his way to the Senate. He suggested that Mr. Strange, who was state attorney general when he was appointed to the Senate, was part of a corrupt bargain with former Gov. Robert Bentley, who was driven from office over an apparent extramarital affair. Mr. Moore said Mr. Strange would “do anything to get his job.” “That’s called a lack of character,” Mr. Moore added. Mr. Strange did not reply directly to the broadsides during the debate. Addressing reporters afterward, he also dodged a question about whether he had been investigating Mr. Bentley’s conduct when he was appointed. Standing just down the hill from the State Capitol, Mr. Strange could not fully escape Mr. Bentley’s shadow. “Answer it, Luther!” demanded Jim Zeigler, Alabama’s state auditor, who crashed the news conference in a fitting conclusion to the feisty evening.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trumpcare Is Dead. Long Live the Trumpcare Opposition.,"David Leonhardt It’s over. And it’s not over. The effort to take away health insurance from millions of people — known by the name it deserves, Trumpcare — seems to have failed again. The latest version, the Graham-Cassidy bill, looks doomed, with three Republican senators joining all 48 Democrats and independents in opposition. Three plus 48 equals 51, and 51 no votes equal defeat. Thank goodness. More specifically, thank goodness for the citizens who have rallied against the bill — the disabled activists who protested on Capitol Hill yet again on Monday, the callers who flooded the Senate switchboard, the experts who dispassionately explained the bill’s brutal effects, and many others. This outpouring has left Republican leaders without the votes to pass a bill by Saturday, the end of the federal fiscal year. If they don’t meet that Sept. 30 deadline, Senate rules force them to start the process all over again. Which is why many observers are declaring Obamacare repeal to be dead. But it is not dead. By now, everyone should have learned that President Trump and Mitch McConnell are not going to give up until absolutely forced to. They didn’t give up when bills failed this summer, and they won’t give up if they miss the Sept. 30 deadline. They have promised their base and their donors that they will repeal Barack Obama’s signature achievement — extending decent medical care to the sick, the poor and the middle class. As long as Trump and McConnell believe that they are close to finding 51 votes, they will be tempted to try again. They can restart the process in October or beyond. That’s why the next few days are important. Of particular importance are the positions that the remaining undecided senators take, starting with Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski. For one thing, it’s not Sept. 30 yet. McConnell can still try to flip the bill’s opponents. Susan Collins, John McCain and Rand Paul all look like solid no votes, but nothing is guaranteed. Trumpcare has tended to fare best when people assumed it was kaput and stopped paying attention. And the margin of defeat matters, too. The more senators who oppose Graham-Cassidy, the less likely that yet another version of Trumpcare will emerge. For Murkowski, the decision is a character test, as it was for McCain. He passed his test, keeping a promise to oppose any rushed, secretive bill that made a mockery of the Senate, as Graham-Cassidy has. Murkowski’s promises are different, but no less stark, as The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent has noted. She has said, “We must continue to prohibit insurers from discriminating against pre-existing conditions.” Graham-Cassidy would instead allow insurers to price sick people out of the market. Murkowski has also insisted that Alaska not lose federal health care money, and the bill’s authors have tried to buy her vote with late changes. But the bill still reduces Alaska’s funding — and claims otherwise with a blatantly misleading data table. It was quickly debunked by health care experts. The question for Murkowski is whether she is willing to let her vote be bought — for a cut-rate price, no less. My hope and guess is no. She stood firm against earlier versions of Trumpcare. But her lack of an answer so far is worrisome. There are several other uncommitted Republicans, as well. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Rob Portman of Ohio are on the list, and both of their states would suffer badly under Graham-Cassidy. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah also have not announced their stances. All are now freed from the pressure of being the decisive vote. The margin of Graham-Cassidy’s defeat (regardless of whether the Senate actually votes) will shape the next steps on health care. If Republicans come to terms with their total lack of a reasonable repeal plan, more of them will be open to a bipartisan compromise to fix Obamacare’s flaws. Such a compromise would encourage red states to sign up fully for Obamacare and, in turn, make future repeal efforts less likely. To his credit, Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican, started work on a bipartisan deal, before abandoning it last week, out of partisan loyalty to Republicans pushing Graham-Cassidy. But if the bill seems permanently defeated, Alexander will be able to resume the role of Senate statesman. He is well suited for it — in his third term, having previously been a governor and a cabinet member — and he doesn’t need to let himself get pushed around again. The off-again-on-again fight over Trumpcare has been grueling. The activists, congressional staff members and others who have done heroic work in defense of their fellow citizens have good reason to feel exhausted. Unfortunately, it’s still not time to rest or celebrate. But victory is getting closer.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Bellicose Speech at the U.N.,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Heralding ‘America First’ in Combative U.N. Speech, Trump Airs List of Threats” (front page, Sept. 20): President Trump’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday was self-centered and dangerous for world peace. Under the cover of some beautiful oratory, it was an open attempt to drift the United Nations from the broader avenues of global values to the dark alleys of nationalism. It was heartbreaking to see that our president not only expressed his narrow views but also encouraged others to follow his path. He mentioned the sufferings of Americans caused by the recent hurricanes but did not bother to express any sympathy to the people of Mexico, India, Nepal and Bangladesh who have been facing death and destruction by nature on a much larger scale. There is a lesson for the proponents of “All Lives Matter” in this. He damaged the credibility of the United States government by threatening to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal. How will leaders of the world trust us if they think that every new president will break international agreements? President Trump failed to realize that he was on the global stage addressing the whole world and not appeasing his base in Arizona or Ohio. NASEEM KHAN, LELAND, N.C. To the Editor: Are we Americans suffering from battered nation or Stockholm syndrome? Have we become so inured to the boorish, bombastic blather (with apologies to William Safire), the outright lies and the utter foolishness emanating from President Trump that we shrug off his “crush the loser terrorists” and “Rocket Man” (North Korea’s leader) speech before the United Nations? Oh, that wasn’t too bad, we say, almost relieved; he’s been much worse. We’re like hostages looking for a glimmer of hope.

Now, in response to aggression by Kim Jong-un, President Trump is threatening to “totally destroy” that country, with the enormous loss of life such an action would entail.

2017,Trump’s Bid to End Saudi-Qatar Stalemate Ends in Recriminations,"CAIRO — An attempt by President Trump to break the stalemate that has divided the wealthiest countries in the Middle East ended in failure on Saturday, when leaders from Qatar and Saudi Arabia, after speaking by phone for the first time in months, exchanged dueling, contradictory statements. Mr. Trump arranged the call, which took place late on Friday, and promised a breakthrough in the bitter dispute that has plunged the Persian Gulf into turmoil and has threatened American security interests. Since June, Saudi Arabia has led the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain in imposing a punishing trade and transport boycott against tiny, gas-rich Qatar, accusing it of financing terrorism and having overly cozy relations with Iran. Qatar has rejected the charges, countering that its rivals are seeking to curb its sovereignty and tame its influential television channel Al Jazeera. Mr. Trump stepped into the frame this past week, offering his services as a mediator and predicting a quick victory. “I think you’d have a deal worked out very quickly,” he said at the White House on Thursday, standing alongside the emir of Kuwait, who has led Arab efforts to end the standoff. But Friday’s phone call between the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, seemed to underscore only how hard it might be to settle the angry, often petty, dispute. Within hours of the call, Qatar’s state news agency issued a statement that said the emir “welcomed a proposal” by the young Saudi prince to appoint two peace envoys to help bridge their differences. That language infuriated the Saudis, who appeared insulted by the suggestion that they had bowed first in the dispute. The Saudi state news service retorted with its own report, citing unnamed officials, that accused Qatar of distorting the facts and declared that dialogue between the two countries had been suspended. In the Saudi telling, it was the Qataris who first broached the idea of peace mediators. The exchange encapsulated the vehemence of a dispute that has worried Western countries allied with both sides. Through the summer, a series of envoys, including the United States secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, have traveled to the Persian Gulf for talks. Qatar and its foes have exchanged jabs through news and social media, in fake news stories and leaked emails, and on the streets of Western capitals. An influence race has erupted in Washington, where both sides have spent huge sums on lobbyists and advertising in a bid to influence political and public opinion. On Saturday, official Saudi outlets tweeted an apparently fake Islamic State statement expressing support for Qatar. While some analysts said that Friday’s call, even if unsuccessful, held out hope that the two sides were finally ready to talk, others viewed it as a sign of how entrenched they have become. “The problem is as much about appearing to not capitulate to the other side as it is trying to solve any problems,” said Michael Stephens of the Royal United Services Institute in London. “Given the hypersensitivity of both sides to appearing weak,” he said, “it makes the problem considerably harder to solve.” Mr. Trump’s hand may be weakened by his own insistence on taking sides. After initially supporting the Saudis, he appeared to take a more balanced approach at the urging of Mr. Tillerson, who knows leaders on both sides from his previous career as an oil executive. Qatar is home to the largest American air base in the Middle East and is the center of military operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. But at the White House on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to take a new jab at Qatar when he complained of the “massive funding of terrorism by certain countries.” He added, “If they don’t stop the funding of terrorism, I don’t want them to come together.” Mr. Trump was standing alongside the emir of Kuwait, Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, who has led Arab efforts to solve the crisis and quickly reached for a more conciliatory note. “Now is the time that we have to forget all these differences,” the emir said.",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Big Gamble: Can He Pull Alabama Senator to Victory?,"HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — When President Trump took the stage here just days before Alabama’s pivotal Republican Senate runoff, he all but revealed his Oval Office deliberations about whether to stand with Senator Luther Strange and risk attaching himself to a potential loser. “If Luther doesn’t win, they’re not going to say we picked up 25 points in a very short period of time, they’re going say, ‘Donald Trump, the president of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line,’” he predicted to 7,500 Alabamians at a rally on Friday night as Mr. Strange looked on. His blurting out of his political stage directions was a vintage moment of Trumpian indiscretion. But it also had the benefit of being accurate. The contest between Mr. Strange and Roy Moore, a former State Supreme Court justice and evangelical firebrand, is the most significant test yet of the president’s power to sway the party’s conservative base. If Mr. Moore wins the runoff on Tuesday, Republican leaders fear he will further widen the split in the party between populists and the establishment. That could embolden more lawmakers to defy the party leadership and encourage other insurgents to challenge Republican incumbents, no matter Mr. Trump’s preference. Dismissing the advice of his aides and flying here to campaign for Mr. Strange, Mr. Trump gambled that he alone could reverse Mr. Strange’s deficit in the polls. The president made the trip after being implored by Mr. Strange’s Senate colleagues to try to rescue his candidacy. There is, of course, no small measure of irony in Mr. Trump’s decision to side with the establishment forces that lined up against his campaign for president. If Mr. Strange, who was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, wins, Mr. Trump will deal a blow to some of the same anti-Washington forces that propelled his own rise. But Mr. Trump has taken a liking to Mr. Strange, who, he noted at the rally, has not asked for any presidential favors, and several Senate Republicans have told him that Mr. Moore would be an unreliable ally. And should Mr. Strange prevail, the president will have established himself as the dominant force on the right, someone able to transcend the establishment-versus-Tea Party divide that has shaped Republican politics for the last eight years. “Trump becomes the validator of what the outsider, conservative perspective is,” said Steven Law, who runs the Senate Leadership Fund, a group inspired by Senator Mitch McConnell that is pouring over $10 million into the race on behalf of Mr. Strange. “You had groups on the far right that thought they had the monopoly on that, but they’ve been supplanted by Trump.” But should Mr. Strange lose, it would sow fresh doubts about Mr. Trump’s influence and create new headaches for party leaders. Other establishment-aligned candidates may find that the president is unable to inoculate them from populist challengers. “If Roy Moore wins, Bannon and all the other of those people will pop out of the woodwork everywhere,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, the veteran Alabama Republican, referring to the former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, who has taken a leading role against the preferred candidate of his former boss. Mr. Bannon aims to do just that. He argues that should Mr. Moore win, Senate Republicans from Arizona and Nevada to Tennessee and Mississippi could find themselves in great peril. What’s more, House Republicans, who are already facing a growing number of populist challengers, could face an even bigger wave of them. And Mr. Moore’s success could prompt wealthy conservative donor families like the Mercers “to invest more” in the insurgency, said Scott Reed, the top political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. More immediately, the congressional wing of the party would be saddled with an often inflammatory Senate candidate who could invite a surge of Democratic money into Alabama and set off a host of questions about his provocative views on social issues that few Republican officials want to litigate. Mr. Moore, 70, who rose to fame after he was removed from the bench for refusing to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from the lobby of the State Supreme Court, is a pre-Trump-era Christian conservative, far more focused on issues of sex and morality than race and identity. Reading from prepared remarks at a debate on Thursday in Montgomery, Mr. Moore declared that “crime, corruption, immorality, abortion, sodomy, sexual perversions sweep our land.” And appearing at a Baptist church last month in Jasper, Mr. Moore mused about what same-sex marriage could lead to. “Maybe you can marry a horse or a cow, or five men or five women,” he said. It is the sort of message that terrifies Republican elites, who fear he could be a more weaponized version of Todd Akin, the 2012 Missouri Senate candidate who lost after saying women’s bodies could block a pregnancy in cases of “legitimate rape.” “Roy Moore would be the Todd Akin of 2017 and 2018 for every Republican on the ballot,” said Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, who is aligned with the Senate Leadership Fund. “Republicans will be asked, ‘Do you agree homosexuality should be punished by death, do you believe 9/11 was a result of God’s anger?’ He’ll say outrageous things, the media will play it up, and every Republican will be asked, ‘Do you agree with that?’” Locally, some Republicans are also uneasy about the prospect of Mr. Moore — whose lead in the polls over Mr. Strange, 64, is in the single digits — being their nominee. They worry that the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor, could run well among moderate voters and create a competitive race. Mr. Moore won his last re-election to the state court by just a four-point margin in 2012, a year in which Mitt Romney carried the state by 23 points. “I think they’ll go after that seat,” Mr. Shelby said of the Democrats’ approach should Mr. Moore win on Tuesday. That is less likely if Mr. Strange captures the nomination, he said. “If Luther wins, he’s in.” The Senate Democratic campaign arm has lined up a pollster to test Mr. Jones’s strengths and Mr. Moore’s vulnerabilities. And Alabama Democrats are openly rooting for the former judge. “We want Roy Moore to win that primary,” said Patricia Todd, a Democratic state representative from Birmingham. “He gives us a better shot in the general election.” Ms. Todd, who is also the state director for the Human Rights Campaign, said national gay donors should pay attention to the implications of Mr. Moore’s potential nomination. “It could really send a message across the country,” she said. Many Republicans here believe that they will retain the seat, even if Mr. Moore is the nominee and it requires more money and attention than the national party would typically bestow on a deep-red state. At his rally on Friday, Mr. Trump said that both Mr. Strange and Mr. Moore were “good men,” and the president, seeming to hedge his bets, has said he will campaign for Mr. Moore in the general election if he wins the primary. And to the anti-establishment wing of the party, Mr. Moore’s success would be a further vindication of Mr. Trump, no matter his allegiance of the moment to Mr. Strange. “This will be very similar to what happened last November: The people spoke,” said Mack Butler, a state representative from Mr. Moore’s home county. Mr. Butler added, “We expect Tuesday to have a victory, and the president of the United States will call Judge Moore and congratulate him, and then he’ll be on the Moore train.” But for Republican elites, this contest has grown into something far larger than just a battle for a single Senate seat. To groups like the McConnell-backed Senate Leadership Fund, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association, which are sending mailers and airing television ads in the closing days of the race, Alabama is their chance to halt a rebellion. It is, after all, not just the president who is putting his prestige on the line: Mr. Bannon is making an aggressive push for Mr. Moore, turning Breitbart News into a virtual arm of the former judge’s campaign and planning to appear with the former judge on the election’s eve. If Mr. Moore falls short, it will raise questions about the potency of Mr. Bannon’s populist army — and reveal the limitations of running against the establishment and Mr. McConnell when Mr. Trump is siding with party leaders. “It would remind Bannon who’s in charge, and I think give the president and the governing wing of the party momentum,” said Mr. Reed of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who is working with business leaders here to turn out votes for Mr. Strange. “That’s why we’re going all in to shut it down now.”",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Choice for Top Civil Rights Job Defends Private-Sector Work,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s nominee to lead the Justice Department’s civil rights division defended his work on both sides of discrimination cases on Wednesday during his confirmation hearing, seeking to ease the concerns of civil rights advocates who have denounced his nomination. Mr. Trump’s choice, Eric S. Dreiband, a partner at the Jones Day law firm and a former George W. Bush administration official, vowed to enforce the law as vigorously as he defended major corporations. “In private practice, lawyers are ethically bound to zealously advocate for their clients,” said Mr. Dreiband. “I think it prepares you well to serve in public service.” Mr. Dreiband has defended major corporations in discrimination cases related to age, pregnancy and religion. He also represented the University of North Carolina last year in litigation against the Justice Department over transgender bathroom access, and in one of the most high-profile instances, he argued before the Supreme Court in 2015 that Abercrombie & Fitch had been justified in refusing to hire a Muslim woman because she wore a head scarf that clashed with its dress code. Civil rights activists have condemned Mr. Dreiband’s nomination to lead the division, which handles voting rights, policing and discrimination cases. As America’s top civil rights lawyer, he would inherit a number of politically charged investigations, including the Justice Department’s joint inquiry into last month’s deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., at a counterprotest of white nationalists. Mr. Dreiband pledged to uphold the division’s mission. “Anyone who perpetrates crimes or any other civil rights violations that come within the jurisdiction of the civil rights division should know — they should be on notice, if I’m confirmed — that the civil rights division is coming for them,” Mr. Dreiband told the Senate Judiciary Committee, deploring “the bigotry and ideology” of white supremacy. Just how broadly Mr. Dreiband will interpret the law remains a question. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department pushed the frontiers of civil rights law, inserting itself into private lawsuits on behalf of transgender students, juvenile prisoners and people who videotaped police officers. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been quick to unwind much of that legacy. In the first six months of the Trump administration, Mr. Sessions withdrew protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity; reversed an objection to Texas’ strict voter-identification law; and initiated a sweeping review of legally enforceable consent decrees with troubled police departments pursuing reform. On Wednesday, Mr. Dreiband pointed to his work at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Department of Labor as evidence he had protected and would continue to protect Americans’ civil rights. He invoked a case he had overseen at the E.E.O.C. in which a deaf man had received a settlement for having been refused a job as a dishwasher. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, asked whether Mr. Dreiband would have pursued such a case had the dishwasher been not deaf but gay. Mr. Dreiband avoided directly answering the question, prompting concern from gay rights advocates. “There’s such symbolism in terms of who’s at the helm of civil rights,” said Sharon M. McGowan, the director of strategy at Lambda Legal, a gay-rights advocacy organization that sent a letter to senators opposing Mr. Dreiband’s nomination and recruited about four dozen other activist groups to sign on to the effort. “I don’t know where he may fall when the history is written, but that position is so important even beyond the work.” Ms. McGowan was a career prosecutor in the Justice Department’s civil rights division until February. She departed because she disagreed with the administration’s agenda, she said. Allies of Mr. Dreiband’s said on Wednesday that he was focused on facts and forcefully argued for whomever he represented. “He puts the rule of law above partisan political bickering,” said David B. Grinberg, a former spokesman for the E.E.O.C., where Mr. Dreiband worked as general counsel. “Eric believes in equal justice under law for all Americans.” Just three Trump administration Justice Department officials, including Mr. Sessions, have been confirmed by the Senate so far.",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Comments on N.F.L. and Stephen Curry Draw Intense Reaction,"The days of superstar athletes being unwilling to speak their minds for fear of damaging their earnings or reputation appear to be at an end. President Trump decided to take on some of the biggest names in pro sports on Friday and Saturday, including Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. Unlike Michael Jordan, who famously did not want to offend anyone who might buy his signature sneakers, players around the country’s leagues have begun firing back. Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. protests and reactions here. Mr. Trump has found himself criticized by players in both the N.F.L. and N.B.A., with the focus on two specific areas: The protests of the national anthem at N.F.L. games, and the open question of whether or not the Warriors would visit the White House after their recent N.B.A. championship. Neither topic is particularly fresh, but with Mr. Trump urging N.F.L. owners to “fire” the protesting players, and tweeting that the Warriors were no longer invited for a visit, the embers on both issues have been thoroughly stoked. Mr. Curry made some waves at the Warriors’ media day on Friday when he said of a potential White House visit: “I don’t want to go. That’s really it. That’s the nucleus of my belief.” The debate over any visit proved irrelevant, however, when Mr. Trump weighed in on the subject with a tweet on Saturday. The response from players was swift. Several players in both leagues condemned the announcement, in a throwback of sorts to the days when political statements by star athletes like Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, Tommie Smith and John Carlos were more common. Potentially the boldest response to Mr. Trump came from the Warriors’ chief rival, LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers: Mr. Curry was also supported by Chris Paul, the Houston Rockets point guard, who also happens to be the president of the N.B.A.’s players association. While Mr. Curry has yet to respond, his teammate, the outspoken Draymond Green, unsurprisingly weighed in. As an organization, the Warriors were far more politically reserved than Mr. Green, saying in a statement, “In lieu of a visit to the White House, we have decided that we’ll constructively use our trip to the nation’s capital in February to celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion — the values that we embrace as an organization.” No stranger to controversy involving Mr. Trump, Jemele Hill, the ESPN host, also supported Mr. Curry. Ms. Hill was recently embroiled in a debate centered on her reference to the president as a white supremacist, and his office’s call for her firing. Mr. Trump has found just as swift a response from players and personalities connected to the N.F.L. over his comments about players like Colin Kaepernick who have sat or knelt during the national anthem to protest the treatment of black people by the police. At a rally in Alabama, Trump said: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these N.F.L. owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out. He’s fired! He’s fired!’” Among the players to respond to Trump’s statements was Chris Conley, a wide receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs. In a series of strongly-worded tweets, Martellus Bennett, a tight end for the Green Bay Packers, said he was fine with being fired for what he believes in and rejected the labels put on players by the president. Richard Sherman, the outspoken Seattle Seahawks cornerback, said: The topic seemed to elicit opinions from all over, with Sean Combs, the businessman and music mogul, asking N.F.L. players to make a statement before tomorrow’s games. And none other than Ed Asner, the 87-year-old actor, tackled the subject. Amid all the chaos online, Ayesha Curry, the wife of Stephen, took the high road in the matter, refocusing the discussion on bigger events going on around the world.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Deadly Narcissism,"Paul Krugman According to a new Quinnipiac poll, a majority of Americans believe that Donald Trump is unfit to be president. That’s pretty remarkable. But you have to wonder how much higher the number would be if people really knew what’s going on. For the trouble with Trump isn’t just what he’s doing, but what he isn’t. In his mind, it’s all about him — and while he’s stroking his fragile ego, basic functions of government are being neglected or worse. Let’s talk about two stories that might seem separate: the deadly neglect of Puerto Rico, and the ongoing sabotage of American health care. What these stories have in common is that millions of Americans are going to suffer, and hundreds if not thousands die, because Trump and his officials are too self-centered to do their jobs. Start with the disaster in Puerto Rico and the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Maria struck, more than a week ago, it knocked out power to the whole of Puerto Rico, and it will be months before the electricity comes back. Lack of power can be deadly in itself, but what’s even worse is that, thanks largely to the blackout, much of the population still lacks access to drinkable water. How many will die because hospitals can’t function, or because of diseases spread by unsafe water? Nobody knows. But the situation is terrible, and time is not on Puerto Rico’s side: The longer this goes on, the worse the humanitarian crisis will get. Surely, then, you’d expect bringing in and distributing aid to be the U.S. government’s top priority. After all, we’re talking about the lives of three and a half million of our fellow citizens — more than the population of Iowa or metro San Diego. So have we seen the kind of full-court, all-out relief effort such a catastrophe demands? No. Admittedly, it’s hard to quantify the federal response. But none of the extraordinary measures you’d expect to see have materialized. The deployment of military resources seems to have been smaller and slower than it was in Texas after Harvey or Florida after Irma, even though Puerto Rico’s condition is far more dire. Until Thursday the Trump administration had refused to lift restrictions on foreign shipping to Puerto Rico, even though it had waived those rules for Texas and Florida. Why? According to the president, “people who work in the shipping industry” don’t like the idea. Furthermore, although it’s more than a week since Maria made landfall, the Trump administration has yet to submit a request for aid to Congress. And where’s the leadership? There’s a reason we expect visible focus by the president on major national disasters, including a visit to the affected area as soon as possible (Trump doesn’t plan to visit Puerto Rico until next week). It’s not just theater; it’s a signal about urgent priorities to the rest of the government, and to some extent to the nation at large. But Trump spent days after Maria’s strike tweeting about football players. When he finally got around to saying something about Puerto Rico, it was to blame the territory for its own problems. The impression one gets is of a massively self-centered individual who can’t bring himself to focus on other people’s needs, even when that’s the core of his job. And then there’s health care. Obamacare repeal has failed again, for the simple reason that Graham-Cassidy, like all the other G.O.P. proposals, was a piece of meanspirited junk. But while the Affordable Care Act survives, the Trump administration is openly trying to sabotage the law’s functioning. This sabotage is taking place on multiple levels. The administration has refused to confirm whether it will pay crucial subsidies to insurers that cover low-income customers. It has refused to clarify whether the requirement that healthy people buy insurance will be enforced. It has canceled or suspended outreach designed to get more people to sign up. These actions translate directly into much higher premiums: Insurers don’t know if they’ll be compensated for major costs, and they have every reason to expect a smaller, sicker risk pool than before. And it’s too late to reverse the damage: Insurers are finalizing their 2018 rates as you read this. Why are the Trumpists doing this? Is it a cynical calculation — make the A.C.A. fail, then claim that it was already doomed? I doubt it. For one thing, we’re not talking about people known for deep strategic calculations. For another, the A.C.A. won’t actually collapse; it will just become a program more focused on sicker, poorer Americans — and the political opposition to repeal won’t go away. Finally, when the bad news comes in, everyone will know whom to blame. No, A.C.A. sabotage is best seen not as a strategy, but as a tantrum. We can’t repeal Obamacare? Well, then, we’ll screw it up. It’s not about achieving any clear goal, but about salving the president’s damaged self-esteem. In short, Trump truly is unfit for this or any high office. And the damage caused by his unfitness will just keep growing.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Debt Deal With the Democrats,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Trump Bypasses G.O.P. to Strike a Deal on Debt” (front page, Sept. 7): While I am generally loath to say nice things about this president because his words and actions are usually beneath the dignity of the office, I have to give him credit for understanding one thing about Washington: If you want to get anything done, you have to deal with the Democrats. While the Freedom Caucus and other archconservatives may fume over the debt deal, the real takeaway lesson for them should be that if you want to be part of the solution, you have to stop being part of the problem. This deal may not usher in a new era of bipartisanship, but it does signal to these recalcitrant Republicans that there are other options and that this president is not afraid to take them. MICHAEL SCOTT, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: While it’s generally good news that President Trump struck a deal on the debt ceiling, let’s understand that it probably had less to do with Hurricane Harvey aid and bipartisanship than Mr. Trump’s own self-interest and inherent conflicts. A debt ceiling crisis, even not a full-blown default, would roil markets and increase the borrowing costs of businesses, certainly including Trump Organization businesses. So it is not without a smile that I can write that the G.O.P. has been hoist by its own petard. JONATHAN D. KARMEL, CHICAGO To the Editor: I have mixed emotions about the Democrats’ wanting to tie the debt ceiling to Hurricane Harvey funding. Although I overwhelmingly approve both funding for Harvey relief and raising the debt ceiling, which is the only responsible option, I think it should be a hard-and-fast rule that you do not politicize the debt ceiling. Ever. Defaulting on our debt is the fiscal equivalent of a unilateral nuclear strike. It is unthinkable. There should never be conditions set. There are reasons for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, to be concerned about our debt. Those concerns should be addressed in the budgeting process, not in keeping the promises to pay debt that Congress has already approved. Tying together Harvey relief funding and paying our bills on time puts both at risk, as it asks for political courage from G.O.P. legislators. Not a good bet. JEFFREY L.

2017,Opinion | Trump’s Empty Culture Wars,"Ross Douthat The secret of culture war is that it is often a good and necessary thing. People don’t like culture wars when they’re on the losing side, and while they’re losing they often complain about how cultural concerns are distractions from the “real” issues, usually meaning something to do with the deficit or education or where to peg the Medicare growth rate or which terrorist haven the United States should be bombing next. But in the sweep of American history, it’s the battles over cultural norms and so-called social issues — over race and religion, intoxicants and sex, speech and censorship, immigration and assimilation — that for better or worse have often made us who we are. Still, even a proud culture warrior should be able to concede that not all culture wars are created equal. A good culture war is one that, beneath all the posturing and demagogy and noise, has clear policy implications, a core legal or moral question, a place where one side can win a necessary victory or where a new consensus can be hashed out. A bad culture war is one in which attitudinizing, tribalism and worst-case fearmongering float around unmoored from any specific legal question, in which mutual misunderstanding reigns and a thousand grievances are stirred up without a single issue being clarified or potentially resolved. Unfortunately for us all Donald Trump is a master, a virtuoso, of the second kind of culture war — and a master, too, of taking social and cultural debates that could be important and necessary and making them stupider and emptier and all about himself. He is not the only figure pushing American arguments in that direction — cable news, reality TV, campus protesters and late-night political “comedy” all have a similar effect these days. But he is the president, which lends him a unique deranging influence, and he is unique as well in that unlike most culture warriors — who are usually initially idealists, however corrupted they may ultimately become — he has never cared about anything higher or nobler than himself, and so he’s never happier than when the entire country seems to be having a culture war about, well, Donald Trump. The N.F.L.-national anthem controversy, the latest Trump-stoked social conflagration, is a quintessential bad culture war. It was trending that way already before Trump, because the act of protest Colin Kaepernick chose to call attention to police shootings of unarmed black men — sitting and then kneeling for “The Star-Spangled Banner” — was clearer in the calculated offense it gave than in the specific cause it sought to further, clearer in its swipe at a Racist America than its prescription for redress. (That Kaepernick sported Fidel Castro T-shirts and socks depicting cops as pigs did not exactly help.) But in his usual bullying and race-baiting way, Trump has made it much, much worse, by multiplying the reasons one might reasonably kneel — for solidarity with teammates, as a protest against the president’s behavior, as a gesture in favor of free speech, as an act of racial pride — and then encouraging his own partisans to interpret the kneeling as a broad affront to their own patriotism and politics. So now we’re “arguing” (I use the term loosely) about everything from the free-speech rights of pro athletes to whether the national anthem is right-wing political correctness to LeBron James’s punditry on the miseducation of Trump voters … and the specific issue that Kaepernick intended to raise, police misconduct, is buried seven layers of controversy deep. You could say, it’s always thus with culture wars and racial battles, but in fact it isn’t and doesn’t need to be. Arguments about race were often toxic in the 1970s and 1980s, but there were core policy issues that could be argued and ultimately compromised over — crime and welfare and affirmative action — and across the 1990s they were, to some extent, and as they were overt racial tensions eased considerably. In 2001, two-thirds of Americans (and more blacks than whites) described race relations as somewhat good or very good, and while the white view was usually slightly rosier thereafter, the two-thirds pattern held for more than a decade — until Ferguson, Mo., and Black Lives Matter and the other controversies of the late Obama years, followed by the rise of Trump, sent racial optimism into a tailspin. For hope to resurface, we need specific issues and potential compromises to re-emerge. In particular, we need a public argument clearly tethered to the two big policy questions raised by police misconduct and the broader crime and incarceration debate. First, can we have the greater accountability for cops that activists reasonably demand, in which juries convict more trigger-happy officers and police departments establish a less adversarial relationship to the communities they police, without the surge of violence that’s accompanied the apparent retreat of the police in cities like Baltimore and Chicago? Second, can we continue the move toward de-incarceration — supported, not that long ago, by Republicans as well as Democrats — without reversing the gains that have made many of our cities safe? These are hard questions that can be answered only gradually, through trial-and-error and with various false starts. But they are questions that could have answers, that could point to a stable policy consensus around race and criminal justice, in a way that our present “Make America Great Again” versus “You’re All White Supremacists” culture war does not. For those answers to matter, for them to depolarize our country, we need a social and cultural debate focused on the substance that Colin Kaepernick’s choice of protest unfortunately obscured, and Donald Trump’s flagsploitation has deliberately buried. Not an end to culture war, but a better culture war — in which victory and defeat can be defined, and peace becomes a possibility.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Folly,"Thomas L. Friedman America faces two serious national security threats today that look wildly different but have one core feature in common — they both have a low probability of happening, but, if they did happen, they could have devastating consequences for our whole country and the world. One of these threats is called North Korea. If the reckless leader of North Korea is able to launch an arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles that strike the U.S. mainland, the impact on America will be incalculable. And even though the odds of that happening are low — it would be an act of suicide by the North Korean dynasty — President Trump is ready to spend billions on antimissile systems, warships, cyberdefenses, air power and war games to defuse and deter this North Korean threat. And if we prepare for a North Korean nuclear attack and it never happens, we will be left with some improved weaponry that we might be able to use in other theaters, like fighter jets, ships and missiles — but nothing particularly productive for our economy or job creation. The other low-probability, high-impact threat is climate change fueled by increased human-caused carbon emissions. The truth is, if you simply trace the steady increase in costly extreme weather events — wildfires, floods, droughts and climate-related human migrations — the odds of human-driven global warming having a devastating impact on our planet are not low probability but high probability. But let’s assume for a minute that because climate change is a complex process — which we do not fully understand — climate change is a low-probability, high-impact event just like a North Korean nuclear strike. What is the Trump team doing when confronted with this similar threat? It’s taking a spike and poking out its own eyes. In possibly the most intellectually corrupt declaration of the Trump era — a high bar — Scott Pruitt, a longtime shill for oil and gas companies now masquerading as the head of the E.P.A., actually declared that even discussing possible links between human-driven climate disruptions and the recent monster storms was “insensitive.” He said that after our country got hit by two Atlantic Category 4 hurricanes in the same year for the first time since records have been kept — storms made more destructive by rising ocean levels and warmer ocean waters. Makes me wonder … if Pruitt were afflicted with cancer, would he not want scientists discussing with him, let alone researching, the possible causes and solutions? Wouldn’t want to upset him. Frauds like Pruitt like to say that the climate has been changing since long before any human drove a car, so how could humans be causing climate change? Of course they aren’t solely responsible. The climate has always changed by itself through its own natural variability. But that doesn’t mean that humans can’t exacerbate or disrupt this natural variability by warming the planet even more and, by doing so, making the hots hotter, the wets wetter, the storms harsher, the colds colder and the droughts drier. That is why I prefer the term “global weirding” over “global warming.” The weather does get warmer in some places, but it gets weird in others. Look at the past few months: Not only were several big U.S. cities slammed by monster hurricanes, but San Francisco set a heat record — 106 degrees on Sept. 1, a day when the average high there is 70 degrees; the West was choked by record-breaking forest fires exacerbated by drought; and South Asia was slammed by extraordinarily harsh monsoons, killing some 1,400 people. But what if we prepare for disruptive climate change and it doesn’t get as bad as feared? Where will we be? Well, we will have cleaner air to breathe, less childhood asthma, more innovative building materials and designs, and cleaner, more efficient power generation and transportation systems — all of which will be huge export industries and create tens of thousands of good, repeat jobs. Because with world population steadily rising, we all will need greener cars and power if we just want to breathe clean air, no matter what happens with the climate. We will also be less dependent on petro-dictators. Indeed, it is safe to say, that if we overprepare for climate change and nothing much happens, it will be exactly like training for the Olympic marathon and the Olympics get canceled. You’re left with a body that is stronger, fitter and healthier. Trump has recently fired various knuckle-headed aides whose behavior was causing him short-term embarrassment. The person he needs to fire is Scott Pruitt. Pruitt is going to cause Trump long-term embarrassment. But instead, together they are authoring a new national security doctrine — one that says when faced with a low-probability, high-impact event like North Korea, the U.S. should spend any amount of money, and if the threat doesn’t materialize, well, we’ll have a lot of Army surplus and scrap metal. But when faced with an actually high-probability, high-impact threat called climate change, we should do nothing and poke both our eyes out, even though if the impact is less severe — and we prepare for it anyway — we will be left healthier, stronger, more productive, more resilient and more respected around the world. That is the Pruitt-Trump Doctrine — soon to be known as “Trump’s Folly.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Global Democracy Retreat,"Op-Ed Contributor Under the leadership of Donald Trump and Rex Tillerson, the State Department is considering a mission reform that includes the abandonment of democratic assistance and human rights. The current mission statement reads, “The department’s mission is to shape and sustain a peaceful, prosperous, just and democratic world and foster conditions for stability and progress for the benefit of the American people and people everywhere.” Dropping the words “just” and “democratic” would be fully consistent with the transactional realism that has characterized Mr. Trump’s rhetoric. And such a change might reflect a growing feeling that most of the programs to support democracy abroad and the importance of democratic ideals are wasteful, inefficient, unappreciated or even damaging. In America, the public (especially Republicans) has increasingly favored nationalism and isolationism, according to some polls, in which the United States focuses on its own problems, with many wary of global humanitarian engagement. But such a shift in United States foreign policy would be a historic mistake, abandoning America’s deepest values, eroding international commitments to human rights, and setting off dismay among friends and joy among foes around the globe. It would be the ultimate symbol of the end of American leadership in the world. This commitment to democracy is far from recent; it has been a red thread running through decades of bipartisan American foreign policy. A century ago, on April 2, 1917, during a speech asking Congress to declare war on Germany, Woodrow Wilson delivered one of the most resonant lines in the history of the American presidency: “The world must be made safe for democracy.” In 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, in the Atlantic Charter, committed the World War II allies to protect “the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.” And since then, democratic ideals have been articulated in speeches by every president, Republican and Democratic. Under President Trump, however, priorities have shifted. As one important indicator, when speaking about the State Department budget for fiscal year 2018, Mr. Tillerson’s statement was silent about human rights and democracy: “This budget request reflects the president’s ‘America First’ agenda that prioritizes the well-being of Americans, bolsters U.S. national security, secures our borders, and advances U.S. economic interests.” The budget proposes slashing spending for the sector on “governing justly and democratically” to $1.6 billion in 2018 from $2.3 billion in 2016. This may sound like a lot of taxpayer money, but it is a drop in the bucket compared with the $658 billion for fighter jets, ships, helicopters and troops approved by the House in late July. The Agency for International Development and State Department use the resources for programs on rule of law and human rights, good governance, political competition (including spending on elections and political parties) and civil society. It is impossible to demonstrate the value of programs in democracy, governance and human rights on a dollar-and-cents basis. But when we drill down to the details for programs of international assistance intended to strengthen democratic governance around the world, my research demonstrates that many standard interventions do work: for example, quota policies increasing the number of women in elected office; training that improves the skills of local electoral officials; and constitutional and legal reforms. Some risky investments may not pay off. Some countries — like Venezuela, Poland and Hungary — have clearly moved toward autocracy in recent years. In the longer term, however, as Freedom House, an American watchdog organization, demonstrates, there have been widespread gains worldwide. Progress is often incremental and rarely featured in newspaper headlines — but it happens all the time. Advancing democracy and human rights helps to generate the underlying conditions most favorable to peace and stability, ensure the delivery of public services, and build allies and friends. It is also, quite simply, the right thing for America to do. As the United States has been one of the leading actors promoting democracy and human rights worldwide, any abandonment of this work sends damaging diplomatic signals about America’s priorities. Of course the promotion of democracy and human rights abroad has sometimes proved more rhetorical than real in cases of United States foreign policy where these values have clashed with other economic or military priorities, especially in Latin America. Today, democracy promotion is colored by memories of the neocon adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan during the administration of George W. Bush. The Obama years saw a more cautious approach in foreign policy than under the neoconservatives. As one important indicator of changing priorities, the total amount of foreign assistance allocated for democracy, human rights and governance dropped by half under the Obama administration, to $1.9 billion in 2015 from $3.5 billion in 2010, before recovering ground in 2016 at $2.72 billion. The foreign policy of the Trump administration is likely to accelerate a new global wave of decline for human rights, indicated by the shrinking number of democratic regimes around the world and the resurgence of authoritarianism, encouraging a newly assertive Russia. Even under the basic principles of transactional realism, this is not in America’s interests.",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Inaugural Committee to Donate $3 Million to Hurricane Relief,"President Trump’s inaugural committee, under fire for a delay in donating its remaining funds to charity, plans to give $3 million to three organizations involved in hurricane rescue efforts, officials said on Tuesday. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., chairman of the private Presidential Inaugural Committee, said the money will be divided equally among three groups — the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical group. All three groups are involved in relief efforts after a string of hurricanes that ravaged the Gulf Coast, Florida and the Caribbean. “The surplus of these privately donated funds will be put to great substantive use for relief victims throughout the heartbreaking regions of America impacted by the recent catastrophic disasters,” Mr. Barrack said in an email. “The committee will continue to curate worthwhile causes and make further contributions that serve America’s agenda and will conclude in accordance with its charter in the next few months,” he added. The committee raised $107 million for the inauguration, a record amount, accepting corporate individual donations in amounts up to $1 million. It remains unclear how much money the committee still has, and officials declined to say. They said they anticipated additional costs before winding down the committee. A spokeswoman for Melania Trump, the first lady, has said that some of the leftover funds have been used for renovations to the White House and Naval Observatory, home of the vice president. Mr. Barrack said the charities were involved in “disasters across America’s geographic palate.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Insults for Foreign Leaders and Athletes,"Letter To the Editor: Re “The Day the Real Patriots Took a Knee” (editorial, Sept. 25): I am reminded of a poignant observation by the 19th-century French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville: “America is great because America is good.

I yearn for a campaign with the slogan “Make America Good Again.” BETSEY STEEGER, NEW YORK",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s N.F.L. Critique a Calculated Attempt to Shore Up His Base,"WASHINGTON — President Trump was restless on the flight home from his rally on Friday night in Alabama, griping about the size of the crowd, wondering how his pink tie played with his audience and fretting about the low energy of the Senate candidate he was there to bolster. But there was one part of the trip that cheered him up, according to three people close to the president: rallygoers’ thunderous approval of his attack on Colin Kaepernick, a former N.F.L. quarterback, for kneeling in protest during the national anthem, a slam punctuated by an epithet-laced suggestion that team owners fire employees who disrespect patriotic tradition. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump, while with a small group of advisers in the dining room of his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., asked a few members what they thought of his attack on Mr. Kaepernick. The response, according to one Trump associate, was polite but decidedly lukewarm. Mr. Trump responded by telling people that it was a huge hit with his base, making it clear that he did not mind alienating his critics if it meant solidifying his core support. “The president’s critics have it wrong,” Kellyanne Conway, a White House adviser who served as Mr. Trump’s campaign manager and pollster in 2016, said Monday. “They call him impulsive. He is intuitive.” Mr. Trump is seldom at a loss for motives in picking a public fight, and conflict seems to soothe him in the way that it unnerves others. He loved getting a rise from the players and owners who linked arms in solidarity before Sunday’s slate of football games, aides and associates said. His satisfaction was blighted only by the disapproval expressed by his friend Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots. The president’s provocations are a real-time expression of his emotions in the moment and his feel for a crowd. More than anything, such fights are a reflection of his focus on what it takes to keep his restive populist base behind him, and a ritual of self-preservation intended to divert attention from other, more damaging narratives. But this time, Mr. Trump, who tends to lash out when attacked, seemed to make his comments during comparative quiescence, with majorities of Americans approving of his response to the recent hurricanes and a stopgap budget deal with Democrats that took leaders in his party by surprise. But White House officials say the president is deeply worried that his recent show of bipartisanship on the budget and on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program with two Democratic leaders — Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer — endangers his standing with the base. Mr. Trump, according to the officials, believes his decision to back Luther Strange — a struggling establishment conservative in the Alabama Senate race and the reason Mr. Trump went to Alabama — makes him appear weak. He has repeatedly expressed unhappiness with his political team for persuading him to back Mr. Strange, who has drawn opposition from many of Mr. Trump’s supporters, including Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, and not his opponent, Roy Moore, a former judge. For those reasons, Mr. Trump leaned right harder than usual on Friday night. He chided Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for opposing his latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he ridiculed North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as the “Little Rocket Man.” He also offered the most tempered of support for his purported ally, Mr. Strange — “Big Luther” to the president. But his most conspicuous targets were the highly paid athletes, most of them black, who during the playing of the national anthem at football games have protested police brutality and what they say is the systematic racism behind it. The vehemence was tactical, but also visceral. Mr. Trump has often taken a dim view of race-based protest and, as the onetime owner of a football franchise in a failed start-up league, he believes owners of sports teams should control their employees. His top staff was not nearly as enthusiastic, a senior administration official said. There were complaints from some officials that his tweets created another public relations headache at a time when the White House was scrambling to deal with a looming loss on health care, a dangerous escalation in the war of words with North Korea and complicated negotiations over the centerpiece of the president’s legislative agenda, tax reform. But John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, dismissed such complaints, telling other aides he fully supported the president’s move and that there was no good time for such a conversation. “Every American should take the three minutes or so that it takes for the national anthem to play to stand up, remove their hat, put their hand over their heart and think about the men and women that have been named, sacrificing their lives, so that song can be played in the stadium,” Mr. Kelly, a former four-star Marine general, said in a statement late Monday. “After that happens, folks should feel free to do whatever they want to do to express their opinions.” Mr. Trump, posting on Twitter on Monday evening, said that claims that Mr. Kelly had opposed his attack were a “total lie!” What happened in prominent cases in which blacks were killed by the police or died in police custody. Still, it was a reprise of a formula the president used repeatedly during the 2016 presidential campaign — digging in on one side of an inflammatory issue amid praise from conservatives, and enjoying the spectacle of his critics condemning him. “He intuitively understands that making compromise with the Democrats is sort of the opposite of what he told his base he was going to do,” said Alex Conant, a veteran Republican consultant who was part of Senator Marco Rubio’s campaign team in 2016. “It’s not a coincidence that the same week he did the DACA deal that he just flooded Twitter with a bunch of red meat for the base,” Mr. Conant added. “I think his fundamental problem is he needs to figure out ways to grow his base, and his instinct is instead to double down on what he’s already got. Whenever he tacks to the middle, his numbers tick up. But he just can’t bring himself to move beyond his base.” That is not how Mr. Trump sees it. In private, the president and his top aides freely admit that he is engaged in a culture war on behalf of his white, working-class base, a New York billionaire waging war against “politically correct” coastal elites on behalf of his supporters in the South and in the Midwest. He believes the war was foisted upon him by former President Barack Obama and other Democrats — and he is determined to win, current and former aides said. After his criticism of athletes over the weekend, Mr. Trump made a point of praising Nascar drivers early Monday morning after the national anthem at a race on Sunday went off without protest. In another tweet on Monday morning, Mr. Trump repeated his assertion that his position about protesting the national anthem was about patriotism. “The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race,” he said. “It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!” Mr. Trump’s football tweets came just before a Monday evening dinner at the White House with several Christian evangelical leaders, conservative activists from the Koch political network and Leonard A. Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society. Mr. Trump at one point asked those in attendance if evangelical voters were aware of what he has done in office, citing their support in the campaign, according to an attendee. Some at the dinner praised his criticism of the N.F.L., and the president replied that his remarks had “caught on.”",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Next Move on Health Care? Choice for Secretary May Offer Clue,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s selection of a secretary of health and human services could be a turning point in a health care debate that has polarized Washington, as he faces a choice of working with Democrats to fix the current system or continuing his so-far failed efforts to dismantle his predecessor’s program. The resignation of Tom Price as secretary late Friday over his use of costly chartered jets capped a week of setbacks on health care for a president who made the issue a centerpiece of his campaign and his first eight months in office. Mr. Trump’s decision on a successor could be an opportunity to shift the debate, but he faces the prospect of an arduous confirmation battle. The president has sent mixed signals since the latest effort to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act collapsed in the Senate. He asserted that he had the votes to pass the repeal legislation in early 2018, while offering to negotiate with Democrats who are adamantly against it. One adviser said on Saturday that Mr. Trump was serious about compromising with Democrats and would pick a secretary who would help make that happen. Democrats urged him to pursue such a course. “Let’s get a new H.H.S. secretary who’s finally devoted to improving health care, move past these debates and come to bipartisan agreement on how to stabilize markets and make health care cheaper,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the departure of Mr. Price could begin “a new chapter for the Trump administration’s health care agenda.” The White House had no comment on Saturday, but two advisers who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters said two top candidates were Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Both have previously been vetted by the White House, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate to their current jobs within recent months, a significant selling point. Other names have been floated as well, including David Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs and a favorite of the president’s. But he has been criticized for a European trip with his wife that mixed business and sightseeing and was partially financed by taxpayers, and Mr. Trump may be reluctant to move him because he has been critical to fixing veterans’ care. Some reports floated former Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, an assistant secretary of health and human services under President George W. Bush. But he was a caustic critic of Mr. Trump during his own brief campaign for the White House that ended in late 2015 after he called the future president a “narcissist” and “egomaniacal madman.” Mr. Trump may not necessarily fill the post quickly. He has left the Department of Homeland Security in the hands of an acting secretary since John F. Kelly left in July to become White House chief of staff. The president appears to be in no rush to fill that post despite a series of hurricanes and a roiling immigration debate, issues managed by the Department of Homeland Security. He said on Friday that he would make a decision on that nomination “probably within a month.” If Mr. Trump picks Ms. Verma to succeed Mr. Price at the Department of Health and Human Services, it would be taken as a sign among many that he wants to continue vigorous opposition to the Affordable Care Act, with the government doing the minimum required by the law to implement its provisions. Ms. Verma, an ally of Vice President Mike Pence, worked closely this year with Republicans in Congress on their proposals to undo the law and to cut Medicaid, the program for more than 70 million low-income people. Still, some progressives have interpreted her work under the health care law in Indiana, where Mr. Pence was governor, to mean that while she opposed the Affordable Care Act, she was committed to finding ways to enforce it if it remained on the books. Mr. Gottlieb has more experience in Washington and was seen at the time of his appointment as the more moderate of candidates being considered. In his first months at the F.D.A., he has deftly balanced the concerns of patients and pharmaceutical companies, while taking steps to combat the opioid epidemic and speed access to lower-cost generic drugs. His nomination would be seen as a signal that the president might want to take a different approach to the health care debate. “We have the votes on the substance but not necessarily on the process, which is why we’re still confident that we can move health care forward and get it done in the spring,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said before Mr. Price’s resignation. After the latest legislative failure, Mr. Trump said he would sign an executive order in the coming week intended to enable Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, a sign that he did not intend to wait for Congress. But it is not clear that he has the authority to do that on his own, and states often resist federal efforts to intrude on their regulation of insurers. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the panel’s ranking Democrat, have resumed negotiations on bipartisan legislation intended to shore up the current insurance exchanges and prevent prices from shooting up. The uncertainty comes at a crucial moment, just as federal and state officials are preparing for the fifth annual open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act. The open season, when people can sign up for coverage, runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15. Critics say that the Trump administration has destabilized insurance markets, driving up premiums for 2018 and making it harder for people to enroll. Mr. Price was confirmed in February by a party-line vote of 52 to 47 after giving vague, noncommittal answers about how he intended to carry out the Affordable Care Act. Confirmation of his successor could be an even sharper battle. Democrats may not have the votes to block confirmation, but they could drag out the process and make it excruciatingly difficult for the nominee and the White House. Democrats expect to press the new nominee for more specific answers to questions like these: Will the administration support bipartisan efforts to continue critically important payments to insurance companies, payments that Mr. Trump has threatened to cut off? Why has the president slashed funds for advertising, outreach and education programs and assistance to consumers who want to sign up for health insurance this fall? Neither Ms. Verma nor Mr. Gottlieb had easy confirmations to their current posts, but neither seems as strongly determined to undermine the Affordable Care Act as Mr. Price was. Ms. Verma, who earned a bachelor’s degree in life sciences at the University of Maryland and a master’s degree in public health at Johns Hopkins University, founded her own health policy consulting firm, SVC, and worked with state agencies to carry out the Affordable Care Act. Working with Mr. Pence when he was governor, she was the architect of the Healthy Indiana Plan, which expanded Medicaid under the Obama-era law. Rather than simply refusing to participate, as many Republican-led states did, Indiana under the program shaped by Ms. Verma expanded eligibility while emphasizing “personal responsibility” by requiring beneficiaries to pay premiums and contribute to health savings accounts, and giving them incentives for healthy behavior. Republicans saw that as a model for conservative enactment of the program, while Democrats criticized what they saw as roadblocks for low-income Americans. She was confirmed to her current post in March on a largely party-line 55-to-43 vote. Mr. Gottlieb, who received a bachelor’s degree in economics from Wesleyan University and a medical degree from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, served in several posts during President George W. Bush’s administration, including deputy commissioner of the F.D.A. While in the private sector, he worked as a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and served as a consultant for pharmaceutical companies. Republicans said that experience would make him a formidable commissioner because he would understand the business better, while Democrats said it made him too cozy with the industry he would regulate. While a physician, Mr. Gottlieb has also experienced the industry as a patient, having been successfully treated for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. After promising to divest himself from several health care companies and recuse himself for one year from decisions involving those businesses, he was confirmed in May on a 57-to-42 vote.",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Phone Buddy in North Korea Crisis: Shinzo Abe,"TOKYO — President Trump has made some rocky telephone calls to other heads of state in his seven and a half months in office. But he can always count on one world leader for a good chat: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Ever since the pair met in November at Trump Tower in New York just days after the presidential election, they have had a warm relationship that goes well beyond the typical partnership between two longstanding allies. “It is very unusual,” said Mitoji Yabunaka, a longtime diplomat and former vice minister at Japan’s Foreign Ministry. “It did not happen that way in the past.” Since Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January, he and Mr. Abe have met in person three times, golfed together once and talked by telephone 13 times, more than Mr. Abe spoke to President Barack Obama in his last four years in office. Over the past week alone, Mr. Abe and Mr. Trump have spoken by telephone four times. “The president responds to Abe as a buddy and a friend,” said Sheila A. Smith, a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “And Abe has worked hard to cultivate that kind of relationship with him.” To be sure, with the North Korean nuclear crisis escalating and a missile flying directly over Japan last week, they have ample reason to chat. But that same logic applies to South Korea, and relations between Mr. Trump and his counterpart there, President Moon Jae-in, are decidedly chillier. Mr. Trump waited until the day after Sunday’s nuclear test in North Korea to call Mr. Moon, while he talked to Mr. Abe twice the day it happened, once before and once after the test. Analysts sift through the terse accounts that both the White House and Mr. Abe’s office release describing their conversations. The word “ironclad” appears frequently to characterize the alliance between the two nations. As North Korea has come to dominate the conversation, the reports inevitably include censure of the North’s actions, with Mr. Trump recently saying that the United States was prepared to defend America’s allies “using the full range of diplomatic, conventional and nuclear capabilities at our disposal.” In talking to Mr. Trump frequently, Mr. Abe is partly ensuring that those guarantees remain in place, advisers say, given how erratic Mr. Trump can be, sometimes appearing to change policy direction between tweets. The worry is that the promises of yesterday might not hold today. A person familiar with the thinking of Mr. Abe and his cabinet who is not authorized to speak publicly said that given the unpredictable pronouncements from the Trump administration, Mr. Abe wants to keep in close contact to ensure there are no misunderstandings. The Japanese news media have seized on that unpredictability. In a morning news show on Asahi Television the day after the North’s sixth nuclear test, commentators wondered how to reconcile Mr. Trump’s “Talking is not the answer!” tweet from a few days earlier with comments from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis suggesting diplomacy is still an option. “National policy is not clear,” read a graphic on the screen. “It is still valuable to reconfirm that they have common goals and a common set of strategies or tactics,” said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat now teaching at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. “Once is not enough. Reconfirmation should be continual and frequent. All the options are on the table. If the options are limited, you don’t have to” keep talking. Aside from the search for clarity, the telephone calls — which often coincide with calls between Japan’s defense or foreign ministers and their American counterparts — reflect the alignment of two conservative and nationalistic administrations. Although Mr. Abe had expected Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election, his cabinet has found a more simpatico national security leadership in Mr. Trump’s circle. Mr. Abe, himself a hard-liner who has called for increasing Japan’s military power, also appreciates the tough talk against North Korea, say analysts. “I think the Japanese government wants to see some demonstration of American resolve,” said Michael J. Green, a former Asia adviser to President George W. Bush who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “And saber rattling does not alarm the Japanese government as much as it does the South Korean government,” which has called for more diplomatic and economic engagement with North Korea. There are some risks for Mr. Abe, as the Japanese public is understandably squeamish about the prospect of a nuclear war on their doorstep given the country’s own history with it. But the frequency of the phone calls between Mr. Abe and Mr. Trump also simply demonstrates the personal chemistry between the two men. Mr. Abe was the first world leader to visit Mr. Trump after he won the election, and they spent hours playing golf at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in February. During that visit, they bonded over the North Korean challenge when the North test-fired a ballistic missile while the leaders were having dinner. While other world leaders have criticized Mr. Trump for his decision to withdraw from the Paris accord on climate change and for his comments about white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Abe can be a safe harbor. “Mr. Abe provides him with a world leader who reaffirms Trump’s own leadership and says, ‘O.K., I am looking to you, I am depending on you, you’re the guy and I’m going to stand with you wherever you go,’” said Daniel C. Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University. “And I think Trump needs that.” By contrast, President Barack Obama did not feel the need to talk to Mr. Abe as frequently, said an American diplomat in Japan who served during the Obama presidency and was not authorized to speak publicly. From Mr. Abe’s perspective, the frequent calls also demonstrate strength to North Korea, as well as China, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on to solve the North Korean crisis. The calls between the two leaders “primarily send a message to North Korea,” said Hajime Izumi, a professor of international relations and Korean politics at Tokyo International University. But he said Mr. Abe also “wants China to sweat more.” Mr. Abe stands out among world leaders for staving off censure from a president who during the campaign criticized Japanese trade barriers and suggested Japan pay a greater share of the cost of United States military support. “Abe is one of the few Asian leaders who has been able to pretty deftly navigate the unpredictability and eccentricities of Trump to his substantial advantage,” said Evan S. Medeiros, who served as senior director on Asia in the National Security Council during the Obama administration. Some critics accuse Mr. Abe of being too sycophantic in pursuit of a bromance with Mr. Trump. But analysts say there is little to be gained by disagreeing with the president. “It may be that President Trump is profoundly unpopular around the world,” said Mr. Green. “But if you are the prime minister of Japan and you have the opportunity to shape this almost unshapeable president, it’s in your national interest to do that.” One way the relationship could cool is if Mr. Abe finds himself in conflict with other leaders he is courting. On Thursday, he will meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in Vladivostok, a leader whom Mr. Abe has pursued assiduously. Russia is likely to want to mediate the North Korean crisis and may diverge from the American approach. “Putin is going to push him to do what they want to do,” Mr. Sneider said. “And we don’t know if that conflicts with what Trump wants to do.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Selective Devotion to Law and Order,"Andrew Rosenthal Republicans — like President Trump, for instance — love to puff up their chests, grasp their lapels and declaim in foghorn voices about their devotion to law and order. And so, on Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, piously declared that the Justice Department should consider whether James Comey had broken the law before and after Trump fired him as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “I think if there’s ever a moment where we feel someone’s broken the law, particularly if they’re the head of the F.B.I., I think that’s something that certainly should be looked at,” she said. She was referring to Comey’s exoneration of Hillary Clinton in the email caper, and his admission that he had leaked his own private memo describing conversations with Trump. It couldn’t get clearer than that, right? Not so fast. On a Friday night in August, when Hurricane Harvey was barreling into Texas, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County, Ariz.a, sheriff who had blatantly violated a court order to stop detaining people because he thought they looked Mexican. It didn’t bother President Law and Order that he undercut the courts’ only power to enforce their orders. His praise of Arpaio as being “very strong” on lawbreaking by border crossers did not mention that the former sheriff fed his victims rotten food in outdoor detention camps where temperatures soared and some prisoners even died. Or that he failed to investigate about 400 sex crimes. Under the Trump formula, Comey should be investigated by the Justice Department — but Michael Flynn, who had to resign in disgrace as national security adviser, should get a pass for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his meetings with the Russian ambassador. On Wednesday, we learned that Democrats in Congress are asking questions about another memory slip by Flynn — failing to disclose a trip he took in 2015 to try to broker a Saudi-Russian deal on nuclear power plants — and that he may have lobbied inside the White House for that deal. Because in Trump World, Flynn is a “good” guy, while Comey is not — and, that’s what this is all about. It’s a dark, twisted version of the “naughty and nice lists,” as reimagined by someone whose heart is at least two sizes too small. Thus, Hillary Clinton should be “locked up” for her witless handling of her email server years ago, but Donald Trump Jr. should not be called to account for meeting last year with Kremlin agents to get “dirt” on Clinton, or later telling tall tales about the meeting. The Trump Naughty list covers all undocumented immigrants (including those brought here as children) from Latin America and refugees of most kinds, especially Muslims. Then there are the Americans who visited a website that organized protests against Trump after the election. The Justice Department wants their internet addresses — 1.3 million of them — and a District of Columbia judge in Washington actually approved the warrant with the ridiculous argument that he would review the information to protect “innocent” people. That would be all 1.3 million. So their constitutional rights should be trampled in Trumpland. Yet we should respect those of the armed thugs who gathered in Charlottesville, Va., to defend symbols of racism in American history. The law-and-order president wants to target journalists who cover his administration in ways he doesn’t like, subjecting them to leak investigations and, he has darkly hinted, perhaps a curtailment of their First Amendment rights. The global Naughty List includes Kim Jong-un of North Korea, who should be there. But it excludes other bloodthirsty autocrats, like Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, the Saudi royal family and Vladimir Putin. Trump this week welcomed Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia, who is under investigation by the Justice Department for corruption. Trump, of course, has his priorities straight. The Razak visit, he said, was about “very large trade deals” and Malaysia’s status as a “massive investor” in this country. Razak, no doubt by sheer coincidence, stayed at the Trump hotel in Washington. Really, the Nice List is not so mysterious. To get on it, be a member of Trump’s family, support him with unquestioning and sycophantic loyalty, rule your country through blood and fear — or just throw money his way.

2017,Trump’s Support for Law to Protect ‘Dreamers’ Lifts Its Chances,"WASHINGTON — An unexpected meeting of the minds between President Trump and Democratic leaders on Thursday made real a possible deal in Congress to pair enhanced border security with legislation to protect young, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. One day after Mr. Trump hosted Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi for dinner at the White House, the president said he could support legislation to protect the young immigrants known as “Dreamers” from deportation if it were accompanied by a “massive” border security upgrade. Acceding to a key Democratic demand, Mr. Trump said such a package did not need to have funding for a border wall. It was the second time this month that a tentative agreement announced by Democrats left Republican leaders in Congress scrambling to adjust a legislative agenda that appears increasingly set by the party out of power in the House, the Senate and the White House. “We’re working on a plan for DACA,” Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to protections for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as he prepared to leave the White House for Florida. He added, “The wall will come later.” And Republican leaders at least sounded open to pursuing it. “We’re not going to bring a solution to the floor that does not have the support of President Trump,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin told reporters. But if Mr. Trump does support an immigration package that includes “security and enforcement,” he said, so will “a majority of our members, because our members support President Trump.” But he also made his frustration clear. “The president understands he has to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution,” Mr. Ryan said. Mr. Trump’s comments, at a time when Republicans had hoped to focus on rewriting the tax code, came amid a chaotic day of back and forth on Capitol Hill over what, precisely, had emerged from Wednesday’s White House dinner — and where Mr. Trump’s newfound alliance with Democrats might lead. On Thursday morning, the president telephoned Republican leaders to relay news of the dinner discussions; Republicans were left on the defensive, and seemingly flummoxed. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, issued a curt statement saying he and his colleagues “look forward to receiving the Trump administration’s legislative proposal,” while Mr. Ryan called Wednesday night’s talks “a discussion, not an agreement or a negotiation.” Leaving the issue in Mr. Trump’s hands could prove beneficial for Republicans, ridding them of a difficult job. A person familiar with the discussions said Mr. McConnell welcomed Mr. Trump being the Republicans’ point man on immigration after the two presidents before him failed to come up with a plan and the party remained split on how to deal with the issue. Some Republican lawmakers openly welcomed Washington’s newly changed immigration landscape. “I think President Trump has a chance to be on immigration what President Nixon was on China; he has a lot of credibility on the issue,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. “I think if the president recommended a solution to Congress and the American people, they might very well accept it.” However, many Republican lawmakers fear that Mr. Trump, who has not had a background in crafting legislation, might end up signing legislation written by Democrats, which would infuriate many conservative voters. Some conservatives pushed back hard. Representative Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican and member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, said a wall on the southern border was “what the whole election was about.” He added that any bill that offers legal status to undocumented immigrants would send the wrong message. “You say to the rest of the world, ‘Hey, as long as you get into the U.S., the green light is on and eventually you are going to get to stay permanently,’” he said. “That will lead to a huge inflow.” Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who has been a consistent advocate of legislation to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, cheered Mr. Trump on. “The president is trying to cut a deal that I think would be good for the country as a whole.” As lawmakers discussed Mr. Trump’s intentions, the House on Thursday actually passed a get-tough measure called the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, aimed at MS-13 and other immigrant gangs. Critics and immigration rights advocates said the measure would codify racial profiling. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump announced he would phase out DACA, begun by President Barack Obama, but would give lawmakers six months to come up with something to replace it. The program benefits about 800,000 young immigrants, including those brought to the United States illegally as children, and others who have overstayed their visas. But at this point, any legislative proposal on the so-called Dreamers may have to come from the minority party — a highly unusual situation in a Congress where Republicans control both legislative chambers, with a Republican in the White House. In an interview Thursday, Mr. Schumer said he and Ms. Pelosi arrived at Wednesday’s dinner prepared with a specific list of border security items that Democrats could agree to, drawn from Mr. Trump’s own budget request. They included sensors to beef up border monitoring, rebuilding roads along the border, drones and air support for border enforcement. “I told the president that there’s tremendous distrust in our caucuses, in our constituencies and in the public, and I mentioned a litany of things such as the Muslim ban and Charlottesville,” Mr. Schumer said, referring to the president’s travel ban on immigrants from six Muslim-majority nations, and to Mr. Trump’s equivocal remarks about white supremacists after the violence in Charlottesville, Va. “And I said for us to get something done we need to establish some trust,” Mr. Schumer added. He said the next step will be for Democratic leadership aides to meet with White House counterparts to “sit down and figure out a border security package that we can all agree on.” That would be paired with the so-called Dream Act, legislation dating back to 2001 that would shield young immigrants from deportation and offer a path to citizenship. “We’re all going to support the Dream Act and we’re going to push for it to get on the floor soon,” Mr. Schumer said. “That part is agreed to.” Republicans accused Mr. Schumer of moving the goal posts. DACA offered temporary legal status to young, undocumented immigrants, and allowed them to live and work without fear of deportation. But it was not as expansive as the Dream Act. In Florida, Mr. Trump said flatly that any package would not offer a path to citizenship, and added that he intended to work with Republicans as well. “No, we’re not looking at citizenship,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re not looking at amnesty. We’re looking at allowing people to stay here. We’re working with everybody — Republican. We’re working with Democrat. I just spoke with Paul Ryan, he’s on board. Everybody is on board. They want to do something. We’re not talking about amnesty. We’re talking about — we’re talking about taking care of people, people that were brought here, people that have done a good job and were not brought here of their own volition.” In an unscripted moment on the Senate floor Thursday, Mr. Schumer was caught on a microphone sounding enthusiastic about the Democrats’ new comity with Mr. Trump. “He likes us; he likes me anyway,” the Democratic leader was overheard saying. He went on: “Here’s what I told him, I said, ‘Mr. President, you’re much better off if you sometimes step right and you sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction, you’re boxed.’ He gets that.” But while Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi were reveling in their seemingly newfound clout, they faced misgivings from their left and from Hispanics, who worry that the fate of young immigrants is now paired with a push for increased border security. “Why are we discussing border security?” asked Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois. “I thought we were discussing DACA. So already you see the slippery slope of the conversation.’’ He added, “I hope and pray that Pelosi and Schumer are more sophisticated and smarter than everyone else that’s been duped by Donald Trump.” Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, Democrat of New Mexico and chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said she along with the heads of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus met with Mr. Schumer on Thursday afternoon to discuss the agreement. Ms. Grisham said she would be in favor of a legislative fix that would split the issues of border security and the DACA beneficiaries into two separate bills.",The New York Times
2017,"Opinion | Trump’s Tax Proposal: Who Wins, Who Loses?","Letters To the Editor: Re “Sweeping Trump Tax Plan Vague on Details and Cost” (front page, Sept. 28): Low corporate tax rates might seem like a good thing for America’s economy, but too much of a good thing typically carries with it unintended consequences. For example, the last round of Canadian corporate tax reductions (from 22.1 percent to 15 percent) removed in excess of $12 billion yearly from federal tax revenues, materially adding to yearly deficits and overall debt. The vast majority of those Canadian corporate tax windfalls went not into job creation or investment in Canada but rather to share buybacks, bonuses and investments internationally. A corporate tax rate drop in America from 35 percent to 20 percent is sure to end in many of the same results. The Trump administration would, in effect, be borrowing money, adding debt and deepening yearly deficits to pay for that corporate tax cut. As the government’s yearly revenues diminish, less and less money will be available to address the expanding social, environmental, education and economic needs of an America looking to make itself great once again. EDWARD CARSON, TORONTO To the Editor: The proposed tax plan removes most itemized deductions except mortgage interest and charitable donations. In return, it almost doubles the standard deduction for all filing categories. I assume the motive for retaining these two deductions is to placate various interest groups such as the real estate industry and religious institutions. However, this appears to be an additional benefit only for the wealthy. A married couple would have to give very large donations and/or have a sizable mortgage to cross the threshold of the standard deduction. For the average home buyer, the tax deduction for interest will be a thing of the past. The same reasoning holds true for charitable donations. For these deductions to remain and benefit everyone, they should be separate line item deductions in addition to the standard deduction. As proposed they remain a benefit only to the wealthy. TODD BLOCKBOYNTON BEACH, FLA. To the Editor: In a press briefing on Thursday about the outlines of the tax plan, Gary Cohn, President Trump’s top economic adviser, said that average Americans are only interested in their own taxes and not how the tax plan would affect the wealthy. Not true. I am an average American and would like to know if the proposal benefits not only Mr. Trump and his family but other wealthy citizens as well. Mr. Cohn also stated that tax cuts to the middle class would result in an average savings of $1,000. “What does that mean? They can renovate their kitchen, they can buy a new car, they can take a family vacation,” he said. How could my whopping $83 a month tax savings begin to do this? I guess I could pick up a new faucet, buy a used Yugo or stay one night at a Trump hotel. LAWRENCE ABBOTT, BELMONT, ME.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Tax Push Begins,"David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. The debate over tax policy is going to become more intense this week. My column today tells a story from a half-century ago — about a man named George Romney, who voluntarily turned down a lot of money — as a way of introducing the debate. Taxes will become a focus because Congress returns today from its summer recess, with its Republican leaders and President Trump desperate for a legislative win. Having failed on health care policy, they’ve decided that a tax overhaul is their new goal. Later today, Trump is scheduled to meet at the White House with the so-called Big Six, a group of top administration officials and congressional leaders working on tax policy. In the coming weeks, you may sometimes find the subject to be mind-numbingly complicated. It’s tax policy, after all. But the core of the issue isn’t so complicated. The two overriding questions are: Will Trump and Congress pursue tax reform — that is, a simpler tax code, which has the potential to lift economic growth — or will they merely go for a tax cut? And if they choose the tax cut, will most of the benefits flow to the affluent? So far, unfortunately, the early signs point to a relatively straightforward tax cut that mostly benefits the wealthy. For more on that subject, I recommend Chye-Ching Huang and Howard Gleckman (both here and here). In The Times recently, Sarah Anderson debunked some myths about corporate taxes, and the Editorial Board offered an overview. I also encourage you to keep in mind the “Mnuchin test,” a vow from Trump’s Treasury secretary that the president’s tax plan would not be a handout to the wealthy. That same issue — the tax code’s fairness — is the subject of my column. On the news. The United States and South Korea are taking different approaches to Kim Jong-un’s nuclear aggression, which is deepening the crisis, explains The Financial Times’s Gideon Rachman. “There’s a difference in political philosophy between the hawkish Trump administration,” Rachman says, and a South Korean government “more inclined to look towards negotiation and some kind of accommodation with North Korea.” And Rose Cuison Villazor, a law professor at the University of California at Davis, helps sort through Trump’s apparent decision to expose Dreamers to deportation, in a Times op-ed.",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Travel Ban to Be Replaced by Restrictions Tailored to Certain Countries,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is replacing his ban on travelers from six majority-Muslim countries with severe restrictions on visitors from nations he has determined do too little to protect against terrorists and criminals coming into the United States, officials said on Friday. The new travel restrictions could include indefinite bans on entry until vetting procedures and security cooperation improves, officials said. They will go into effect as soon as Sunday, after the conclusion of a 90-day policy review undertaken as part of the administration’s original travel ban. Officials said Mr. Trump will soon announce the list of countries subject to the travel restrictions. They declined to say whether the list would include all six countries from which travel was temporarily banned by a revised executive order in March: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The president hinted that the changes were coming in a tweet after a crude bomb exploded on a London Underground train last week: “The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific,” Mr. Trump wrote. Officials said Mr. Trump was given a “decision brief” on the travel ban by senior officials during a meeting Friday at the president’s Bedminster club. The announcement is the culmination of the biggest legal challenge to Mr. Trump’s presidential authority since he took office. It came just over two weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in lawsuits that claim Mr. Trump exceeded his authority and defied the constitution by banning entry from the six countries. “We need to know who is coming into our country. We should be able to validate their identities,” said Miles Taylor, the counselor to the secretary of homeland security. He said the new restrictions represent a significant increase in toughening “national security standards and protecting the homeland.” The administration’s critics expressed deep reservations about the new restrictions and left open the possibility that they will file additional legal challenges once the list of countries is revealed. “We tend to look at anything coming out of this White House with a great deal of skepticism,” said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “While it has been clear that a neutral vetting system across the board needs to be looked at on its merits, this seems to be a third rescue of the failed Muslim ban.” In stark contrast to the original travel ban, which was implemented with virtually no notice only days after Mr. Trump took office, officials said the new travel restrictions were developed after intense negotiations with security officials in countries around the world. Those officials were given standards they must meet in order to avoid travel restrictions, including the ability to verify the identity of a traveler, communicate electronic passport information, use biometric devices and share information about terrorist and criminal networks with the United States. Countries that did not meet those standards as of mid-July were given 50 days to comply or face the threat of severe travel restrictions, officials said. “It was crystal clear,” Mr. Taylor told reporters on Friday. To countries who failed to meet or accept the new requirements, Mr. Taylor said, the message from American diplomats was blunt: “You will face potential consequences from the United States.” In the end, officials said that some of those countries added measures to improve security for passports and to better identify potential terrorist threats. They will not face additional travel restrictions. But other countries either could not meet the tougher vetting standards or willfully refused to engage with the United States government. People in the countries that will be identified by Mr. Trump will soon face new travel restrictions, officials said. “The Trump administration will ensure that the people who travel to the United States are properly vetted and those that don’t belong here aren’t allowed to enter,” said Jonathan Hoffman, the assistant secretary of homeland security for public affairs. Mr. Trump’s original ban blocked all travel to the United States by refugees as well as nationals of seven countries, including Iraq, which was later deemed to have improved its screening of potential travelers and was taken off the banned list. The ban caused chaos at airports around the country and prompted a torrent of criticism from immigrant rights activists, lawmakers in both parties, business executives, academic leaders and diplomats from around the world. A furious legal assault on the president’s travel ban delayed its implementation for months, as federal judges agreed with immigrant rights groups that the original ban unconstitutionally targeted a particular religion or exceeded the president’s statutory authority to block immigration. In June, the Supreme Court allowed the travel ban to take effect, with some significant restrictions, while the justices consider the merits of the case. The changes to be announced this weekend could have a profound impact on the court case, complicating the review by the justices and potentially making parts of the case moot even before the oral arguments, which are scheduled for Oct. 10. Officials from the Department of Justice declined to answer questions about whether they intend to take any actions related to the court case before the oral arguments. A spokesman for the department told reporters that “we are continuing to vigorously defend the president’s executive order.” The original travel ban included restrictions on entry into the United States by refugees from around the world. The new rules do not appear to alter the limits on refugees, leaving that question open for the Supreme Court to decide. The justices are likely to seek new input from lawyers for the government and for the groups challenging the travel ban before arguments begin. Restrictions on travel are not unique to the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security employs almost 2,000 people in about 80 countries around the world screening high-risk travelers seeking to visit the United States. For years, customs officers in the Immigration Advisory Program worked with airline employees and foreign security officials to review passenger ticketing data and examined documents in an attempt to detect fraud. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents and State Department counterterrorism officials are also stationed at diplomatic posts to screen visa applicants for ties to terrorism, drug smuggling and human trafficking and to help ensure that ineligible applicants do not receive visas. Dozens of officers at the National Targeting Center, which is run by Customs and Border Protection, have combed through passenger lists and cargo manifests since the days after the Sept. 11 attacks. Officers help identify which passengers should be subject to additional questioning by customs officers. Mr. Trump and his national security officials have argued from the beginning that the travel ban was intended to give the government time to ensure that those practices were sufficient to make sure that terrorists are not able to enter the United States using travel documents for people on vacation or seeking temporary employment. Critics accused the administration of basing threat assessments of travelers solely on the religion of the majority of people who lived in the nations identified by the executive order. Some counterterrorism experts say a targeted vetting system that screens individuals on a case-by-case basis makes more sense than a total ban on travelers from certain countries. “Vetting those coming to the United States against the broadest array of intelligence and law enforcement information is good security. Banning people because of their religion, ethnicity or country of origin is not good security and counter to our constitutional principles,” said John D. Cohen, a professor at Rutgers University and a former senior Homeland Security Department official during the Obama administration. Mr. Cohen other counterterrorism experts said the Trump administration should beef up the existing programs that are intended to prevent criminals and national security threats from entering the country.",The New York Times
2017,Trump’s Tweets About London Bombing Anger British Leaders,"WASHINGTON — President Trump seized on a terrorist attack in London on Friday to promote his ban on travel to the United States by Muslims and, in the process, ran afoul of Britain by claiming without evidence that the assailants had been “in the sights” of the British police. In a fusillade of early morning tweets, Mr. Trump cited the chaotic scene in a London Underground station as Exhibit A for his hard-line policies. His ban on visitors from predominantly Muslim countries, he wrote, should be “far larger, tougher and more specific” — a statement that seemed calculated to mollify his political base after a week in which Mr. Trump suddenly began playing dealmaker with Democrats on immigration. But Mr. Trump’s assertion that the assailants had been known to Scotland Yard angered Prime Minister Theresa May, who said it was not helpful for anyone to speculate while an investigation was underway. Mr. Trump was later briefed about the attack and called Mrs. May with condolences, according to a senior official, though he did not apologize. It was the latest episode in which Mr. Trump was at odds with Britain over sensitive security issues. In June, he criticized London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, over his response to another terrorist attack, misconstruing Mr. Khan’s words. In March, the White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, repeated allegations that a British intelligence agency had wiretapped Trump Tower, which British authorities dismissed as “utterly ridiculous.” Trump’s assertions were also a sign that for all the talk about a more disciplined White House under the new chief of staff, John F. Kelly — who has urged the president to have tweets vetted by his aides — Mr. Trump was still determined not to censor himself on social media and was fully capable of roiling the diplomatic waters with a single unguarded post. At 6:42 a.m., Mr. Trump tweeted that “sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard” carried out the attack, which injured at least 29 people in the blast and ensuing panic. It was not clear where Mr. Trump got that information, though 23 minutes earlier, “Fox & Friends,” a program he regularly watches, broadcast a report in which a security analyst said he feared that the London police had already known the identity of the attackers. “Can someone tell Scotland Yard?” asked Brian Kilmeade, one of the hosts of the program. White House officials tried to play down the contretemps, saying Mr. Trump was referring to the longstanding efforts of British law enforcement authorities to investigate would-be terrorists, not to anyone involved in Friday’s attack. “What the president was communicating is that obviously all of our law enforcement efforts are focused on this terrorist threat for years,” said the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. “Scotland Yard has been a leader, as our F.B.I. has been a leader.” The press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said she believed that Mr. Trump’s tweet had come up in the conversation with Mrs. May, though she did not characterize the exchange. Mr. Trump, for his part, referred to Mrs. May as “a wonderful woman.” But Mrs. May made her displeasure clear earlier in the day when she told reporters, “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.” Others were more scathing. Mrs. May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote on Twitter, “True or not — and I’m sure he doesn’t know — this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner.” The president has had a strained relationship with Britain since before he took office. Soon after he was elected, he suggested that Nigel Farage, a leader of Britain’s movement to leave the European Union, should be made the British ambassador to the United States — a decision that, London pointed out, was not Mr. Trump’s to make. Mrs. May and Mr. Trump have had an awkward relationship, going back to their first meeting, when people criticized the way he gripped her hand. Last month, she joined other world leaders in criticizing his response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. For Mr. Trump, the news of another terrorist attack also offered a moment to do some political repositioning by returning to themes that have animated him since the presidential campaign. After a week in which his pursuit of a compromise with Democrats on immigration rattled his supporters, the president appeared eager to seize on a range of red-meat issues to prove his bona fides. In addition to the travel ban, Mr. Trump said that no agreement protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children could include “chain migration” — shorthand among immigration restrictionists for laws that enable immigrants to petition the government for papers for family members. “Trump underestimated the reaction of throwing DACA out there for debate, and now he’s telling us he really wanted to use that to get all the things he could get on enforcement,” said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa and an immigration hard-liner. “I don’t think he realized the base was going to blow up on him.” Mr. Trump even weighed in on the dispute over Jemele Hill, a black female commentator at ESPN, who tweeted that the president was a “white supremacist.” “ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics,” he tweeted. “Apologize for untruth!” Ms. Hill has apologized, but Ms. Sanders said her comment was a “fireable offense.” Some polls have shown that the president’s political base would mostly support preserving Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which temporarily shields 800,000 young immigrants from deportation. But Mr. King said he was skeptical of those numbers. Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who conducted one of the surveys, said Mr. Trump was engaging in an exercise that he believes has been effective in the past. “He has an ability to hold up a shiny object and his base follows it unerringly, and he’s really good at it,” Mr. Newhouse said. Mr. Trump also does not hesitate to point fingers after suspicious explosions in European cities. Some counterterrorism experts were also asking whether Friday’s explosion was another instance in which the police overseas had mishandled tips about a possible attack. On “Fox & Friends” shortly before the president tweeted, Jim Hanson, a security analyst who served in the Army Special Forces, said, “My fear, again, is that we’re going to find out this is someone who is known to police.” A website for the firm Mr. Hanson runs, Security Studies Group, says it focuses on “defending the value of American power against the true threats we face” against a Washington elite that has been “unable or unwilling to address and communicate the most basic requirements of American nationhood.” Mr. Trump also took aim at the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack. He tweeted that his “proactive and nasty” military campaign against the jihadists had made more progress in eight months than the Obama administration had in eight years. And Mr. Trump used characteristically pungent language about the assailants themselves. “Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner,” he tweeted.",The New York Times
2017,"Trump’s Voter Fraud Panel, No Stranger to Controversy, Creates Another One","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s commission on voter fraud, which has ricocheted between controversies since its creation in May, is scheduled to hold its second public meeting on Tuesday in New Hampshire. Already, the commission’s de facto leader has warmed up for the session by suggesting that the election in November of Senator Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire Democrat, was rigged. The accusation led the state’s entire congressional delegation to demand that William M. Gardner, the New Hampshire secretary of state, resign from the commission. Mr. Gardner, a Democrat and the host of the meeting on Tuesday, refused to do so, and said the state’s two senators and two representatives were being hypocritical. Uproar has become standard practice for the fraud panel, officially called the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. Critics say the commission is a pretext for Republican efforts to make it harder to register and to vote, and that it will reach a predetermined conclusion, that tough new rules are needed to prevent fraud. Studies have repeatedly shown that illegal voting is very rare, and that voter impersonation — perhaps the main danger suggested by advocates of tighter election rules — is next to nonexistent. Since its formation, the commission has been accused of skirting open-government laws; it has publicly released personal details like street and e-mail addresses of citizens who contacted it, almost always to complain; and generated a fierce backlash when it asked state election officials to turn over data on every voter in the United States. The advocacy group Common Cause states in a new report that the request led more than 5,000 Colorado voters to de-register so that their personal information would not be sent to Washington. In an interview, Mr. Gardner said the serial controversies had unfairly sullied the commission’s public image almost before it had begun work, adding that he had been branded by some as a vote suppressor merely by serving on it. “You don’t judge a book by its cover,” he said. “You judge at the end.” The Tuesday meeting will be devoted to studying declining public confidence in elections, one of the mandates given the panel by Mr. Trump, who has claimed without foundation that millions of fraudulent ballots enabled Hillary Clinton to win the popular vote in November. Mr. Gardner said he did not necessarily favor imposing new qualifications for registering and voting, but he added that when burdens like poll taxes and literacy tests were imposed on citizens and registering often required a trip to the local courthouse, voter turnout was far higher than it is now. The meeting will include a statistical review of decades of elections and a discussion of whether fraud has reduced citizens’ trust in the fairness of elections — a timely topic, as an allegation of fraud in New Hampshire by one of the commission’s leading members have dominated the runup to the session. The charge was leveled on Thursday by Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state in Kansas, the commission’s vice chairman and, most recently, columnist for the far-right website Breitbart News. In his debut column, Mr. Kobach said Ms. Hassan’s victory in the contest for a New Hampshire seat in the Senate — and perhaps Mrs. Clinton’s narrow win in the state — likely were the result of voter fraud. His accusation was based on data from Mr. Gardner’s office showing that 6,540 people in New Hampshire registered to vote on Election Day using out-of-state driver’s licenses to verify their identities, but only 1,014 of the registrants later obtained a New Hampshire license. Mr. Kobach said that was evidence that the remaining 5,313 registrants were illegal voters from other states — enough voters, he noted, to supply the narrow margins of victory for both Ms. Hassen and Mrs. Clinton. “If the presidential election had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences,” he wrote. “Regardless, in the Senate, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result.” Voting-rights advocates were contemptuous. In an online article titled “Kobach Discovers College Students Live in College Towns,” the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University said the bulk of the registrations very likely were filed by out-of-state college students who chose to vote in New Hampshire instead of their home states, as the law allows. Excluding community colleges, New Hampshire is home to more than 34,000 college and university students. According to New Hampshire Public Radio, the places where registrants most frequently displayed out-of-state licenses were all college towns. “It’s not the first time that Kris Kobach has mischaracterized evidence to legitimize an otherwise fraudulent claim of voter fraud,” Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said. “But he’s now in a position where the consequences of doing this are really serious.” Mr. Kobach’s allegation sparked an immediate demand by the state’s four legislators in Congress that Mr. Gardner resign from the commission. In a broadcast interview on Thursday, Mr. Gardner called that hypocritical, asking whether any of the legislators had ever quit a congressional committee because they disagreed with the views of another member. “There is no proof that there is any voter fraud,” he said on Friday, but “people have a right to their opinions.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Trump’s Worst: An Update,"Gail Collins Donald Trump has just voted in the Worst Cabinet Member contest. “We’ll see,” he said when asked by reporters if he was going to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. I believe I speak for us all when I say this does not sound like a vote of confidence. Price recently became famous as the guy who enjoys traveling by private charter plane at the taxpayers’ expense. You would think that Trump, who loves his private planes like a family member, would be a little sympathetic to someone’s distaste for commercial travel. But no. “I am not happy about it. I’m going to look at it. I am not happy about it, and I let him know it,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. Now Price is also the guy who is waging a war against birth control that’s cratering teen pregnancy prevention programs. But in this administration you can ruin federal initiatives aimed at avoiding unwanted pregnancy and Donald Trump — no fan of unwanted pregnancy — will completely ignore it. If Price goes down, it will be over his travel bills, which is sort of like Al Capone going to jail for tax evasion. Price claimed that a majority of the private charters he’d taken “were for the opioid crisis or the hurricanes.” No indication of whether it was a weather disaster or drug emergency that took him to the Aspen Ideas Festival in June. Still not quite as bad as attempting to cut $6 billion from next year’s National Institutes of Health research. But I say, go with what you can get. Tom Price is terrible and whatever sends him out of government is fine. Do you think he’s the Worst Cabinet Member? There’s so much competition. Consider Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who attempted to get rebellious House members to support Trump’s budget deal with the Democrats by asking them to do it “for me.” Apparently Mnuchin had no idea that Republican lawmakers’ affection for him was about on par with their feelings for special work sessions over holiday weekends. Policy-wise, Mnuchin is an awful Treasury secretary, unless you’d been hoping the post would go to someone whose strong point is a keen understanding of all the hopes and needs of the hedge fund industry. Plus, there’s a plane thing! At one point Mnuchin tried to get a government jet to take him on his honeymoon. More recently, he used one to fly him and his wife to Fort Knox. Mnuchin argued that Fort Knox was an important stop for a Treasury secretary because, you know, there’s all that gold. When cynics speculated that the couple just wanted to be somewhere where they could get a good view of the eclipse, Mnuchin told Politico, winningly, that was silly: “You know, people in Kentucky took this stuff very serious. Being a New Yorker … I was like, the eclipse? Really? I don’t have any interest in watching the eclipse.” It’s true. We New Yorkers do not care a bit about planetary phenomenon. We are only interested in jaywalking and hedge funds. The Trump cabinet is worth trashing on so many important levels that it does seem unfair to judge the members simply on the basis of stupid moves of self-gratification. You would like to see the country denouncing Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, for having stripped his agency of scientists. (“Science is not something that should be just thrown about to try to dictate policy in Washington D.C.”) However, that seems to be working well for Pruitt in Trump Washington. So as a fallback, let’s encourage discussion of the $25,000 he’s spending to put a soundproof phone booth in his office. Is there anybody in this cabinet who you can like? A Morning Consult/Politico poll of registered voters found Defense Secretary James Mattis had the most support — although to be honest, none of Trump’s appointees exactly elicited enthusiasm. Mattis is frequently mentioned as a man standing between our president and Armageddon, so you could understand him being popular even if he got caught flying in the wrong plane. The Trump administration has clearly gotten American people very interested in the presidential cabinet. For instance, 24 percent of the respondents in that poll said they liked Sonny Perdue, and the idea that many people even know Perdue is secretary of agriculture is sort of a wow. Although of course it’s possible that some of them thought he had something to do with chicken. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was at the bottom, presumably because a whole lot of people believe that she is trying to reorganize public education into a private venture. DeVos — who also came in last in a readers poll I did a few months back — has been a particular foe of government attempts to crack down on for-profit colleges that cheat their students. Recently, she picked a former official in a for-profit college to lead a department anti-fraud unit. And on this one, we know that it’s the policies people don’t like. DeVos is so godawful rich, she rides in private planes she pays for herself.",The New York Times
2017,Try These ‘Love Hacks’ to Fix Your Marriage,"After studying thousands of couples, the psychologist Eli Finkel has an explanation for the decline in people’s satisfaction with their marriages over the past four decades: It’s a matter of emotional supply and demand. Many people are looking to their partners to replace the companionship and emotional support once provided by extended families and local institutions like churches, bowling leagues, bridge groups, fraternal lodges and garden clubs. Meanwhile, though, many couples are so busy with their jobs and parenting that they’re actually spending less time together by themselves. What to do? Unless you’re willing to reduce your demands, the only solution is to increase the supply. You can devote a lot more effort to satisfying your partner, and Dr. Finkel tells you how to do that in his new book, “The All-or-Nothing Marriage.” But if that sounds like too much work, he also offers a few shortcuts that he calls “love hacks.” If your schedule doesn’t allow a weekly date night, if you don’t want to take long walks on the beach or go on joint self-actualization vacations, you can use some quick fixes that have been tested successfully in Dr. Finkel’s relationships laboratory at Northwestern and elsewhere. A love hack, as Dr. Finkel defines it, is a proven technique that takes little time or effort and doesn’t even require cooperation from your partner. “It’s a quick-and-dirty option that can take just a few minutes a month,” he says. “It’s not going to give you a great marriage, but it can certainly improve things. After all, simply allowing the relationship to slip off the priority list will probably yield stagnation, or worse.” He offers a variety of love hacks because he doesn’t believe in one-size-fits-all solutions for relationships. He suggests picking whichever hack appeals and starting right away. Holding hands can win you points even when you don’t mean it, as demonstrated in an experiment with couples who watched a video together. Some people were instructed not to touch their partners during the video, while others were told to touch in a “warm, comfortable and positive way.” Afterward, the people who had been touched reported being more confident of being loved by their partner — and this effect occurred even when the people knew that their partners’ actions were being directed by the researchers. Their rational selves knew that the hand-holding wasn’t a spontaneous gesture of affection, but it made them feel better anyway. If your partner does something wrong, like not returning a phone call, don’t over-interpret it. Researchers have found that one of the biggest differences between happy and unhappy couples is their “attributional style” in explaining a partner’s offense. The unhappy couples tend to automatically attribute something like an unreturned phone call to a permanent inner flaw in the partner (“He’s too selfish to care about me”) rather than a temporary external situation, like an unusually busy day at work. When something goes wrong, before drawing any conclusions about your partner, take a few seconds to consider an alternative explanation that puts the blame elsewhere. In an experiment with 120 married couples in Chicago, Dr. Finkel periodically asked questions about their marriages over the course of two years. During the first year, their satisfaction with their marriages declined, which unfortunately is typical. At the start of the second year, some of the couples were instructed to try something new when they found themselves in an argument: “Think about this disagreement with your partner from the perspective of a neutral third party who wants the best for all involved; a person who see things from a neutral point of view. How might this person think about the disagreement? How might he or she find the good that could come from it?” Again, that little exercise made a big difference. Over the next year, marital satisfaction remained stable in those couples, whereas it continued to decline in the control group that hadn’t been instructed to take the third-party perspective. Once a week, write down a few things your partner has done to “invest in the relationship,” as the participants in one experiment were instructed to do. Other participants were instructed to list things they had done themselves to invest in the relationship. The ones who patted themselves on the back subsequently felt a little more committed to the relationship, but the ones who wrote about their partners’ contributions felt significantly more committed — and also, not surprisingly, a lot more grateful toward their partners. One of the most common factors in failed marriages is the “rejection sensitivity” of one partner. People with low self-esteem have a hard time believing their partner really loves them, so they often preemptively discount their partner’s affection in order to avoid being hurt by the expected rejection. Eventually, even when they start off with a loving partner, their worst fear comes true because their defensive behavior ends up driving the other person away. In testing ways to counteract this anxiety, researchers asked insecure people to recall a specific compliment from their partner. Giving a detailed account of the situation and the compliment didn’t have any effect, apparently because these insecure people could dismiss it as a lucky aberration: “For once I did something right.” But there was a notable effect when people were asked to think about the compliment abstractly: “Explain why your partner admired you. Describe what it meant to you and its significance for your relationship.” That quick exercise helped them see why their partner could really care for them. When your partner tells you about something that went right in his or her day, get excited about it. Ask questions so your partner can tell you more about the event and relive it. Put some enthusiasm into your voice and your reactions. Researchers call this a “capitalization attempt.” When researchers studied couples who were trained to use these techniques in their evening discussions, it turned out that each partner took more pleasure from their own victories, and both partners ended up feeling closer to each other. By sharing the joy, everyone came out ahead — and in true love-hack fashion, it didn’t take much time at all. OpinionEli J. Finkel OpinionEli J. Finkel OpinionDavid Brooks",The New York Times
2017,"Trying to Stem Fallout From Breach, Equifax Replaces C.E.O.","When the board of Equifax convened last week to discuss the company’s response to an enormous data breach, the 10 outside directors concluded that it was time for their hard-driving chief executive to step down. There was a problem, though. The roster of possible replacements had been depleted by the fallout from the cyberattack, which had compromised the personal information of much of the adult population of the United States. Some top contenders were considered tainted, according to two people briefed on the board’s deliberations. Three of the company’s senior executives, including the head of its largest division and the chief financial officer, are under scrutiny for selling stock after the breach was discovered but before it had been disclosed to the public. Equifax spent five more days limping through the crisis before announcing on Tuesday that the chief executive, Richard F. Smith, would retire. The shake-up is the culmination of weeks of mounting public and legal pressure on the Atlanta-based data clearinghouse from citizens, politicians and investors. The company’s lackluster response to the breach has prompted consumer outrage, while lawmakers have begun pushing for tougher oversight of the industry. Although Mr. Smith retired, the board took an unusual step that reflected the damage from the breach. The board said it could retroactively classify Mr. Smith as having been fired for cause. If that were to happen, Mr. Smith would probably be required to forgo or repay certain compensation. Mr. Smith will be replaced on an interim basis by the company’s head of its Asia-Pacific region, Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. One of Equifax’s outside board members, Mark Feidler, will succeed Mr. Smith as nonexecutive chairman. The company is now conducting a search for a permanent chief executive that includes internal and external candidates. “Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize,” said Mr. Feidler, an Atlanta-based private equity executive. But management changes alone are unlikely to quell the complaints of critics. Multiple congressional committees are planning hearings into the breach and Equifax’s response to it. More than 30 state law-enforcement authorities have opened inquiries, as has the F.B.I. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Tuesday that it is “not real accountability if the guy promoted to chairman is an Equifax board member who served on the committee that was responsible for overseeing data security.” The Equifax breach, which exposed the personal information of up to 143 million Americans, has cast a harsh spotlight on the company’s governance. Its board of directors largely consists of low-profile retired corporate executives. Half of the 10 outside board members are past or present fixtures of the Atlanta business community. Mr. Smith, 57, took over as chief executive in 2005, after a 22-year career at General Electric in which he worked in the conglomerate’s asset-management, insurance and leasing divisions. At Equifax, he presided over a period of rapidly growing sales, driven by expanding troves of sensitive personal data. Profits rose, and the stock price followed. When the crisis hit, the company stumbled. Its website repeatedly crashed as millions of desperate individuals tried to find out whether their information was part of the breach. People who were potentially affected were unable to sign up for protection the company was offering or, even if they had been successful, could not get the service activated. Equifax also charged many people to freeze their credit files before reversing course in the wake of fierce criticism. In an early bid to contain the crisis, Equifax said on Sept. 14 that two top executives, its chief information officer and chief security officer, were stepping down. But the storm was intensifying — and the board decided it needed to take more drastic action. Before the attack, the company would most likely have turned to its top executive ranks. One obvious candidate, Joseph M. Loughran III, runs Equifax’s core credit reporting division and previously served as its chief marketing officer. By the time Equifax’s board meeting began last Wednesday evening, it was clear that Mr. Loughran and others were no longer in the running. Three executives, including Mr. Loughran, had sold $1.8 million worth of shares in the days after the hack was discovered. The company says the executives who sold shares had not been aware of the breach at the time of the sales. With a limited pool of candidates, the board turned to Mr. Barros, who joined Equifax in 2010 and was most recently based in Sydney, Australia. Before that, he had a long career working at telecommunications companies including BellSouth and AT&T. “He is an experienced leader with deep knowledge of our company and the industry,” said Ines Gutzmer, an Equifax spokeswoman. “The board of directors has absolute confidence in his ability to guide the company through this transition.” Mr. Feidler, the new chairman, comes from a similar background as Mr. Barros. A longtime telecom executive and banker, Mr. Feidler was president and chief operating officer at BellSouth until its 2006 merger with AT&T. The following year, he co-founded the Atlanta private-equity firm MSouth Equity Partners. Equifax’s board has created a special committee to review the data breach. As part of his departure agreement, Mr. Smith agreed that Equifax can decide at a later date on the specific terms of his departure, based on the findings of the special committee. “Mr. Smith has been very cooperative and supportive of this approach,” said Wyatt Jefferies, an Equifax spokesman. Mr. Smith will retain about $18.4 million in pension benefits, according to a regulatory filing. He also holds around $20.8 million in stock awards, according to Equilar, which tracks executive compensation. Those shares would be forfeited if his termination is decided to have been for cause. Mr. Smith owns Equifax shares worth $23.6 million. He received bonuses of roughly $3 million in 2015 and 2016, but agreed to waive any bonus for this year after the hack. Mr. Smith had been scheduled to appear at two congressional hearings next week, but his departure raised questions about whether he could choose not to testify. “A C.E.O. walking out the door just days before he is to appear before Congress is an abdication of his responsibility,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. Mr. Jefferies, the Equifax spokesman, indicated that Mr. Smith would still cooperate. “If Congress asks him, he will go,” Mr. Jefferies said. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the Equifax board chairman. He is Mark Feidler, not Feilder.",The New York Times

2017,Tumult After AIDS Fund-Raiser Supports Harvey Weinstein Production,"In May 2015, the entertainment producer Harvey Weinstein arranged for two items to be auctioned off at a fund-raiser for amfAR, a New York-based charity that works to cure AIDS. The offers — a sitting with a famous fashion photographer and a package of tickets to a Hollywood film awards event and parties — came with a condition: $600,000 of the money raised at the auction, in Cannes, France, would go to the American Repertory Theater, a nonprofit playhouse that had done a trial run of “Finding Neverland,” a Broadway musical that Mr. Weinstein produced. The theater had agreed to reimburse Mr. Weinstein and other investors for a $1.25 million payment and $500,000 charitable contribution toward the show if they could get third parties to donate those amounts, according to records of the arrangement. Now, amfAR’s board of directors is embroiled in conflict. Some members are questioning the deal involving the auction proceeds, saying that the details were not disclosed and that the organization was not protected. The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, is investigating corporate governance at the charity. “Our charities bureau is working with amfAR in connection with a dispute among board members, with the goal of achieving a resolution as expeditiously as possible,” Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, said in a statement. Mr. Weinstein, who is a longtime supporter of the AIDS organization and was a chairman of the 2015 event, said that he had done nothing wrong and that everyone benefited from the arrangement, which raised $309,669 for amfAR. “I honestly thought we were doing something fantastic for both sides,” he said in an interview. “We get money, they get money, and it’s all our money.” Gibson, Dunn & Cutcher, a law firm hired by the amfAR board, reviewed the $600,000 transaction and determined that it was legitimate and lawful. But a lawyer who first investigated the way the arrangement was handled concluded that it put the charity’s financial integrity at risk, according to several people who reviewed his confidential report, which was commissioned by amfAR. And in a June 2015 email to the charity’s chief financial officer, its chief executive, Kevin Frost, expressed concern: “Nothing about this deal feels right to me, and I believe we have not done due diligence to understand exactly what this money is being directed to or why amfAR is being used to facilitate these transfers.” In April of this year, four members of the 19-person board complained to the attorney general’s office. They said that Kenneth Cole, the fashion designer and board chairman, had signed off on the $600,000 transfer “despite the clear objections of the executive management team,” said their spokesman, Steven Goldberg. They say board members were never informed that the auction proceeds would help cover the “Finding Neverland” investors’ costs. Mr. Cole said that he welcomed an arrangement that would bring in money for the AIDS cause and that executive staff had signed off on it. He said that he did not recall Mr. Weinstein telling him it would serve a business deal with the American Repertory Theatre, but that he was satisfied knowing the $600,000 was going to a credible nonprofit. “This wasn’t just a man on the street asking — it was someone who has raised a lot of money for us,” Mr. Cole said in an interview. “One tends to address requests based on whom they’re coming from.” It is not uncommon for commercial shows, before they hit Broadway, to go through an incubation period at a nonprofit theater, with infusions of financial support from investors. Under so-called enhancement agreements, the theaters are able to mount larger productions than their budgets normally allow, while producers and investors get feedback and a chance to polish their shows before going to New York. What was unusual about the agreement that Mr. Weinstein’s theatrical production company, Weinstein Live Entertainment, struck in 2014 with the repertory theater — located in Cambridge, Mass., and affiliated with Harvard University — is that the show’s 24 investors would be reimbursed if they brought in third-party charitable contributions. In the end, $1.95 million in contributions were made to the theater as “contemplated by the agreement,” according to a July 2015 email from a lawyer for the theater to Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer. In addition to the money that came from the amfAR auction, Mr. Weinstein helped arrange for a $200,000 donation from a family foundation that fights poverty in South Africa, a $600,000 donation from the Louis Vuitton fashion house and hundreds of thousands of dollars more from online charitable auctions. Lloyd Mayer, a professor of nonprofit law at the University of Notre Dame, said the agreement appeared to allow charitable contributions to serve the private benefit of Mr. Weinstein and the other commercial investors. Jason Lilien, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, said it did not matter if the other “Finding Neverland” investors “incidentally benefited” from the charitable contributions because the primary purpose was to put on a production for the public’s benefit. The theater declined to comment. Mr. Lilien said Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Cole that the money raised through the auction would serve a “Finding Neverland” business agreement. Orin Snyder, a lawyer with Gibson, Dunn & Cutcher, said in a statement that “during our inquiry, Harvey Weinstein disclosed and we confirmed that the contribution was part of his company’s ‘Finding Neverland’ agreement with A.R.T.,” referring to the theater. The auction catalog for the amfAR fund-raising gala disclosed that some of the money raised from the sitting with the fashion photographer would go to the theater, but did not note that for the Hollywood experience package arranged by Mr. Weinstein. Tom Ajamie, the first lawyer hired by the charity to review the $600,000 transaction, concluded that failure to disclose was “fraud on the bidders” by amfAR, according to people who reviewed the report. Mr. Weinstein’s attorneys said it was a clerical mistake by amfAR. Mr. Weinstein said that when arranging the charitable contributions that flowed to the theater he told some donors that the funds were to support the “Finding Neverland” production. But, he said, it wasn’t his responsibility to further disclose that the money would be used to reimburse him and the other investors or otherwise cover their business obligations. If people wanted to learn more, he said, they could have done internet research. “Today, if you want to know something, it’s easy,” he said. “Google ‘A.R.T.,’ whatever. You don’t want to make a donation to that, don’t. Whatever. These people aren’t forced to write a check to A.R.T. They can Google it, they can call it, they can speak to it, people will answer them.” After Gibson, Dunn & Cutcher concluded its investigation, Mr. Weinstein asked amfAR board members and executive staff to sign pledges that there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that they would not probe further. In exchange, he said that he “will not at any time in the future engage in wrongful conduct involving amfAR.” Explaining why he had sought the non-disclosures, Mr. Weinstein expressed annoyance, saying that he had been dragged into an internal power struggle on amfAR’s board. Four members — Vincent Roberti, Mervyn Silverman, Arlen Andelson and Jonathan Canno — refused to sign the document. The next month, they went to the attorney general. Since then, two other board members have resigned over the handling of the transaction, according to several people familiar with the resignations. Mr. Weinstein has helped raise millions of dollars for amfAR over the years at its annual benefit at Cannes, which draws celebrities and is one of the most glamorous charitable events in the world. In 2016, he also helped arrange a fund-raiser for the organization in New York. This year, he pledged a $1 million in donations to the charity. Mr. Weinstein said he paid $600,000 of that commitment this year to try to smooth over the conflict. “I went to them. I said, ‘I’m paying you $600,000 — shut up, you’re hurting the goddamn charity,’” he said.",The New York Times
2017,"Turkey Signs Russian Missile Deal, Pivoting From NATO","ISTANBUL — In the clearest sign of his pivot toward Russia and away from NATO and the West, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Tuesday that Turkey had signed a deal to purchase a Russian surface-to-air missile system. The deal cements a recent rapprochement with Russia, despite differences over the war in Syria, and comes as Turkey’s ties with the United States and European Union have become strained. It is certain to stir unease in Washington and Brussels, where officials are trying to keep Turkey — a longtime NATO member, and an increasingly unlikely candidate for European Union membership — from entering Russia’s sphere of influence. The deal comes as relations between Russia and the West are at a particularly low point. Tensions escalated in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and then began fomenting armed revolt in eastern Ukraine. They have grown still worse as evidence has mounted that Moscow was behind the hacking of the 2016 election in the United States and also tried to interfere in other nations’ elections. Although a prospective missile purchase from Russia was made public several months ago, Mr. Erdogan’s announcement was the first confirmation that Turkey had transferred money to pay for the missile system, known as the S-400. “Signatures have been made for the purchase of S-400s from Russia,” Mr. Erdogan said in comments published in several newspapers on Tuesday. “A deposit has also been paid as far as I know.” The purchase of the missile system flies in the face of cooperation within the NATO alliance, which Turkey has belonged to since the early 1950s. NATO does not ban purchases of military hardware from manufacturers outside the American-led alliance, but it does discourage members from buying equipment not compatible with that used by other members. A NATO official in Brussels, the headquarters of the alliance, said that no NATO member currently operates the Russian missile system and that the alliance had not been informed about the details of the purchase by Turkey. “What matters for NATO is that the equipment allies acquire is able to operate together,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as required by alliance procedures. “Interoperability of allied armed forces is essential to NATO for the conduct of our operations.” Turkey had earlier planned to buy missiles from China, but that deal fell through under pressure from the United States. Western arms makers lobbied hard for the expansion of NATO into former Soviet satellite countries after the collapse of Communism. They have since lobbied both new and old NATO member states not to stray outside the alliance for weapons purchases that would cut into their business. Mr. Erdogan dismissed issues of interoperability, brand loyalties or the geopolitical optics of such a sale. “Nobody has the right to discuss the Turkish republic’s independence principles or independent decisions about its defense industry,” the daily newspaper Hurriyet reported him as saying. “We make the decisions about our own independence ourselves,” he said. “We are obliged to take safety and security measures in order to defend our country.” Mr. Erdogan’s announcement — made to Turkish journalists aboard his presidential jet as he returned from Kazakhstan — appeared timed as a riposte to two judicial cases announced last week in the United States. One is against his presidential bodyguards, who are charged with assaulting protesters when Mr. Erdogan visited Washington this year. The other is against a group of Turks, including a former minister, accused of breaking United States sanctions against Iran. Mr. Erdogan has angrily criticized both cases. Yet Turkey has other reasons for the missile purchase. It needs to cultivate good relations with Russia, and it also needs to build its own military defense, said Asli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Turkey wants the deal,” she said, “and Russia is only too happy to drive a wedge into the NATO alliance.” NATO’s collective defense should be sufficient for Turkey; indeed, NATO deployed Patriot missiles there during a rise of tensions with Syria in the past. But Mr. Erdogan has lost trust in the West since last year’s failed coup, which he has interpreted as a Western plot to oust him, and appears determined to secure his own defense, Ms. Aydintasbas said. Military and civilian plotters used jets and tanks to try to seize power last July and bombed several locations, including the Parliament building, before being faced down by loyalist security forces and public demonstrations. Mr. Erdogan narrowly evaded capture. The transfer of technology from Russia is attractive to Turkey, Ms. Aydintasbas said. Mr. Erdogan has spoken also of his frustration at having requests to the United States for drones turned down, and of his satisfaction that Turkey developed its own. Mr. Erdogan’s announcement of the deal with Russia came after Germany said that it was suspending all major arms exports to Turkey because of the deteriorating human rights situation in the country and the increasingly strained ties. “We have put on hold all big requests that Turkey sent to us, and these are really not a few,” the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said during a panel discussion in Berlin on Monday, according to Reuters. As suspicions toward the West have grown, relations with Russia have warmed, driven by the personal relationship between Mr. Erdogan and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Erdogan has expressed personal admiration for Mr. Putin, to the consternation of many European and American leaders, if not President Trump. Mr. Erdogan has also shown a preference for the Russian model, with its sense of restoring a lost empire, returning Turkey to a more independent place in the world and rejecting Western democracy. After a tense falling out in 2015, when Turkish jets shot down a Russian warplane on Turkey’s border with Syria, Mr. Erdogan sought to improve relations with Russia, sending two letters to Mr. Putin and then traveling to Moscow for a meeting in June 2016. His visit represented a marked shift from the Cold War era, when Turkey was a staunch ally of the West in facing down the Soviet Union. (Turkey shares a border with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, former Soviet republics that remain, to varying degrees, under Russian influence.) Russian-Turkish rivalry in the Black Sea and the Caucasus dates back centuries. Mr. Putin, at odds with the West since he annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, also worked hard to patch up relations with Ankara, seeing in Mr. Erdogan a like-minded strongman who shares his distrust of meddling by the West. The fact that Turkey belongs to NATO, whose unity Moscow has struggled for years to undermine, has only increased Mr. Putin’s desire to forge strong relations with Mr. Erdogan despite their differences over the conflict in Syria. “Mr. Putin and myself are determined on this issue,” Mr. Erdogan told journalists about the missile deal. Last year, Russia and Turkey reached an agreement to revive a suspended natural-gas pipeline project. The purchase of Russian missiles would take cooperation to a new level, but is not the first time that Turkey has bought military equipment from Russia. It turned to Moscow in the early 1990s to buy military helicopters and armored personnel carriers. After relations hit a rocky patch over Russia’s 1994 war in Chechnya, however, Turkey disappointed hopes in Moscow that it would become a major new market for Russian hardware. Russia, largely squeezed out of the arms market in Western and Eastern Europe, even in countries that once bought nearly all their weapons from the Soviet Union, has looked for years to NATO’S eastern flank as a promising market and the alliance’s weakest link. It has also sold weapons to Greece, another NATO member and to Cyprus, which is not a member of NATO but houses British military bases and effectively serves as an outpost of the alliance.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Turkey’s Future Is Moving Backward,"World Review Anyone who has visited the city center in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, would have noticed a bronze sculpture of a young woman reading a book. Designed by the Turkish artist Metin Yurdanur, the sculpture is known as the Human Rights Monument, and the woman is reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I was a college student when the statue was erected in 1990. We would sit around it for hours, drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and listening to the sound of rock music mingling with the clack of backgammon pieces from the bars and teahouses nearby. The scene was a mixture of opposite worlds: East and West, traditions and modernity, religion and secularism. It might have seemed confusing to outsiders, but we Turks generally didn’t mind. To be Turkish meant to be confused about identity issues anyhow. Over the years the monument earned a political reputation. Every time the government stepped up its repression of Turkey’s Kurdish-majority areas and denied the Kurds equal rights, including the right to education in their mother tongue, Kurdish activists would rally at the Human Rights Monument to issue press statements. Others followed suit: secularists, Turkish religious sects, women’s rights groups, sexual minorities — any people who believed that their voices were being silenced by the regime. During the past year, the Human Rights Monument has been busier than ever. Following the coup attempt in July 2016, which left more than 200 people dead and traumatized the entire nation, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared a state of emergency in Turkey. For a few days, a national consensus condemned the coup. The left and right united. But the harmony didn’t last long. The president’s Justice and Development party, known as the A.K.P., initiated a vast purge. Since last summer, some 150,000 people have been expelled from their jobs, and 50,000 have been arrested. The crackdown has been especially harsh for journalists, writers and intellectuals. More than 150 media outlets were shut down, Wikipedia was banned and over 150 journalists were imprisoned, with an even larger number blacklisted. Academics whose only “crime” was to sign a peace petition have been fired, detained, stigmatized. Once demonized publicly, these people cannot find another job in a Turkish university. Two of them, Mehmet Fatih Tras and Mustafa Sadik Akdag, have committed suicide. Under the rule of law everyone is considered innocent until proven guilty. In Turkey, it’s now the opposite. People from all across the ideological spectrum have been baselessly charged with crimes and expected to prove their innocence. Such is the case of the iconic opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet, whose editors have been accused of being conspirators in the coup — a charge that no one took seriously. Seven staff members have been released from prison, but four others, including the distinguished journalists Ahmet Sik and Kadri Gursel, are still being held. Among the hundreds of people who have organized protests and sit-ins around the Human Rights Monument, one case has attracted nationwide attention. When Nuriye Gulmen, a literature professor, and Semih Ozakca, who taught primary school, were unlawfully expelled from their jobs, they went on a hunger strike, surviving only on a liquid diet of saltwater and sugar solutions. Support for them grew nationally and internationally. In May, the police dispersed the sit-in, detained supporters and barricaded the area. Ms. Gulmen and Mr. Ozakca were put in jail. When a new campaign sprang up to urge citizens to support the hunger strikers by singing songs and anthems, the Ankara governor’s office banned those activities on the streets after dark. Turkey’s political trajectory shows the world the fragility of democracy. It is a delicate ecosystem of checks and balances that needs a free media and a conscious civil society to survive. The A.K.P. elite under President Erdogan wrongfully assume that having the majority in the ballot box gives them the legitimacy and the power to do whatever they please. It doesn’t. The vote is just one of the components for a democracy to function properly. Democracy also requires separation of powers, rule of law, a free press and academic freedom, among other things. All of these components have been broken in Turkey. As nationalism, Islamism and authoritarianism have increased in Turkey, so has sexism. Turkey ranks 130th out of 144 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report issued by the World Economic Forum. And sexual harassment is rife. Recently the A.K.P. tried to pass a law that would make it possible for rapists to avoid punishment if they married their victims. After protests, the bill was withdrawn. The feeling among Turkey’s progressives is that our lifestyle is under siege and secularism is being systematically chipped away. Around one million students have been enrolled in imam-hatip schools — vocational schools designed to train imams and provide a thoroughly religious education — up from 63,000 in 2002. Turkey is becoming more religious, more paranoid and more inward-looking. We have become a nation where teachers can be detained for no reason, singing songs can be banned and intellectuals and writers can be accused of sending subliminal messages to society. Nobody feels secure or knows how things can get better, or if they ever will. The demise of Turkey’s shaky democracy shows us that history doesn’t necessarily move forward. Sometimes it goes backward. OpinionElmira Bayrasli",The New York Times
2017,Turkey’s President Assails U.S. Over Indictment of Ex-Minister,"ANKARA, Turkey — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on Friday criticized the United States over the indictment of a former Turkish economy minister who was accused of helping Iran evade United States sanctions, depicting the charges as a political move against his country. Speaking to reporters before departing for a visit to Kazakhstan, Mr. Erdogan also criticized a separate indictment against Turkish security officials accused of attacking demonstrators during his visit to Washington in the spring. He said the handling of the episode demonstrated the “weakness” of the United States government. “I assess the step taken against our former economy minister as a step against the Turkish Republic,” Mr. Erdogan said. This week’s indictment of the former minister, Zafer Caglayan, has heightened already tense relations between Turkey and the United States. The case is part of a widening American investigation over Iran’s efforts to evade sanctions and involves a Turkish-Iranian gold trader and Turkish officials. Turkey is angered by American support for a Syrian Kurdish militia, which it considers to be a terrorist organization, and complains of a lack of support from the United States, a NATO ally, after a coup attempt last year. In addition, a Senate committee on Thursday voted to block the United States government from supporting weapons sales to security forces protecting Mr. Erdogan after the episode in which his bodyguards used violence against protesters during his Washington visit. Mr. Erdogan called on American authorities to “review” the decision to indict Mr. Caglayan, saying the former minister had not engaged in any wrongdoing because Turkey had not imposed sanctions on Iran, an important trade partner. He said he would take up the issue with American officials when he attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month. Mr. Caglayan remains in Turkey. On the indictment of his security personnel, Mr. Erdogan again accused American security officials of not taking any steps to protect him from the demonstrators, who he said were members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, also known as the P.K.K. He said two female security officials who were protecting the Turkish first lady and were not present at the incident were also indicted. “This demonstrates the weakness that the U.S. has fallen into,” Mr. Erdogan said. “You might be a great nation but to be a just state is something else.”",The New York Times
2017,Turkey’s President Calls U.S. Indictments of His Guards a ‘Scandal’,"Turkey’s president denounced what he called the “scandalous” American judicial system on Friday, responding to new indictments of his bodyguards over a brawl during his visit to Washington in May. The remarks in Istanbul by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, underscored his view of the indictments as another affront in an increasingly strained relationship with the United States, a NATO ally. Members of Mr. Erdogan’s armed security detail were captured on video punching, kicking and choking pro-Kurdish protesters, including American citizens, outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence in Washington on May 16. Video clips also showed that Mr. Erdogan, who was in Washington to meet with President Trump, witnessed the brawl. Washington police officers intervened to halt the fighting, which the Metropolitan Police chief, Peter Newsham, described as a brutal attack on peaceful protesters that had left at least 11 people injured. American lawmakers and other officials expressed outrage that Mr. Erdogan’s guards had behaved in such a manner. Twelve Turkish security officers were charged in June in connection with the attack. A federal grand jury indicted three more this past Tuesday. Four others also have been charged. All but two of the defendants — a pair of Turkish-American businessmen — are at large, and most, if not all, are believed to be in Turkey. Mr. Erdogan’s aides have said his security detail was shielding the Turkish president from what they called inadequate protection by the Washington police from the demonstrators, who were protesting Mr. Erdogan’s crackdown on Kurdish separatists. Mr. Erdogan, who had expressed his anger when the initial indictments were announced three months ago, doubled down on his criticism on Friday when asked about the additional indictments. “This is completely a scandal,” he told reporters in televised remarks on the first day of the Eid al-Adha holiday. “It is clearly a scandalous sign of how justice works in America.” Mr. Erdogan also said he would discuss the issue with President Trump if the opportunity arose. Both are attending the United Nations’ annual General Assembly summit meeting later this month. The criminal charges have added to Mr. Erdogan’s irritation with the United States, which predates Mr. Trump’s presidency. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly called on the American judicial authorities to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. He is the leader of a Turkish Muslim sect accused by Mr. Erdogan of having helped orchestrate an attempted coup that roiled Turkey in July 2016. Mr. Gulen, a longtime critic of Mr. Erdogan’s, has denied any connection to the coup attempt and vowed to fight extradition. Thousands of people suspected of being followers of Mr. Gulen and his sect have been purged from their jobs and prosecuted in Turkey since the coup attempt. Mr. Erdogan’s government refers to Mr. Gulen’s sect as Feto, an acronym for “Fethullah Gulen terrorist organization.” The Turkish leader also has criticized the American military for aiding Syrian Kurdish militia fighters in the fight to rout the Islamic State from Syria. Mr. Erdogan and his aides regard the Syrian Kurds as enemies because of their links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, the main Kurdish militant group in Turkey, also known as the P.K.K. “These developments in the United States are not good at all,” Mr. Erdogan said Friday. “The United States is still a country where the Feto gang is being protected.” He also said the United States “has literally become a country where the P.K.K. terrorist organization is under protection.”",The New York Times
2017,"Twice Beaten, Thrice Shy? Not for Sal Albanese, Mayoral Hopeful. Again.","The candidate sat in a dark suit and yellow monogrammed tie on an R train headed to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to campaign with an old friend. Little gave away that the man was nearly at the end of another quixotic campaign to become mayor of New York, except for a small navy button with his first name: Sal. A young man, in a T-shirt and shorts on the same orange seats, leaned over as the train rumbled under Brooklyn. “I just looked you up on Google,” said the man, Kyle McKenzie, 26, who introduced himself as gay and said he would not be supporting Mayor Bill de Blasio for re-election, despite voting for him four years ago. “You were for gays before it was cool.” Another rider, a student at New York University, extended a piece of paper with his phone number and email. “I just picked up a volunteer,” the candidate said, pocketing the paper as he stepped from the train. “I have won elections,” he added, ruefully. Just not for a while. Sal F. Albanese, a lawyer and former city councilman, is on his third run for City Hall, unbowed by defeat. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in the early 1990s. In 1997, he made his first try for City Hall, assailing the “tale of two cities” created by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; he came in third in the Democratic primary, garnering 21 percent of the vote. (The victor, Ruth Messinger, would lose to Mr. Giuliani in November.) He toyed with a run for mayor in 2001, and went for it 12 years later, in a crowded field from which Mr. de Blasio emerged victorious. Mr. Albanese finished eighth out of nine, receiving 0.9 percent of the vote. Now Mr. Albanese, 68, who has made transit and political reform his signature issues, is looking at his most unencumbered shot yet at City Hall, if only because he is taking on an incumbent mayor when no established Democrat saw fit to do so. Alone on the stage with Mr. de Blasio during last month’s primary debate, Mr. Albanese made his appeal to Democrats as the only viable alternative. But despite his long history in New York politics, familiar largely to older residents of Bay Ridge whom he represented from 1982 to 1997, he remains unknown to most voters. He has little time and even fewer resources to change that before the Sept. 12 primary. The Albanese campaign has no dedicated office or full-time staff apart from a pair of consultants, and little money in the bank after it furiously raised and spent the required $175,000 to qualify for last week’s debate. Resources are so slim, in fact, that Mr. Albanese cannot take out a television commercial to introduce himself, or attack the mayor. Since the debate, some donations have come in, he said, but nothing approaching the $5 million that Mr. de Blasio has in his campaign coffers. Instead, Mr. Albanese has crisscrossed the city holding modest campaign events, recording videos to post on the internet and tapping a network of people whom he met long ago. “I remember him from back when very few people were coming out to the blocks,” said Richard Green, who founded the Crown Heights Youth Collective, a community group, in the 1980s and was showing Mr. Albanese around the neighborhood a day after the debate. A lot of Mr. Albanese’s campaigning is like that, peppered with talk of the past. “Are you Sal?” a kindergarten teacher, Judy Coppola, asked as he walked in Bay Ridge. Mr. Albanese, who worked as a teacher in city schools before running for the Council, stopped to talk. “I always said, ‘What happened to him?’” Ms. Coppola said after he walked on. During his time in the City Council, Mr. Albanese got his law degree and was known as a reformer and political maverick, a liberal from a conservative district who wrested the seat from a Republican and held it for 15 years. He voted against the budgets negotiated by the Council speaker, and was rewarded, he said, with a cubbyhole office for his entire tenure. As a councilman, Mr. Albanese sponsored a living wage bill that survived a veto by Mayor Giuliani and stood up for gay rights at political and some personal risk in 1986. “I had a bodyguard for two days when I voted for gay rights,” recalled Mr. Albanese, who described himself as “culturally Catholic” but not a regular at church. But whereas many of his positions dovetail with those of the mayor, Mr. Albanese is a Democrat of an older style, political observers said. “He exemplifies, in some ways, a part of New York City that no longer exists: the angry, white, blue-collar Catholic,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who overlapped with Mr. Albanese when both were students at York College in Queens. Mr. Albanese recently moved to Richmondtown on Staten Island — a hotbed of Trump support — from his longtime home in Bay Ridge, to care for his 89-year-old mother. He has two daughters, both guidance counselors, and four grandchildren, all under the age of 4. After losing his bid for mayor in 1997, Mr. Albanese worked in finance at Invesco and Mesirow Financial, mostly focused on public pension plans. He became of counsel at a small law firm, Allegaert Berger & Vogel LLP, where he has represented union clients among others since his 2013 mayoral bid. His current campaign is based out of his bare-walled office at the firm. But since announcing his run, Mr. Albanese has yet to hit on a defining campaign theme. Mass transit is compelling to voters beleaguered by train delays, but Albany controls the subway system. He has championed a “pied-à-terre” tax on absentee homeowners who essentially park their money in New York City real estate, a tactic that Mr. de Blasio’s administration explored but ultimately dropped. And he would like to create a campaign finance system, modeled on one in Seattle, that gives voters money to give to candidates, known as “democracy vouchers.” Mr. Albanese is opposed to President Trump — “I find they guy abhorrent; it’s surreal that he’s president” — but he said he would avoid the sort of “personal grudge match” that he said Mr. de Blasio has embraced. He said he would take a similar approach with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, seeking to work with the governor on areas of agreement like congestion pricing to fund the city’s subways. Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have been in an open feud for years. In an interview, Mr. Albanese held up the first Italian-American mayor of Boston, Thomas Menino, as the model of what a mayor should be. “He was in the neighborhoods; all he did was focus on Boston,” Mr. Albanese said, contrasting him with Mr. de Blasio, whom he has faulted for his first-term travel to other states and overseas. It is a line of attack he used in the debate and with voters from Staten Island to Crown Heights. “I’ve never seen de Blasio over here,” a man seated on a bench outside Jackie Robinson Park in Brooklyn told Mr. Albanese. Mr. Albanese said that, if elected, he would visit neighborhoods frequently, a notion that appealed to the man, Tony Shaw, 50, who conceded that he had not heard of Mr. Albanese before. “I’m not that well known,” the candidate said. “I’m going to check you out,” Mr. Shaw responded.",The New York Times
2017,Twirly Legs and All: Spike Jonze Spreads His Dance Wings,"Lakeith Stanfield auditioned for a dance show, and he didn’t even know it. In January, Mr. Stanfield, a star of the hit movie “Get Out” and of the hit television series “Atlanta,” was at the Golden Globes. When “Atlanta” won the prize for best comedy, he celebrated onstage with an impressively continuous hula-style hip swivel, his stance wide, arms sinuous. His happy dance quickly went viral and became a GIF. Months later, when Spike Jonze, the Oscar-winning filmmaker, was looking for a lead performer for a new dance-based project, he came across the clip. This guy, Mr. Jonze recalls thinking, knows how to move. Mr. Stanfield said: “Spike reached out to me, and he asked if I had any dance training. I said, no, not formally, but in front of my mirror, yes.” That was good enough. Alongside the actress Mia Wasikowska, Mr. Stanfield stars in “Changers: A Dance Story,” a new piece Mr. Jonze wrote and directed in collaboration with the choreographer Ryan Heffington and the design label Opening Ceremony. It will have its premiere on Sunday, as Opening Ceremony’s fashion week presentation, and then open to the public for a four-night run at La MaMa, the East Village theater. (Proceeds from ticket sales go to the Hurricane Harvey relief fund.) The fashion and dance worlds have long flirted, and Opening Ceremony has a history of collaborating with Mr. Jonze, a friend, and others in their cool-kid clique. “We have this relationship where we dip in and out of each other’s projects,” said Humberto Leon, one-half of the design team Opening Ceremony. “He comes by our office like every other day.” This is the first time they’ve opened their work to the public, though. “We wanted to be inclusive, not just insidery,” Mr. Leon said. Though Mr. Jonze is known for his dance-heavy music videos (he twice won MTV awards for helping choreograph Fatboy Slim videos, including “Praise You,” in which he danced), “Changers,” which runs about 30 minutes, is his first crack at a longer dance piece. “I can really explore telling a story in a language which is all dance,” he said. “I like trying to do things I’ve never done before, that I don’t know how to do. That’s when it’s exciting, because you don’t know whether it’s going to work or not.” He wrote a script and came armed with movement ideas. On tour recently with the singer Frank Ocean, “I’d be in the hotel by myself during the day,” devising steps, Mr. Jonze said. “I’d videotape myself dancing out phrases and then text them to Ryan.” Mr. Heffington, a Los Angeles choreographer and studio owner with a dedicated following, who is best known for his work on videos with Sia (on YouTube, he’ll teach you to do the “Chandelier” dance), saw himself in a supporting role, helping fulfill Mr. Jonze’s precise vision. “It’s been more specific than I think any other project I’ve had the pleasure to work on,” Mr. Heffington said, “because there is such a specific narrative.” The piece is the story of a couple, Ms. Wasikowska and Mr. Stanfield, and the evolution of their relationship. “We’re fast-forwarding this couple’s life, to bring us to present day,” said Carol Lim, the other half of Opening Ceremony. The set includes two wardrobes, and the dancers change clothes throughout, in front of the audience — their way of modeling Opening Ceremony’s designs. Though there’s no dialogue, “they all have dialogue inside every move and gesture,” from the script, Mr. Jonze said. “You’re on a mission,” he told Mr. Stanfield in rehearsal, as he crossed the stage at La MaMa, tearing his hair. For Ms. Wasikowska (“Alice in Wonderland”), who does have dance training — she was on the ballerina track until she was a teenager — it was a welcome change from regular acting. “This is actually my ideal stage performance,” she said. “I don’t have to speak, I just move.” On Wednesday she was deep in rehearsal at La MaMa, learning her solo from Mr. Heffington: “We chassée, piqué arabesque upstage, we shimmy downstage,” he instructed as they practiced in front of a mirror. A three-step turn, another chassée, a stomp on the left foot that Ms. Wasikowska couldn’t quite get. “Could I do the other foot, please?” she begged, jokingly. Beforehand, Mr. Jonze and Mr. Heffington bounced ideas back and forth, quickly. “Where the piano goes dink-dink-dink, I don’t know what it’s called but those sort of twirly legs, put two of those in there,” Mr. Jonze instructed Mr. Heffington. Mr. Heffington didn’t bristle at the simplified movements he was being asked to make. In traditional dance performances, he said, “there’s such a beautiful skill set, that sometimes you can get whisked away with what that is.” But this is different, “because the language of emotion is so strong and loud, and you see these characters.” “Dance,” he said, “is just like the shell of how they communicate.” The 10 or so tracks that form the score were mostly songs that Mr. Jonze already loved, with some suggestions from Mr. Heffington, said Sam Spiegel, the music director and Mr. Jonze’s brother. Mr. Jonze also pulled inspiration from street performers, and from a Buddhist retreat he went on in Dharamsala, India. “The song ‘Downpipe’ by Mark Knight was being played regularly during their aerobic yoga classes,” Mr. Spiegel said, and made it into the piece. As cross-disciplinary exercises, some say that the Opening Ceremony collaborations reach in the wrong direction, though their intentions seem genuine. “Full of easy laughs and ersatz emotion,” Vanessa Friedman, the fashion critic at the New York Times, wrote in her review of a Fashion Week play that Mr. Jonze wrote with Jonah Hill for Opening Ceremony in 2014. “Totally, really, uncool.” In “Changers,” Mr. Stanfield, tall and lean, was not concerned with looking cool. “It causes me to have to learn and fail, a lot, and that’s what makes it so rewarding,” he said of his first dance show. Learning these movements, he added, “I hope it can influence me to tell more organic stories.” Before, his energy came “from my waist up. Now, I think I can maybe incorporate a little bit more toe action.”",The New York Times
2017,Twitter to Test Doubling Tweet Length to 280 Characters,"SAN FRANCISCO — Twitter’s defining attribute has long been its brevity: 140 characters in a post and no more. That is now set to change. Twitter said on Tuesday that it would test extending the text limit of a post on its service to 280 characters. (In effect, that would double the length of the first two sentences of this paragraph; those sentences, for the record, add up to 140 characters.) Twitter said the goal was to eliminate what it viewed as constraints that kept people from tweeting more frequently. One significant barrier, according to Twitter’s internal research, has been the stringent limit on character count. “When people don’t have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people tweeting,” Twitter said in a blog post. It is a significant moment for the 11-year-old Twitter, which has been trying to figure out how to change the social media service without alienating the people who have embraced its short format. The idea of extending the length of Twitter posts has been contentious internally, batted around among product groups that are trying to find ways to persuade people to use the service more frequently. At 328 million users, Twitter has been criticized for its inability to attract more people. Investors have grown nervous, as that slowing of user growth has affected the company’s revenue. Last year, Twitter tried extending its character count by allowing people to post photos and GIFs without counting them against the overall character limit. It also toyed with longer posts exceeding 140 characters, until criticism from users prompted Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, to proclaim that the limit was here to stay. Twitter is now preparing for a backlash from those who might take issue with a 280-character tweet. “We understand since many of you have been tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters,” the company said. “But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint.” The negative reaction was swift, however. Some on Twitter proclaimed it a “terrible idea.” Still, Twitter pointed to people who post primarily in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, languages with alphabets that allow the expression of more thoughts in fewer characters. Those users tend to bump up against the character limits less often, which Twitter said leads to more frequent messages. As a result, Twitter said, if rules around characters are loosened, English-speaking users — who tend to use more characters in tweets — will also hit character limits less frequently. That may, in turn, lead English-speaking users to post more regularly. The test will begin in small groups around the world. The company has not said whether it will roll the change out to all users in the future. Twitter said the people who will get to test the 280-character tweets will be randomly selected. Whether that may include prominent Twitter users like President Trump is unclear. Mr. Trump has often used Twitter to announce policy decisions, which has sometimes led to heat on the service. This week, there was a renewed call to bar Mr. Trump from using Twitter after Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, said recent inflammatory tweets from Mr. Trump should be considered “a declaration of war.” On Monday, Twitter issued a statement from its policy team saying that it took a number of factors into account when dealing with violations of the company’s user agreement, including the “newsworthiness” of the tweet. In the end, “Tweets get right to the point with the information or thoughts that matter,” the company said of the 280-character tweet test. “That is something we will never change.”",The New York Times
2017,"Twitter, With Accounts Linked to Russia, to Face Congress Over Role in Election","SAN FRANCISCO — After a weekend when Americans took to social media to debate President Trump’s admonishment of N.F.L. players who do not stand for the national anthem, a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the issue with hashtags such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee. As Twitter prepared to brief staff members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Thursday for their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, researchers from a public policy group have been following hundreds of accounts to track the continuing Russian operations to influence social media discourse and foment division in the United States. For three weeks, a harsh spotlight has been trained on Facebook over its disclosure that Russians used fake pages and ads, designed to look like the work of American activists, to spread inflammatory messages during and since the presidential campaign. But there is evidence that Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian influence campaign last year. In addition to Russia-linked Twitter accounts that posed as Americans, the platform was also used for large-scale automated messaging, using “bot” accounts to spread false stories and promote news articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers. Twitter has struggled for years to rein in the fake accounts overrunning its platform. Unlike Facebook, the service does not require its users to provide their real name (or at least a facsimile of one) and allows automated accounts — arguing that they are a useful tool for tasks such as customer service. Beyond those restrictions, there is also an online black market for services that can allow for the creation of large numbers of Twitter bots, which can be controlled by a single person while still being difficult to distinguish from real accounts. Since last month, researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, have been publicly tracking 600 Twitter accounts — human users and suspected bots alike — they have linked to Russian influence operations. Those were the accounts pushing the opposing messages on the N.F.L. and the national anthem. Of 80 news stories promoted last week by those accounts, more than 25 percent “had a primary theme of anti-Americanism,” the researchers found. About 15 percent were critical of Hillary Clinton, falsely accusing her of funding left-wing antifa — short for anti-fascist — protesters, tying her to the lethal terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and discussing her daughter Chelsea’s use of Twitter. Eleven percent focused on wiretapping in the federal investigation into Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, with most of them treated the news as a vindication for President Trump’s earlier wiretapping claims. In the face of such public scrutiny, Twitter has said almost nothing about what it knows about Russia’s use of its platform. But Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he would like to know exactly what the company has done to find covert Russian activity and what it has discovered so far about fake accounts — including their reach and impact. “I think right now the public is aware of only a subset of a subset of Russian activity online,” Mr. Schiff said in an interview. He said Facebook long denied that there had been Russian exploitation of its system, before reversing course on Sept. 6. Mr. Schiff said the tech companies have asked for assistance from American intelligence agencies in trying to find and stop illicit interference from other countries, a request he said he supports. The House Intelligence Committee announced on Wednesday that it would hold a public hearing on the matter of Russian influence next month, and a Senate aide said Facebook, Twitter and Google have been invited to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1. This month, The New York Times reported on evidence of Russian operators creating hundreds or thousands of fake Twitter accounts to flood the network with anti-Clinton messages during the campaign. The cybersecurity company FireEye identified what it called “warlists” of accounts linked to Russian intelligence that sometimes spewed messages like #WarAgainstDemocrats several times a minute. Both DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, which spread the leaked emails and documents and were identified as having been created by Russian intelligence, used accounts that Twitter has not suspended, though they have been dormant for months. In some cases, the Russian exploitation of Facebook and Twitter was linked: “Heart of Texas,” a Facebook page advocating the secession of Texas that was identified as one of 470 fake profiles and pages linked to Russia, also had a Twitter feed — now suspended — called @itstimetosecede. Experts on Russia inside and outside the government say President Vladimir V. Putin had multiple goals in last year’s campaign of hacking, leaking and stealth propaganda. He hoped to damage, if not defeat, Mrs. Clinton, whom he blamed for encouraging pro-democracy protests in Russia and neighboring states. But Mr. Putin also sought to darken the image of the United States, making it a less attractive model for other countries and reducing its international influence, said Mark R. Jacobson, a Georgetown professor and co-author of a new report on Russian influence operations. Last week, Facebook said it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads to Congress. Many of those ads, like the opposing Twitter hashtags on the N.F.L. anthem issue, targeted divisions in American society by simultaneously sending conflicting messages to different users segmented by political and racial characteristics. “What we see over and over again is that a lot of the messaging isn’t about politics, a specific politician, or political parties,” said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. “It’s about creating societal division, identifying divisive issues and fanning the flames.” Her group’s web “dashboard” is called Hamilton 68. It is named for No. 68 of the Federalist Papers, believed to have been written by Alexander Hamilton, which warns of foreign meddling in American elections. The tool does not identify the activity of specific Twitter users but highlights the activity of the 600 accounts that researchers believe are either tied to the Russian government or repeat the themes of its propaganda. For its part, Twitter has not said much about what it plans to say in the Congressional briefing. “Twitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, a cornerstone of all democracies, and will continue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation that violate our Terms of Service,” Twitter said in a statement. Twitter has also said it was working to crack down on bots that distribute tweets en masse or that attempt to manipulate the platform’s trending topics. Colin Crowell, Twitter’s vice president of public policy, government and philanthropy, said in a blog post in June that the company should not be an arbiter of whether a tweet is truthful or not. Because Twitter is open and real-time, he said the platform is the best antidote to misinformation, when “journalists, experts and engaged citizens Tweet side-by-side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds.” Karen North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said the company’s defense has some merit. “Twitter functions more like a broadcast network,” she said. “People say things and everyone can hear it. When false information is stated, people can jump on false statements and challenge it.”",The New York Times
2017,Two Confessions and Claims of Misconduct in Murder Case,"The Staten Island district attorney convicted a man of murder 23 years ago. A lawyer who has investigated the case for five years says he wasn’t the killer. Foster Thompson was convicted in the killing of Cynthia Browning and the shooting of her boss, Alton Staley. He was sentenced to a maximum of life in prison. More than two decades later, a lawyer is trying to persuade the Staten Island district attorney’s office to reopen the case.CreditCreditAndrew White for The New York Times In the rainy early morning of July 4, 1992, two armed men pushed their way into a drug stash house in a third-floor apartment of a Staten Island housing project, not far from the ferry terminal. It was a robbery: hardly the first in the crime-ridden neighborhood of New Brighton in those crime-ridden times. Within minutes of the break-in, a gunfight erupted and a young drug dealer, Cynthia Browning, was dead with a bullet in her head. Her boss, Alton Staley, was shot in the neck by the robbers, but remarkably survived. Months went by without a solid break in the case. But detectives eventually arrested a local man named Foster Thompson, who was 28 at the time and had a history of robbery and gun charges. Over the next two years, Mr. Thompson was tried twice for killing Ms. Browning and shooting Mr. Staley. The first attempt resulted in a mistrial, but he was convicted on the second and sentenced to a maximum of life in prison. But now, after more than two decades, a lawyer who has spent the last five years investigating Mr. Thompson’s case is claiming he was wrongfully convicted and is trying to persuade the Staten Island district attorney’s office to reopen the matter. The lawyer, Abe George, has presented prosecutors with a dossier of videotapes, witness statements and a disputed police report — all of which has been reviewed by The New York Times. The striking amount of evidence Mr. George has amassed suggests his efforts are more than just a case of a lone lawyer on a quixotic quest. His dossier includes suggestions that evidence may have been withheld at Mr. Thompson’s trial and that the former prosecutor who won the conviction had a questionable relationship with a witness after entering private practice. Mr. George has even managed to get confessions from two people who said that they took part in the fatal armed robbery, not Mr. Thompson. “From the inception of the case,” Mr. George said in an interview this month. “I knew that there was something wrong here.” In a recent statement, the Staten Island district attorney’s office said that it had spent a year conducting “a thorough investigation of the allegations,” but added that there was “insufficient evidence” to set aside the jury’s verdict. The statement said that prosecutors would “look at any additional facts if they are brought to light.” Unlike the Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn district attorneys’ offices, the Staten Island office has no unit devoted to identifying wrongful convictions. Questionable cases are usually considered first by the district attorney’s executive team and then assigned for investigation to a prosecutor. At Mr. Thompson’s second trial, the lead prosecutor, Mark Macron, obtained a guilty verdict largely by relying on the testimony of two main witnesses. One was the injured Mr. Staley, who had his own legal problems at the time. On the night he was shot, Mr. Staley was found in the stash house with a gun and drugs. But after he testified against Mr. Thompson, he was never charged with a crime. Prosecutors claim they never struck a deal with Mr. Staley, but long after the trial had ended, Mr. George tried to interview him to see if that indeed was true. By that point, however, something unusual had happened: Mr. Macron had left his job in the district attorney’s office and started representing Mr. Staley as a private lawyer. In October 2015, Mr. George wrote an email to the prosecutor’s office, saying that Mr. Macron had denied him “permission to interview his former witness and present client” — a decision he referred to in a follow-up note as “egregious” and “unacceptable.” The prosecutors responded, saying in their own email, that they would “not be seeking any judicial intervention based upon a purported conflict of interest.” In an interview this month, Mr. Macron said he was simply following his client’s wishes in denying a request to talk about the case. “I talked to Staley about it,” Mr. Macron said. “He didn’t want to speak with Abe George. Mr. Macron added that Mr. Staley needed no encouragement to testify against Mr. Thompson who, he said, had shot him the neck. The other main witness against Mr. Thompson was a drug addict named Denise Concepcion. When she was first interviewed by the police, Ms. Concepcion was unable to identify him as the killer. But that changed after prosecutors called her to testify against him, on the threat of arrest, with a material witness warrant. Mr. Macron said the warrant was needed because Ms. Concepcion was terrified of the defendant. And so, at trial, Ms. Concepcion told the jury that as she was walking up to visit Ms. Browning in the stash house on the night of the shootings, she saw two men lingering in the hallway. One, she claimed, was Mr. Thompson, who was wearing a red hooded sweatshirt. The other was Mr. Thompson’s alleged accomplice, Gilbert Franklin, who was wearing a denim jacket. (Mr. Franklin was also convicted and is serving time.) But then last September, as his investigation deepened, Mr. George received a piece of evidence that seemed to contradict Ms. Concepcion’s story. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, he got hold of a detective’s report, called a DD-5, in which a different witness claimed that it was not Mr. Thompson in the hallway wearing the red sweatshirt, but a man she knew as “Tony.” Trial records show that Mr. Thompson’s first lawyer, who has died, was at least aware of this witness, but Mr. George claims that the DD-5 itself was never turned over. Mr. Macron and officials in the district attorney’s office dispute that claim. In either case, Mr. George was interested in “Tony.” From the moment he started working on the case, Mr. George had heard from Mr. Thompson’s family that the real killer was a man named David Clark, a Jamaican native who often went by the street name “Jamaican Tony.” The family, moreover, knew Mr. Clark: He was married to Mr. Thompson’s sister, Candice. Last year, lending some credence to what was in the detective report, Candice Thompson gave a statement to the district attorney’s office that implicated both herself and “Jamaican Tony” in the crime. Opening herself to prosecution, she admitted that she had been at the stash house when Mr. Clark and another man committed the fatal robbery, not her brother and Mr. Franklin. Armed with this account — and with the DD-5 — Mr. George asked the prosecutors if they would send an investigator to speak with Mr. Clark, who was living in Jamaica. But no one ever went, he said. And so in February, Mr. George went to Jamaica with his own investigator, Eddie Dowd, and Mr. Clark’s daughter, Davina Thompson. Davina Thompson was there, he said, to lure her father to a meeting: She had told him that she had won a free trip to the island and invited him to visit her at a resort. When Mr. Clark showed up, Mr. Dowd confronted him and eventually persuaded him to give a videotaped statement in which he, too, confessed to having committed the robbery himself. “I am convinced more than ever that Foster Thompson is an innocent man who is needlessly rotting in jail for a crime committed by Jamaican Tony,” Mr. George wrote in an email to the district attorney’s office shortly after he returned from Jamaica. Because he believed that the prosecutors still trusted the original testimony of Mr. Staley and Ms. Concepcion, Mr. George continued in his email: “There need not be a debate on the ‘credibility’ of Staley and Concepcion because surely you can agree that the evidence we have obtained to date (i.e. video confessions of both Jamaican Tony and Candice Thompson) would warrant a hearing.” Mr. George has not yet filed a formal motion for a hearing, but he did try another method of bolstering his case. A few months ago, he asked the district attorney’s office if he could test the red sweatshirt that Mr. Thompson had supposedly worn at the scene of the crime for D.N.A. evidence, hoping he could show that it had actually been worn by Mr. Clark — or “Tony.” The sweatshirt, however, had been lost by the police years ago, trial records show. In a memo to the district attorney’s office, Mr. George offered his own theory of the case, suggesting that prosecutors had used the Browning case as a way to pressure Mr. Thompson into giving information on other crimes. Two months before he was arrested in the killing Ms. Browning, Mr. Thompson was taken into custody by federal agents who believed that he had robbed a bank on Staten Island and that his relatives were involved in other robberies. In his memo, delivered in the spring, Mr. George claimed that the district attorney’s office had used the threat of murder charges as “leverage” to persuade Mr. Thompson to implicate himself and his family in the robberies, and to identify his partner, Mr. Franklin, in Ms. Browning’s death. In a telephone interview from prison this month, Mr. Thompson supported that claim, saying that Mr. Macron had sought his cooperation in a meeting when he was still in federal custody. “Macron told me that if I was to help him help the feds with their bank robbery case, then the murder case would disappear,” he said. “I said, ‘I didn’t rob no bank’ and he knew I didn’t commit no murder. So there was nothing I could help him with.” But Mr. Macron flatly denied he ever met Mr. Thompson and dismissed the notion that he needed help in charging Mr. Franklin, saying, “There was plenty of ballistic evidence.” According to Mr. George, while two guns found near the stash house did match those that were used to kill Ms. Browning and injured Mr. Staley, nothing ever tied them to Mr. Thompson. Said Mr. Macron: “There’s nothing to hide here. If credible evidence comes out questioning the conviction, it should be reviewed. But just because people are making noise doesn’t mean anything.”",The New York Times
2017,Two Hurricanes in Two Weeks Bring Two Very Different Reactions,"WEST KENDALL, Fla. — In the psychology of evacuations, what Hurricane Katrina was to Rita in 2005, so Harvey has been to Irma today. Weeks after Katrina devastated New Orleans in August 2005, Hurricane Rita advanced toward the Texas Gulf Coast that September, alarming officials and residents who had just watched Katrina’s destruction and causing a mass evacuation in the Houston region that led to one of the deadliest traffic jams in Texas history. As Irma headed toward South Florida on Friday, a similar exodus was unfolding in parts of the Miami region, inspired at least in part by Harvey’s devastation nearly two weeks ago, but far smoother than the chaos that occurred on Texas highways in 2005. On Friday, Daniel Marte, 23, said he had watched the scenes of Harvey’s destruction on the news, and that pushed him to evacuate with his roommates from the Homestead area of Miami-Dade County to a shelter set up in a high school in West Kendall. “A lot of people died,” Mr. Marte said of Harvey. “I was worried there’s going to be flooding where I live.” Despite that link between Harvey and Irma, two very different evacuation scenarios have been on display over the last two weeks in two parts of the country – the Houston region as it braced for Hurricane Harvey and the Miami region as Irma prepares to strike. Officials in Houston, led by Mayor Sylvester Turner, declined to issue a mass evacuation order as Harvey approached, but officials in Miami-Dade County have called for the evacuation of more than half a million people. Miami’s two main office and condo districts were ordered to evacuate, part of the biggest evacuation Miami-Dade County officials have ever attempted. Low-lying and coastal areas of other Southern Florida counties also were placed under mandatory evacuation orders. Alan Bernstein, a spokesman for Mr. Turner in Houston, said the mayor’s views on the issue of whether to evacuate Houston “have not changed” in the aftermath of Harvey and in light of the evacuations in South Florida. “Irma is totally different,” Mr. Bernstein said in the statement. “It is forecast for a direct hit on populous areas, bringing highly destructive winds and perhaps heavy coastal destruction. That was not the case here, and Mayor Turner would not second-guess an evacuation order for Florida.” One difference is the geography and size. Harris County, which includes Houston, is the third most-populous county in America, with 4.5 million people. Miami-Dade County has 2.7 million people, and is the country’s seventh biggest. Houston is roughly 50 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, while Miami and its string of islands and keys are at the doorstep of the Atlantic Ocean. Because of that geography, officials in Florida are more battle-tested and prepared for hurricanes than those in Texas. The last time a Category 4 hurricane made landfall in Texas was 1961; the benchmark hurricane experience for many Floridians remains the Category-5 Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The situation was also different in Texas and Florida because of the two hurricanes themselves. Houston officials said Hurricane Harvey was not on course to strike the Houston region with destructive winds and storm surge, but was predicted to drop massive amounts of rain. When it comes to potential flooding from heavy rainfall, so-called sheltering-in-place remains the preferred emergency preparedness model, because it is far more dangerous to venture into floodwaters than to remain at home and call for help. The direct hit from Hurricane Harvey was expected to be, and indeed turned out to be, the Corpus Christi area, roughly 200 miles southwest of Houston. Irma’s threat to the Miami-Dade region was more direct. Irma was forecast for a direct or near-direct hit on the cities and counties in the region, with destructive winds and a powerful tidal surge. The sheltering-in-place model used in Houston would put millions of people in jeopardy if used in the Miami-Dade area. “The danger is being blown away, the danger is being cut in half by flying debris that’s going 175 miles per hour,” said Natalie Simpson, an emergency response expert who is a professor of operations management at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, N.Y. “Flooding is very, very dangerous, but you can scramble for higher ground. It’s not so immediately lethal.” In Houston, one issue that played a background role in the decision to not order an evacuation was the memory of Hurricane Rita in 2005. The highways out of Houston were clogged for hours in that evacuation. Thousands of motorists ran out of gas or slept in their cars, and more than 20 nursing home residents died after they evacuated the Houston area and their bus caught fire on Interstate 45 in a Dallas suburb. That chaotic evacuation in 2005 has led to the perception in the Houston region that any future mass evacuations would be equally problematic. “A mass evacuation order for a county of 4.5 million people would have had to have been planned far ahead and might still have resulted in many deaths, as did the less organized Hurricane Rita evacuation in 2005,” said Mr. Bernstein, the spokesman for the Houston mayor. The messaging of local and state leaders has been another factor in the evacuations, with Florida officials proving more effective than those in Texas. As Harvey advanced on Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said that while local officials are the ones who have the authority to order an evacuation, he seemed to suggest an evacuation of the Houston region was appropriate. “I can be suggestive of what I would do and that is, if I were living in the Houston region, as I once did, I would decide to head to areas north of there,” said Mr. Abbott, a Republican. Houston and Harris County officials reacted swiftly to Mr. Abbott’s comments on social media and at news conferences, urging people to stay home, including Mr. Turner, a Democrat. In Florida, there were no mixed signals. Gov. Rick Scott and local officials throughout the state have been campaigning hard for people to evacuate. “You can find 10 excuses not to go,” said Ken Russell, a Miami city commissioner. “There is no reason not to go. You need to get to a safe location.” Evacuations are complex, amorphous events, and as was clear in South Florida on Friday, mandatory evacuations are often viewed as mere options to some residents. Luis E. Cabrera, the acting chief of the Miami Police Department, said he was concerned that by the middle of Friday afternoon many people had not left the evacuation zones. “A lot of people have left,” he said. “But there are also a lot of people hunkered down to weather the storm.” In Kendall, no evacuation order was in effect, and an upscale senior living home called The Palace Suites was packed with residents and staff. Nathalia Montenegro, 20, will continue to work as a server throughout the weekend there, and her mother will stay with her. She said her mother initially planned to stay at her Miami apartment, but decided to leave the apartment and stay with her farther inland at Palace Suites. “My mom was going to stay, but the flooding in Houston scared her,” Ms. Montenegro said.",The New York Times
2017,Two Memoirs Celebrate Muses With Four Legs,"Nonfiction AFTERGLOW (a dog memoir) By Eileen Myles 207 pp. Grove Press. $24. FETCH How a Bad Dog Brought Me Home By Nicole J. Georges 328 pp. Mariner Books/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $17.95. It is one of the conceits of Eileen Myles’s winning new memoir that it was not merely inspired by her deceased pit bull Rosie — memorably described as “a masculine girl, British like an old upper-class dyke” — but that she also had a paw in writing it. And if that wasn’t enough, speaking post-mortem Rosie claims, “I wrote virtually every poem by Eileen Myles from 1990 to 2006” (the years during which she and Myles lived together). It’s true, Myles humbly admits, addressing Rosie some pages later: “I wrote poetry different ever since the advent of you.... I put you in the middle of my life and you never steered me wrong.” Seven years after her death, Rosie, observing Myles at work on “Afterglow,” predicts that, with her help, it will be a much greater success than Myles’s “earlier Eileen-based fictions,” by which she means books like “Chelsea Girls” and “Inferno,” fictions that appear to be actually memoirs. According to Myles, in an interview with the British journal The White Review, “Afterglow” is “actually quite fictional, probably more than any other book I’ve ever written.” Going back over the painful, at times gruesome, details of Rosie’s decline, Myles is unflinching but also irrepressibly humorous. Her grief at losing Rosie is profound; it is also a revelation. Tending to her incontinent dying dog, she recalls, “I thought that’s it. She’s god. And I felt so calm. I’ve found god now.” And: “I felt like a god too. I felt less ambivalently loving than I have ever felt in my life.” Living with Rosie, writes Myles, “I was companioned, seen.” The gift of being seen is key. When, in a later chapter, Myles writes that her beloved father, who died as a result of a horrific alcohol-related accident when Myles was 11, “saw me,” she means it in the same way that Rosie did. In fact, for Myles, Rosie is her dead father, who, after 30 years, “decided to come back again as Rosie because I believe he simply liked me very much.” But Myles also imagines that Rosie has been other dogs, and other people besides her father, including, wildly enough, the third-century Persian prophet Mani, founder of Manichaeism. A mind as searching and honest as Myles’s would not be content to explore the commonplace joys and rewards of dog ownership without also looking at the dark side. “Part discomfort & humiliation and part devotion” is how she describes the relationship. Could it be that, besides being her pet’s nurturer and protector, she was also her abuser? Rosie herself complains of having been cruelly spayed and claims that Myles (or rather, Jethro, as she calls her) “had me raped.” (Pace Rosie, the chapter telling how Myles arranged to have her mated with another pit bull in her living room one rainy summer night is one of the high points of the book.) Myles possesses, in abundance, two qualities of the highest value for a writer, irreverence and relentless curiosity, and here both are on full display. As a prose writer she is naturally, even obsessively, digressive, and the book’s loose, nonlinear form allows her to riff or ruminate on what can seem at times like a maniacal range of subjects, among them alcoholism, feminism, queerness, libraries, the transmigration of souls, the George W. Bush administration, the literal and metaphorical nature of varieties of foam, writers and writing, the art of tapestry, plaid cloth, and the uniforms of U.S. postal workers (Myles’s father worked as a mailman). Given how deeply concerned it is with loss, “Afterglow” is inescapably a sad book, but, because it is a love story, and because, like any serious book about death, it is full of life, it has a celebratory feel to it. “It seems you should obviously always be pleasing somebody with your writing but who,” writes Myles. “That in part is the problem of the writer.” The writing here, by turns playful, heartfelt, wise, compassionate, fantastical and audaciously confessional, should please many. My reluctant leave-taking of Myles and Rosie was softened by “Fetch,” another memoir about a woman in a major relationship with a female dog. Nicole J. Georges was 16 when she acquired from a shelter a pup intended as a Christmas gift to her boyfriend. Short-legged, long-bodied, with a wrinkled face and ears that invite comparison with the flying nun and Dumbo, she appears to be part shar-pei and part dachshund or corgi. When her boyfriend’s parents renege on their agreement to let him adopt her, Georges decides to keep the dog herself. (“Beija was my version of a love child. She was the baby I had in high school, and I saw no option but to stay the course.”) Lucky dog. Given Beija’s behavioral problems, which include peeing indoors, incessant barking and attacking small children, it’s doubtful she would have been permitted to live out the full measure of her days or found a better home than the one Georges struggles over the next 15 years to provide for her. The dream of a good home is central to this charming and tender graphic memoir. Raised in a chaotic household, the late child of a neglectful mother, Georges recalls that she found comfort only in the company of her pets. But she also confesses to taking out on them her childhood rage and frustrations, which in turn gave rise to feelings of being “unworthy and feral” that would haunt her all her life. As a young adult Georges settles in Portland, Oregon, where her home becomes a kind of artists’ commune-cum-flophouse, throbbing with punk energy and alternative creativity, but hardly ideal for a dog of nervous temperament. Beija, soon notorious for being “bad” and “crazy,” is forced to wear a neckerchief saying Don’t Pet Me. But is she wholly to blame? What about strangers who expect her to behave like a stuffed animal whenever they feel entitled to touch her or otherwise invade her personal space? When Georges creates a flier ardently pleading Beija’s case for a right to autonomy and posts copies of it around the neighborhood, she is gratified to discover that at least some people — namely, women — get it: “It’s kind of like feminism,” says one, “but for dogs.” And, for all the disruption she causes, it’s Beija who helps Georges find her path as an artist. “Through zines I found diary comics, and something clicked. You didn’t need superheroes or gags. A person could draw her own life.” And, in Georges’s life, funny-looking, crisis-prone Beija, “constant source of drama and joy,” is an irresistible sidekick. Georges begins self-publishing comics based on their days together. It’s in her zine also that Georges comes out as a lesbian, acknowledging her “immense excitement and deep sense of home around gay ladies.” But finding a true, lasting home with another person turns out to be no easy matter, and after one especially brutal breakup Georges succumbs to suicidal despair. At this darkest hour, reflecting on their long relationship, she sees that her incorrigible but ever-faithful dog, who “loved me even when I lapsed in loving myself,” has been as much a home for her as she has been for Beija. “Neither of us had ever been chosen,” she writes, “but we chose each other.” By never giving up on her bad dog, Georges learns never to give up on herself. Georges’s career has included doing pet portraits as well as comics, and the beguiling black-and-white drawings that illustrate “Fetch” attest to her assertion of finding “real satisfaction by imbuing animal images with emotions.” Muse, lodestar, teacher, therapist, god. No wonder these writers wished to pay tribute to their dogs. Is it possible, though, that each gives her dog a little too much credit for her own accomplishments? I think so. And would that all human weaknesses were so endearing. “Each writer is required to tell a dog’s story,” Rosie says. Here, twice, the thing is done well.",The New York Times
2017,"Two North Korean Spies, a Ukrainian Jail and a Murky Tale","ZHYTOMYR, Ukraine — The North Korean spy, posing as a member of his country’s trade delegation in Belarus, thought he was photographing a secret scientific report on missile technology as he snapped away with a small camera in a dingy garage in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, the home of Ukraine’s Soviet-era rocket industry. But the report he took pictures of was a fake, part of a sting operation mounted by Ukraine’s security service to prevent the leak of missile secrets, and now the spy, 56-year-old Ri Tae-gil, is in prison convicted of espionage. He sleeps on the bottom bunk in a cell shared with eight Ukrainian inmates, four of them convicted murderers. His July 2011 arrest in eastern Ukraine along with a fellow North Korean spy, which was first reported earlier this month by CNN, shows the extent to which Pyongyang has scoured the world for foreign technology to reinvigorate what had been a faltering program to develop long-range missiles. Mr. Ri and his partner, Ryu Song-chol, 46, were arrested just a few days before North Korea’s then leader, Kim Jong-il, announced during a visit to Russia that Pyongyang was considering a moratorium on missile production and nuclear weapons testing. The moratorium never came about. Instead, following Mr. Kim’s death in December 2011 and the ascent to power of his son Kim Jong-un, Pyongyang ramped up both its nuclear and missile programs. In July this year, North Korea for the first time launched missiles that experts said were capable of hitting the United States. While speaking good Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine, Mr. Ri does not talk much, his cellmates said, but he does watch a lot of television, particularly reports on the accelerating progress of a North Korean missile program that he had tried in vain to serve. Instead of prized secrets, he received an eight-year prison term for espionage. His fourth floor cell at the No. 8 Prison in Zhytomyr, a hulking brick building built during the reign of Russia’s last czar, has cable TV. A brick wall in the courtyard below offers a grim reminder of less accommodating times: it is pockmarked with bullet holes left by Stalin’s secret police, the NKVD, later renamed the KGB, which used the spot to execute prisoners. Asked in an interview whether he felt pride at North Korea’s recent string of successful launches, Mr. Ri, who has a family back in Pyongyang, blanched and said he did not want to talk about rockets. Apparently eager to counter a widespread belief that North Korea had made such fast progress by stealing foreign technology, he said that his country “has had good rockets for more than 20 years” and also very good engineers. Denys Chernyshov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of justice, described Mr. Ri and Mr. Ryu as “very well trained. They are tough guys, real spies,” he said. He noted that, despite six years of detention, they had never written or received letters from family or friends. “They live in a total vacuum,” he said. After a string of failed tests with an intermediate range missile, Musudan, that had been the target of American sabotage, North Korea last year suddenly and mysteriously found success. It began with the rollout of a new missile in September that not only worked but also demonstrated a capability to travel ever further distances in a series of tests since then. In July, Pyongyang launched a missile capable of reaching the United States. Seeking to explain North Korea’s mysterious success, some experts have pointed a finger at Ukraine, particularly the Yuzhmash rocket factory and its Yuzhnoye design bureau in Dnipro, the town where Mr. Ri and Mr. Ryu were arrested. Ukraine has adamantly denied allowing leaks of missile technology, pointing to the arrest and conviction of the two spies as proof that the country is capable of combating North Koreans hunting for missile secrets. Ukrainian rockets mostly date to Soviet times but are still far more advanced than anything Pyongyang had until recently been able to produce. Oleksandr Turchynov, the head of Ukraine’s security and defense council, said it was “completely impossible” that North Korea obtained either missile engines or their design documents from Ukraine. The RD-250, a Soviet-era rocket engine that some experts say resembles engines used in recent North Korean launches, used to be produced in Dnipro, Mr. Turchynov said, but production stopped in 1991. The entire production line, he said, was dismantled in 1994. Moreover, he added, Ukraine never made whole engines but only supplied parts to the RD-250’s main manufacturer, Energomash, in Russia. When The New York Times requested permission to visit the Dnipro complex, however, the Yuzhmash factory declined to receive a reporter from the paper. This was despite a plea in August by Ukraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, made in response to a Times article about possible technology leakage from Dnipro, that reporters from the paper visit the factory to “meet Ukrainian partners who have been wrongfully blamed.” Ukraine is particularly sensitive to allegations that it has undermined nonproliferation efforts because it voluntarily gave up a nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. That surrender of power left it highly vulnerable to nuclear-armed Russia when Moscow annexed Crimea in March 2014. Ukraine’s domestic intelligence agency, known as the S.B.U., says it has been tracking North Korean efforts to steal missile technology for years. In addition to arresting Mr. Ri and Mr. Ryu, Ukraine expelled two North Korean diplomats accredited in Moscow who were accused of trying to obtain Ukrainian secrets. Mr. Ri and Mr. Ryu were caught red-handed taking photographs of what had been presented to them as a classified dissertation by a rocket scientist, S.A. Davidov, titled “Forecast methods of the performance capability of capillary intake devices in the fuel tanks of space vehicles.” Mastery of such intake devices would have helped North Korean engineers ensure the steady, uninterrupted flow of fuel, a hurdle that can impede the construction of reliable rocket engines. The dissertation the North Korean pair were given to photograph, however, had been gutted of secret information and filled with useless technical details. Mr. Ri received the fake secrets from V.A. Plekhanov, an employee at Dnipro’s Yuzhnoye design bureau, whom the North Korean had first tried to suborn by appealing to him on ideological grounds as a Communist before offering him about $1,000, the Ukrainian authorities said. Unbeknown to the North Koreans, Mr. Plekhanov alerted the S.B.U. and a trap was set in a cluttered back street garage where he had agreed to hand over the missile secrets. The North Koreans were both seized, along with the camera they used to take photos of the documents. With Mr. Ri and Mr. Ryu now approaching the end of their prison terms — they are scheduled for release next September because their sentences were reduced by two days for every day served in pretrial detention — Ukraine is wondering what will happen to them next. Neither man, according to their cellmates and prison officials, has expressed any eagerness to go back to North Korea, fearing what awaits them and their families. Ukrainian officials believe they may request political asylum in Ukraine or another country after their release, though neither has so far made a request to stay. When Mr. Ryu, who is held in a correctional facility next door to Mr. Ri’s prison in Zhytomyr, was led into a visiting room for an interview he quickly covered his face and tried to run away. “I have nothing to say. Get away from me,” he shouted. “I want to live safely.” Mr. Ri, in a separate meeting, was less abrupt but also declined to answer all but a few preliminary questions. Anatoli Gabitov, the deputy warden, described Mr. Ri as a “super inmate” who never causes trouble. “I wish all our prisoners were like him,” he said. The North Korean spy, however, may not be quite what he seems: On a bookshelf next to his bed is a Russian-language translation of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” the French novel whose protagonist considers himself wrongly imprisoned and, after a spectacular escape, sets about taking revenge on all those responsible for his incarceration.",The New York Times
2017,"Two Pastors in Love, and Only God Knows","Vows Pastor Twanna Gause stepped out of a limousine amid the whir of cameras outside the New Vision Full Gospel Baptist Church in East Orange, N.J. Dressed in an off-white wedding gown and veil that sparkled in the cascading sunshine, she carried a bouquet of white roses and lilies, hugged several guests, then parted a sea of well-wishers on the way to her best friend, Pastor Vanessa Brown, who stood waiting at the altar in a cream-colored long coat called a sherwani and gold Punjabi jutti shoes. The church doors opened, allowing the faint strains of “You Are So Beautiful” to float on the hot August air. Pastor Gause stepped inside, where she was greeted by Bishops Levi Richards and Eugene Gathers, both of the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries. “She’s our spiritual daughter,” Bishop Richards said. Both men walked Ms. Gause down the aisle, a role she had initially hoped would be accepted by her father, the Rev. Sam Gause Sr., a Pentecostal minister who lives in Atlanta. But Mr. Gause, citing “differences in theological beliefs,” refused his daughter’s invitation. “My father would not come here because he does not believe in same-sex marriage,” Ms. Gause said. “He told me the devil tricked me into this, and that if we had been married in biblical times, we would have been stoned to death.” Mr. Gause, who helped raise four other daughters and a son before divorcing their mother, Cathy Dodson, in 1996, held steadfast in his decision. “Twanna very well knows I’m not for that kind of lifestyle,” he said by phone in a calm and stern tone several days after the wedding. “I believe that God wanted us to procreate through a natural process, and by no means am I happy about this because it is unnatural,” he said. “I look at homosexuality as a mental disorder. If I start to tell you that I am an elephant, and start to behave as an elephant, that’s my choice, I choose to become an elephant. But you would probably choose to call a mental institution.” Mr. Gause, long affiliated with the Center of Hope Church of God in Christ in Riverdale, Ga., said he had no immediate plans to contact his daughter. “I will talk to her at some point, I suppose, if she calls me, but I will not initiate the call,” he said. “I do have some words for her that she needs to hear. I’m not going to condemn her or judge her because I don’t have that authority, but judgment has already been established by God.” Ms. Brown, 46, and Ms. Gause, 45, both pastors of Rivers of Living Water United Church of Christ, which has locations in Newark and New York, heard much softer words on their wedding day while holding hands before the Rev. Dr. Yvette Flunder, the presiding bishop of the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries, who read from the First Epistle to the Corinthians. “Love is patient, love is kind. ... Love hopes and endures all things,” Bishop Flunder read, as amens and hallelujahs rang out from some the 200-plus guests who flocked to celebrate a love that has endured for nearly three decades. “Twanna and I go way, way back,” Ms. Brown said. Once upon an Amazing Grace, two choir girls met at a church in Jersey City, and before one of them could clear her throat to sing, she thought she had already caught a glimpse of heaven. “I was like, ‘Oh wow, what in the world, who’s that, she’s beautiful,’” recalled Ms. Gause, who was then a 16-year-old living in Paterson, N.J. “I immediately felt this kind of strange, warm feeling wash over me, and though I had not yet spoken a word to her, I could see myself loving this woman forever. My head was just spinning.” Ms. Brown, then 18 and living in New York, was not struck by the same thunderbolt. “I was oblivious as to how Twanna was feeling,” Ms. Brown said. “I looked at her as this adorable, skinny little girl who I initially thought was so much younger than me, and I had no idea that she liked me in any way other than as a friend.” Ms. Gause, who said she was hoping for a connection, was crushed. “Though it broke my heart, I never said a word about my true feelings for Vanessa because I didn’t want it to hurt our friendship,” she said. “And I never said a word to my father because he was so strict, I knew he wouldn’t understand.” Both grew up in religious families — “We didn’t hang on street corners, go to clubs or do drugs, none of that,” Ms. Gause said. But they spent time together at events sponsored by the Hiya Fellowship of the Saviour Church in Jersey City and at LaGree Baptist Church in Harlem, which were linked through a minister who served both congregations. Their friendship continued to blossom until the day in 1990 when Ms. Gause called Ms. Brown to say that her father was moving the family to Atlanta. “I was devastated,” Ms. Brown said. “Twanna had become my best friend in the whole world, I didn’t know what I would do without her.” They kept in touch, and Ms. Gause moved back to Paterson in 1994, and became engaged to a man there, breaking it off in less than a year and returning to Atlanta, where she toured with a gospel choir and worked as a cosmetologist. “That relationship just didn’t seem right,” Ms. Gause said. “Plus I still had Vanessa on my mind.” But Ms. Brown, who was by then working as a producer and talent coordinator for “Amateur Night” at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, had married a man in 2004. “Even though I was still in love with Vanessa, I never told her it should have been me,” said Ms. Gause, who did not attend the wedding. “But I knew for sure it shouldn’t have been him.” Time, and not much of it, proved Ms. Gause right. By May 2005, five months after it began, Ms. Brown’s first marriage was over. “I should have listened to Twanna,” she said. Later that year, Ms. Brown invited Ms. Gause to give a guest sermon at Oasis of Love, a church in Harlem where she served as an associate pastor. “We went to dinner and started catching up and talking about our lives,” Ms. Brown said. “Twanna seemed so much more mature than I remembered her, and she was very sound in her preaching.” For the first time, Ms. Gause began to express her true feelings, and Ms. Brown began seeing her old friend through “a different set of eyes,” as she put it. After dinner, they strolled through Ms. Brown’s Harlem neighborhood until they came to the brownstone where she lived. They walked up a short flight of stairs, and Ms. Brown reached for a key to open the front door. As she attempted to turn the lock, her hand was suddenly covered by Ms. Gause’s. Ms. Brown turned to find Ms. Gause gazing at her. No words were spoken, though each knew what was coming next. “She had waited a long time to kiss me, and I knew this was it,” Ms. Brown said. “I was so nervous. My heart started racing.” For Ms. Gause, it was heaven-sent, and nearly 30 years in the making. “It was a wonderful, wonderful kiss,” she said. “Well worth the wait.” They began dating long distance, and during a visit to Atlanta in 2006, Ms. Gause introduced Ms. Brown to her father. She told him she was a friend with no elaboration. “I wasn’t quite ready to tell him,” she said. Two years later, Ms. Gause was ready. She and Ms. Brown, in Atlanta to attend a religious conference, arranged a family meeting at the home of Ms. Gause’s mother, who also lives in Atlanta, to tell them that they were together. “My father didn’t take it too well,” Ms. Gause said. Indeed, they were still in Atlanta two days later, when Mr. Gause, carrying a large King James Version of the Bible, confronted them in the lobby of the hotel where the conference was being held. “He slammed the Bible down on a table and said to us, ‘Did you all read this book?’” Ms. Gause said. “He was furious.” During his recent phone conversation, Mr. Gause said he had actually stormed the hotel “to confront their pastor over theological beliefs, but he never showed.” Mr. Gause also made it clear that the passing of time has not healed any wounds. “We all have a conscience,” he said. “It is through that conscience that we hear from our creator as to what is right and what is wrong, and if God did not want us to procreate, then why didn’t he just create billions of people with no gender at all? He must have had a reason for doing what he did.” Mr. Gause, who owned a company in Atlanta that made signs, said: “It was a mistake that her mother even went to the wedding. Had she rejected outright that kind of behavior, and become the lovable person that my daughter was in search of, perhaps Twanna would have had a different idea about that kind of thing, and not gone elsewhere to seek love.” When asked about Mr. Gause’s absence at the wedding reception, an elegant affair at il Tulipano in Cedar Grove, N.J., Bishop Richards said simply: “God has a way of honoring us when others won’t.” Ms. Dodson, who spent most of the evening chatting with Ms. Brown’s mother, Mary Ellen Brown, did not mince words when talking about her ex-husband’s refusal to attend. “He has no right to judge them,” she said. “I tried to get him to come here tonight but it was a losing battle. He asked me why I would even bother showing up, and I said to him, ‘All you need to remember is that Twanna is my daughter, and I love her, and I have her back no matter what she does, and that’s why I’ll be there.’” Ms. Brown, who graduated from New York Theological Seminary in May, and Ms. Gause, who graduated from Essex County Community College with an associate’s degree in social science and is now studying for a bachelor’s in social work at Rutgers, are moving forward with their lives, “with or without my father’s blessings,” Ms. Gause said. “Don’t get me wrong, I still love him,” she said. “I still call him on birthdays and holidays and special occasions, though he never picks up the phone.” “Maybe one day he will realize that nothing has really changed with me except for the fact that I've found my perfect soul mate, and he’ll feel like talking to me again,” she said. “But no matter what my daddy says about me or what he thinks of me, he knows down deep, deep inside that I’ll always be his little girl.”",The New York Times
2017,"Two Proposals, One on the Set of ‘Hamilton’","Mini-Vows Leah Marie Michalos and Rachel Ann Pitkin were married Sept. 16 at the Metropolitan Building in Long Island City, Queens. The Rev. Miriam Niles, a friend of Ms. Pitkin and a nondenominational Christian minister in Washington, officiated, with the Rev. Jeffrey N. Wise, a friend of Ms. Michalos and a Lutheran pastor, taking part. Ms. Michalos (left), 35, is the producing director at the Directors Company, a theater organization that is currently presenting “The Violin” at 59E59 Theaters in Manhattan. She graduated from Ohio State and received a master’s in writing from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She is a daughter of Carolyn Michalos and Dr. Peter G. Michalos of Canton, Ohio. The bride’s father is a dentist in private practice in Canton. Ms. Pitkin, 33, is a history and world religions teacher at the Brooklyn Latin School and an adjunct professor of history at Hostos Community College in the Bronx. She graduated from the State College of New York at Geneseo and received a master’s in history from Queens College. She is the daughter of Joan P. Pitkin and Philip F. Pitkin of Kenmore, N.Y. Her mother is an operations associate at M&T Bank in Buffalo. Her father retired as a pediatric respiratory therapist for the home-care unit of the Children’s Hospital in Buffalo. The couple first met in 2004, when Ms. Pitkin visited a high school friend at Ohio State who turned out to be a close college friend of Ms. Michalos. But the two chatted only briefly. They had their real introduction in 2008, when both were living in New York and that same mutual friend encouraged them to hang out. “Nothing really happened — it’s not a love-at-first-sight story,” Ms. Michalos said. But both were at a point, she said, where they recognized that if something were to develop between them, it would be serious. “It felt right, and maybe that scared both of us,” she said. A few months later, when the two got together again, they didn’t hesitate. “When we dove into it, we dove in headfirst and really committed,” Ms. Michalos said. Ms. Pitkin said, “I knew I loved her and wanted to spend my life with her.” Last year, they agreed that they were ready to marry, but they knew at the outset that there would be two will-you-marry-me events. “We both so wanted that moment of being proposed to,” Ms. Michalos said. Ms. Michalos, a theater producer, decided to make her pitch on the stage of “Hamilton,” because Ms. Pitkin, a history teacher, had a special affinity for the musical. Ms. Michalos engaged the help of a colleague who worked with the creator of “Hamilton,” Lin-Manuel Miranda, and when the time came for the event, Mr. Miranda led Ms. Michalos and Ms. Pitkin through the backstage of the set and then, Ms. Pitkin recalled, discreetly left them alone on center stage after giving a brief description of Alexander Hamilton’s marriage proposal to Eliza Schuyler. “I did not get down on one knee,” Ms. Michalos said. “I could not for the life of me remember what I actually said — my heart was coming out of my mouth and pounding in my chest.” After the couple left the Richard Rodgers Theater, they had a glass of champagne in a Times Square boîte, and then Ms. Pitkin, rather than going to the restaurant that Ms. Michalos had reserved for their engagement dinner, insisted that the two set off on a different route. As they neared the Walter Kerr Theater, Ms. Michalos halted, turned to Ms. Pitkin and said: ““I don’t know if you know this, but the Walter Kerr, that is the night I first realized I loved you.” In 2009, the two had gone to the opening night at the theater for a show that Ms. Michalos’s company had produced. Ms. Michalos suggested they take a selfie at the spot, but Ms. Pitkin shook her off and suggested they proceed about 20 feet farther down the sidewalk. There, in chalk that had only partially been obliterated by rain, Ms. Pitkin had inscribed almost exactly the same words Ms. Michalos had just uttered: “This is where I knew I loved you.” And, having not known that Ms. Michalos’s proposal would precede it, she’d added her own: “Will you marry me?”",The New York Times
2017,Two Trump Children Escape the Traditional Spectacle as School Begins,"WASHINGTON — In this age of smartphones and a politically divided public, President Trump’s two youngest children have managed the nearly impossible: They’ve turned up on their respective school campuses without the traditional news media and security brouhaha that surrounds the first day of school for a commander in chief’s child. There was no breathless coverage as 23-year-old Tiffany Trump, the daughter of Mr. Trump and his second wife, Marla Maples, began law school at Georgetown University a week ago. On Tuesday, the school year quietly began for Barron Trump, the president’s fifth child and youngest son, who earlier this year enrolled at St. Andrew’s Episcopal School in the leafy, school-bus-clogged enclave of Potomac, Md. The school is 20 miles and at least a 30-minute drive from the White House in morning traffic. Schoolgoing children signal to the public that a first family — even one that shuns Washington traditions — has put down tangible roots in the area. But what appears to be a low-key transition belies the complicated logistics of protecting first children and respecting their privacy, according to W. Ralph Basham and Mark J. Sullivan, two of the Secret Service’s recent directors. “The kid wants you to be part of the woodwork,” Mr. Basham said. “They want to have a normal experience, whether it’s in grade school, high school or college.” But it’s extremely difficult for the Secret Service, he said, “to provide them with that and, at the same time, make sure that nothing happens to them.” The Secret Service, which has been financially strained and resource-strapped in recent months by the security demands of the large Trump family, had no comment. The White House, when reached for comment, asked for privacy. Over the past several decades, the pressure has mounted on presidential children as the first-day-of-school ritual has become increasingly scrutinized. President Jimmy Carter’s choice to send his daughter, Amy, to Washington public schools triggered a media circus. The decision by President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton to send their daughter, Chelsea, to the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington made national news. The Obamas’ decision to send their daughters, Sasha and Malia, to the same school in 2009 was also met with intense national interest. When both girls were shuttled to their first day of school by their mother, Michelle Obama, and a team of Secret Service agents, a photographer for Mr. Obama’s transition team captured the proceedings. There was no such photo op on Tuesday. Barron’s privacy has been fiercely guarded by the Trump White House, where officials have taken pains to keep life normal and protect him from those critical of his family. In January, a writer for “Saturday Night Live” was suspended after she mocked the president’s son on Twitter. When a writer for the conservative Daily Caller wrote that the 11-year-old should dress more appropriately in late August, the column drew widespread condemnation from the news media, the White House and a former first child who was once the subject of such criticism: Chelsea Clinton. The exchanged spurred a rare moment of bipartisanship — on Twitter, least — between Mrs. Trump and Ms. Clinton, the daughter of Mr. Trump’s opponent. Kate Andersen Brower, the author of the book “First Women,” said the high level of scrutiny directed at Barron, who unlike previous first children did not grow up with a father in politics, could be a factor in the Trump family’s decision to buck tradition. They skipped elite, progressive-leaning schools like Sidwell Friends and instead chose to send their son to a school farther from the White House. In Maryland, Ms. Andersen Brower said, Barron might get some needed breathing room and distance from Washington, a heavily Democratic city where emotions over the outcome of the election still run high. “Sidwell was very happy to have the Obama daughters,” Ms. Andersen Brower said. “This was a much more fraught situation.” In May, Melania Trump, the first lady, released a statement that said the family had chosen for Barron to attend the school because of its “diverse community” and “commitment to academic excellence.” The coed school, which sits on a 19-acre campus, has a median class size of 15 and six students for each teacher. Tuition is $38,590 for middle school and $40,650 for high school, not including a $1,000 enrollment fee. Georgetown University’s law school tuition is $59,850 a year. In the case of Tiffany Trump, a photo posted to her Instagram account was the only public clue she had arrived in Washington for school. Students there have been quietly wondering for months what Ms. Trump’s presence might mean for security on campus. Students have probably noticed a difference in recent days. When both of the Trump children show up on their campuses, they bring with them much more than school supplies: the highly trained, earpiece-wearing and hardly school-age special agents of the Secret Service. The agency’s black S.U.V.s have toted all recent first children to and from school, and then followed them through the door. That is where it gets complicated, said Mr. Basham and Mr. Sullivan, the former Secret Service directors. “There is no playbook you can go by,” Mr. Basham said. “Of course, recognizing the consequences of something potentially happening is obviously extremely concerning, but it can be an incredibly boring assignment. It’s very challenging to keep yourself alert and focused day after day, sitting at school, waiting for the bell to ring — but they do.” Mr. Sullivan, who led the Secret Service when the Obama daughters attended Sidwell Friends, said the agency did everything it could to attract as little attention as possible on campus. The hope, he said, is that the novelty of a presidential child and government agents passing in the hallway fades over time. “You do everything you can to help them blend in as much as possible,” Mr. Sullivan said. “It gets a lot of attention at first, but after a while, people are going to focused on their own lives.” Outside of St. Andrew’s on Tuesday, the flow of parents and students toward the red brick school buildings was uninterrupted. Save for a noticeable contingent of police officers in squad cars and on motorcycles, there was no sign of disorder. A single news van was camped outside. The Trump children are not the only students in the area with Secret Service details: Back in Washington, school also began at Sidwell Friends, where Sasha Obama is a junior. The Obamas have said they will remain based in the capital at least until she graduates.",The New York Times
2017,"Twyla Tharp’s Back Pages, With Chapters to Come","“This is just a rough draft,” the choreographer Twyla Tharp said on a sunny afternoon in her apartment on Central Park West. “We must be nervous if we’re a writer.” But truthfully, she didn’t seem that anxious as she read material for an upcoming talk in Chicago called “Minimalism and Me.” No, she was in full-on performance mode. “I began my career with a right angle,” she said with a flourish. In 1965, Ms. Tharp unveiled her first work, “Tank Dive”: With straight legs, she bent her body forward with a flat back, in reference to the Egyptian goddess Nut. To her, Nut was simply a horizontal and a vertical figure, without spiritual connotations. “This might not seem much of a toehold,” she continued from her notes about “Tank Dive,” “but to me it was indeed a universe.” This fall, Ms. Tharp, 76, will provide three opportunities for viewers to explore her complex choreographic universe, which has its roots in modern dance but soon grew to include ballet, as well as movies and Broadway. Even if you’ve never watched one of her dances live, you’ve likely felt her influence. Ms. Tharp’s season begins at the Joyce Theater (Sept. 19-Oct. 8). In November comes a premiere at the Royal Ballet in London; and the next month Ms. Tharp travels to the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago for “Minimalism and Me,” the lecture-performance, focusing on her dances created from 1965 to 1970. It’s a lot. There is, however, a common thread: Ms. Tharp is diving into her past to fuel her present. “This is her life,” Linda Shelton, the Joyce’s executive director, said about all the activity. “I think it’s in her DNA, and she doesn’t seem to be slowing down. She’s in the studio all the time. Maybe this is a new chapter. She certainly still has that drive and ambition.” At the Joyce, along with a new work, “Dylan Love Songs” — it is set to music by Bob Dylan, but that’s all it shares with her short-lived 2006 Broadway show, “The Times They Are A-Changin’ ” — Ms. Tharp will also mount two classics. One, “The Fugue,” her 1970 masterpiece performed by three dancers on an amplified stage, takes inspiration from Bach’s “The Musical Offering.” “The Fugue” is based on a 20-count theme that is developed into 20 variations — a marvel of reversals, inversions and repetitions. The other, “The Raggedy Dances,” is less known. This playful dance from 1972 evokes silent-movie comedy — don’t-blink-or-you’ll-miss-’em moments include a robbery scene and a charley horse episode, in which a dancer’s leg cramps up. At an August rehearsal in the Catskills, where Ms. Tharp’s group was in residence, she called the piece “an enterprise in naturalness.” Featuring music by Scott Joplin, William Bolcom and Mozart, “The Raggedy Dances” was revived with the help of Sara Rudner and Rose Marie Wright, two of its original cast members. “Part of the adventure is do you have a classic here or don’t you?” Ms. Tharp said. “If you don’t, then you try to update it; if you do, you leave it be and you live with it. So that’s the test for an old piece like this. We went as close to the original as we possibly could.” At the Royal Ballet, she’s fusing the old and the new. “The Illustrated Farewell” expands her acclaimed “As Time Goes By” by adding a prequel. The original work, set to the third and fourth movements of Haydn’s “Farewell Symphony,” was created for the Joffrey Ballet in 1973. At the time, she didn’t feel ready to tackle the complete score. “I knew I couldn’t do the first two,” movements she said. “No way did I know enough to carry that entire symphony.” But what she created established her as a serious choreographic force in ballet. In The New Yorker, Arlene Croce wrote, “She seems to be on the verge of creating a new style, a new humanity, for classical-ballet dancers.” For the extended version at the Royal Ballet, Ms. Tharp will complete the first two movements, which feature only two dancers, Sarah Lamb and Steven McRae. “I built the entire first two movements, which is 14-some plus odd minutes on them.” There are moments in which one or the other leaves the stage, but those, she said, would be brief. (As an act of stamina, it’s as intense as it is heroic.) “As Time Goes By” will then be performed intact, but with one addition: Ms. Lamb and Mr. McRae will return midway through the finale. Ms. Tharp said she considered “As Time Goes By” her first grown-up ballet. “It was made for ballet dancers with no thought about what modern dance was,” she said. “It was certainly about expanding the classical vocabulary — starting with the classical vocabulary, not with a contemporary movement vocabulary. It was not in the vernacular. I happened to speak both vocabularies.” In Chicago, Ms. Tharp will return to modern dance, fleshing out her early days. After graduating from Barnard College in 1963, she moved to a loft on Franklin Street; in downtown Manhattan, she found herself surrounded by artists including Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly and Agnes Martin. Rehearsal spaces were found by poring over lists of condemned buildings. In one, it was necessary to step over the missing floorboards of a staircase leading to an abandoned gymnasium, she says, and blood from a knife fight on the running track above had dripped into the dancers’ area. But having the freedom to create made all the difference for Ms. Tharp; during this time, she started to figure out what it meant to be an artist. “Minimalism and Me” will spotlight seven early works created before “The Fugue.” Yolanda Cesta Cursach, the museum’s curator of performance, was particularly interested in the period of Ms. Tharp’s career when she worked in nontraditional spaces like museums and parks. “She was not necessarily interested in engaging completely,” Ms. Cursach said. “She created a body of work that was so distinctive in that period. I’ve always wanted to have a platform where it could be experienced and understood in its own terms.” Of those early works, Ms. Tharp said: “They were never intended as dances. They were intended as experiences for us to learn about what movement is, how it can hold a space, how it occupies time, how you engage people — all of these things that I thought were components of what a good dance was.” They set her up to create “The Fugue,” which she referred to as Opus 1. “Up until that time, all of this was adventure, but never considered a dance for posterity,” she said. “ ‘The Fugue’ is.” The museum presentation includes “Tank Dive,” “Re-Moves,” “Disperse,” “Generation” and “Medley”; she’ll illustrate the works with photographs, films and performance, as well as with her meticulous drawings and notations that recorded steps and directions for each dance and dancer. Works of art unto themselves, the drawings began to be a part of her process when she choreographed “Generation,” a 1968 piece for five dancers performing simultaneous solos. “I started looking at all possibilities of movement and started writing it out in longhand,” she said. “Every single shift of weight is notated.” There’s no exhibition planned, but Ms. Cursach, the museum’s curator of performance, said she was interested in the possibility of bringing a show to fruition. Ms. Tharp said she would welcome it. It also helps that unlike others, she isn’t afraid of looking at the past. “It can be very depressing for some people to go back into the past, both to remember how things were and to remember how things weren’t,” she said. “The regret of it. I think people want things to be exactly the way they were then, because they remember how they were then. And they were always younger. That’s called nostalgia.” Instead, Ms. Tharp chooses to see the past as evolution, as a series of steppingstones: “It’s about using all of this accumulation as a launching pad for a future.”",The New York Times
2017,"Tyler Austin, Seizing a Rare Opportunity, Delivers a Win for the Yankees","Yankees 3, Rangers 1 ARLINGTON, Tex. — After looking at the first pitch from reliever Richard Rodriguez, Tyler Austin stepped out of the batter’s box to gather himself. He did not need to remind himself that the bases were loaded and the score tied with one out in the ninth inning. Austin needed only to remember to relax, so he took a deep breath, slowly exhaled and then dug in at the plate. “I was a little nervous walking up there,” said Austin, who had entered the game to play first base in the bottom of the eighth. “Once I saw the first pitch, I kind of calmed myself down and just tried to get something and not do too much with it.” Austin did not do too much, but he did enough with the next pitch — lining a single to left field — to help the Yankees to a come-from-behind 3-1 victory over the Texas Rangers on Saturday afternoon. There were heroes aplenty for the Yankees. Luis Severino was brilliant, allowing only one hit through seven innings. Aroldis Chapman returned to the closer’s role with a spotless ninth. And Matt Holliday, Jacoby Ellsbury and Chase Headley delivered smart at-bats as the Yankees rallied. But it was hard to find a more unexpected contributor than Austin. His season has been waylaid by injuries. His opportunity on Saturday arose only because rosters can be expanded in September. And his future in the organization is tenuous. “The big thing is, I try to enjoy these moments as much as I can, whether I strike out on three pitches or get a big hit,” Austin said. “I just try to cherish these moments, because they’re not going to last forever and you don’t know how many of them you’re going to get.” Those are words of a wizened veteran, not a 26-year-old from Conyers, Ga., who has played in only 43 major league games. But Austin seems to know his place in the organization, where there are doubts about whether he can bloom into a regular contributor as long as Greg Bird is viewed as the first baseman of the present and future. Still, Austin has shown a capacity for rising to the occasion, ever since hitting a home run last summer at Yankee Stadium in his first major league at-bat. He hit a game-ending homer against Tampa Bay last September, and last month he belted a three-run homer off the Red Sox ace Chris Sale in a 4-3 win at Fenway Park. This season, though, Austin’s biggest obstacle has been staying healthy. He arrived early for spring training, intent on showing the Yankees — who did not view him as an outfield candidate — that he could play first base, a new position. But while taking batting practice on a field at the minor league complex, he fouled a ball off his foot. Several days later, he was sent for precautionary X-rays, which revealed a fracture. While the Yankees began preparing for the season, Austin was whisking around the clubhouse on a scooter. When doctors later discovered that the fracture was beneath a tendon, a projected four- to-six-week recovery turned into one of more than three months. When Austin did return from a rehab assignment in June, he lasted a little more than three weeks before straining a hamstring, which sidelined him for six more weeks. Before Saturday, he had had only one at-bat since being recalled from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday. “It’s definitely not the way you draw it up,” Austin said of his season. “I think I have 220 at-bats in the entire season. Guys get that in the first month and a half, two months.” But at this time of the year, as playoff races head down the homestretch, seasons can be made in moments, and the Yankees had a few of them in Saturday’s heartening win. For seven innings, they had been locked down by Andrew Cashner, who has a lumberjack’s beard and a fastball that he spotted all over the strike zone. He carried a 1-0 lead into the eighth, courtesy of the only hit that Severino allowed — a two-out, fifth-inning double into the right-field corner by Brett Nicholas, which scored Will Middlebrooks from first base. But when Cashner hit Todd Frazier on the elbow, he was lifted for the left-hander Alex Claudio. Manager Joe Girardi countered by sending Holliday to hit for Bird, and he stroked a single to right, sending Frazier to third. After Brett Gardner popped up, Headley drove a fly ball deep enough to score Frazier, tying the score at 1-1. The Rangers’ inability to complete a routine 5-4-3 double play left Aaron Judge on first and delivered an opportunity for the Yankees to take the lead in the ninth. Ellsbury grounded a 3-2 pitch from Claudio to right field, sending Judge to third. After Frazier was hit by a pitch again, this time in the biceps, Austin delivered his single. Gardner popped up for the second out, but then Headley drew another walk to force home another run. Frazier later discussed the discomfort of the two hit-by-pitches, saying the first one had left a welt the size of a Ping-Pong ball on his elbow. He laughed when he was told that Austin, whose locker is beside his, had said he was nervous at the plate in the ninth. “You should be,” Frazier said. “My dad always told me: You can be nervous, just never be scared. If you’re not nervous, that means you don’t care.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Tyranny of the Minority,"Michelle Goldberg This is Michelle Goldberg’s debut column. Since Donald Trump’s cataclysmic election, the unthinkable has become ordinary. We’ve grown used to naked profiteering off the presidency, an administration that calls for the firing of private citizens for political dissent and nuclear diplomacy conducted via Twitter taunts. Here, in my debut as a New York Times columnist, I want to discuss a structural problem that both underlies and transcends our current political nightmare: We have entered a period of minority rule. I don’t just mean the fact that Trump became president despite his decisive loss in the popular vote, though that shouldn’t be forgotten. Worse, the majority of voters who disapprove of Trump have little power to force Congress to curb him. A combination of gerrymandering and the tight clustering of Democrats in urban areas means that even if Democrats get significantly more overall votes than Republicans in the midterms — which polls show is probable — they may not take back the House of Representatives. (According to a Brookings Institution analysis, in 2016, Republicans won 55.2 percent of seats with just under 50 percent of votes cast for Congress.) And because of the quirks of the 2018 Senate map, Democrats are extremely unlikely to reclaim that chamber, even if most voters would prefer Democratic control. Some analysts have even suggested that Republicans could emerge from 2018 with a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority. Our Constitution has always had a small-state bias, but the effects have become more pronounced as the population discrepancy between the smallest states and the largest states has grown. “Given contemporary demography, a little bit less than 50 percent of the country lives in 40 of the 50 states,” Sanford Levinson, a constitutional law scholar at the University of Texas, told me. “Roughly half the country gets 80 percent of the votes in the Senate, and the other half of the country gets 20 percent.” The distortion carries over to the Electoral College, where each state’s number of electors is determined by the size of its congressional delegation. This would matter less if the United States weren’t so geographically polarized. But America is now two countries, eyeing each other across a chasm of distrust and contempt. One is urban, diverse and outward-looking. This is the America that’s growing. The other is white, provincial and culturally revanchist. This is the America that’s in charge. Twice in the last 17 years, Republicans have lost the popular vote but won the presidency, and it could happen again. In July, Senator Sherrod Brown told The Washington Post, “It’s not out of the question that in 2020, if nothing changes, Democrats could win the popular vote by five million and lose the Electoral College because of the Great Lakes states.” He meant that as a warning to Democrats to pay attention to the Midwest. But it could just as easily be taken as a warning about the stability of our democracy. I recently had the chance to ask Gov. Jerry Brown of California what might happen if we have more elections like 2016, where a majority of voters and a supermajority of Californians are thwarted. Polls already show a third of Californians favor secession. Could that fringe movement become mainstream? Brown said it was “not beyond the realm of possibility” that the country could eventually break apart, even if he doesn’t think it’s likely. Conservatives are often unmoved by complaints that our system is undemocratic, arguing that America was intended not as a democracy but a republic. But if this was true at the founding, it’s probably not how most Americans understand their country today, when “undemocratic” is considered a political epithet. Before Trump, there was enough overlap between popular will and electoral outcome to make the issue largely semantic. Now it’s existential. Certainly, we need checks on the tyranny of the majority. But what we have now is the tyranny of the minority. There are ways out. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact — a plan in which states agree to award all their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner — could circumvent the Electoral College if enough states enacted it. Don Beyer, a Democratic representative from Virginia, has introduced the Fair Representation Act, which would change the way the House is elected, replacing single-member districts with larger districts represented by several people. They’d be chosen by a system of ranked voting that would allow third parties to compete without becoming spoilers, while giving political minorities a say in the process. The resulting delegations, Beyer told me, would be more likely to be proportional, creating space for Massachusetts Republicans as well as Oklahoma Democrats. Enactment of either of these plans, which would transform the ways we choose our leaders, is remote. But absent reform, our system could eventually face a legitimacy crisis. Levinson, perhaps the most prominent among progressive critics of the Constitution, argues that the crisis is already here: “At some point we need to discuss the extent to which the entire constitutional system is full of these anti-majoritarian aspects.” Trump’s election has revealed many dark truths about this country. One of them is: We’re a lot less democratic than we might think.",The New York Times

2017,T’s Design & Luxury Issue: Editor’s Letter,"Editor’s Letter Of all the surprises that greet an American on her first trip abroad, the most transformative may be an understanding of how differently we conceive of time. ‘‘Old’’ in American terms is not old anywhere else. (‘‘This sketch was done in the 1800s,’’ I remember telling a Chinese college friend, awe-struck by the work’s provenance. ‘‘Oh,’’ she said, ‘‘so not too long ago.’’) We are a young country, and like most young entities — be they people or states — our internal metronome ticks a little faster; the land we inhabit may in fact be home to ancient civilizations, but America itself is new, with a sense of impatience, adventure, excitability and a cheerful lack of perspective (either charming or dangerous, depending on your point of view and the circumstances) that only the young possess. When you are immature, every bad thing can feel like a crisis, and every good thing like ecstasy; the rest of the world watches us with a sense of weariness and unflappability that is earned only after many centuries of witnessing governments and empires and civilizations and self-styled saviors rise, crescendo and tumble. The accretion of history is relentless, and endless. Our admiration for this kind of equanimity may explain in part why T has long looked for design inspiration from countries that wear their histories with ease. Any first-time (or hundredth-time, for that matter) traveler to Rome can’t help but marvel at how lightly, and with what matter-of-factness, the Italians live among antiquities: A walk down the street is a stroll across thousands of years; the 2,000-plus-year-old Largo di Torre Argentina, excavated in the late 1920s, was where Caesar died, but it is also where the city’s cats congregate for a sun-drunk loll. Other cities would have placed such a monument in a museum, behind walls and off-limits — here, though, there is so much history that such an approach is impossible. Instead, the Italians have learned that every building, every structure, is a palimpsest, and that their lives within it, superannuated or brief, contribute another layer to its long narrative. Certainly this is true for the interior architect and furniture designer Vincenzo De Cotiis, whose Milan apartment is one of those only-in-Italy spaces: an 18th-century palazzo with 19th-century floors and 21st-century dyed-velvet daybeds, in which everything coexists in inexplicable harmony. As T’s writer at large Nancy Hass explains, De Cotiis’s genius as a designer lies in his ability to know when to do nothing, when to stop updating, in order to make a space that in eliding time becomes timeless. ‘‘Imperfection,’’ De Cotiis says, ‘‘takes longer than perfection.’’ Great design doesn’t choose between the old and the new: It combines them, and from it is born something else, something out of time altogether. That same instinct — to borrow; to adapt; to make new — has been adopted as well by the Western architects exploring an 18th-century Japanese technique called shou sugi ban, which is a method of protecting wood by charring it with fire. The process — which, as writer Amanda Fortini notes, leaves wood ‘‘bituminous-black and scaly, like alligator skin that’s been singed’’ — is thought to have been developed to secure rice and grain storehouses, but has been recently discovered by American and European designers, who are entranced by its slightly spooky inkiness, and by the pleasing paradox of making something fire-retardant by setting it aflame. And why shouldn’t they? The result, whether applied to an eighth-century pagoda near Kyoto or a built-just-last-year saltbox in New England, is equally arresting. It is a reminder that good design — like a good idea — is always relevant, and that context, while important, isn’t everything: Sometimes, all you need is the opportunity to see something made by someone very long ago to make you view the world around you anew.",The New York Times
2017,T’s Men’s Style Issue: Editor’s Letter,"Editor’s Letter One of the sustaining fictions of being a magazine editor is that you somehow determine the publication you produce. Strictly speaking, of course, this is true: It is editors who generate the ideas for the stories, who assign and edit the text and the photos, who style the shoots and design the layouts and fact-check and copy-edit — it would not exist without us. Yet at some undefinable point in the process, the relationship between the creator and the created shifts, and when you look through the finished product, you are invariably surprised. It is only when you see it as a whole that you are at last able to recognize the patterns — the obsessions; the questions — that you wove into its weft, sometimes only semiconsciously. Anyone who makes things for a living understands this sensation: the realization that the object you thought you were making, be it a book or a shirt or a film, is sometimes not what actually gets made. And so what were we thinking of and obsessing about, the staff of T, when we were compiling this issue? For one, about how fashion not only mirrors, but is often deliberately oppositional to, the cultural moment in which it’s conceived. In ‘‘The New Normal,’’, Alexander Fury argues that there is something intentionally recessive — radically banal, even — about the current men’s wear collections. Leave the posturing and peacocking to the politicians; this season, designers imagined men in cardigans, corduroys and plainspoken jackets, all in humble, modest tones: wren-brown, pigeon-gray, mushroom-white. That same matter-of-fact spirit made its way into tailoring, too, as you’ll see in our surveillance-inspired story — suits this season are distinguished not by their flourishes, but by their straightforwardness, their very lack of gimmicks. Speaking of surveillance: It seems we were also fascinated by what it means to be a citizen in an age in which we choose, daily, not to consider how fully our lives are mapped and recorded — and, as the American artist Trevor Paglen asks us to contemplate, how we might react when faced with the evidence of our purposeful ignorance. Megan O’Grady’s story about Paglen, ‘‘They’re Watching,’’ reminds us that while a certain suspension of mistrust is necessary to live in the society we’ve created, it is, often, art’s role to awaken us to the potential perils of ignoring what we’d rather not examine. Paglen is an iconoclast in the true definition of the word: someone whose work provokes questions about the institutions (the government, the military, the technology industry) we live with in uneasy equilibrium. And it is, in the end, iconoclasts who excite us most — the people who are flamethrowers in their own fields. Along with Paglen, this is true of the actor Joaquin Phoenix, whose roles have little in common save their distinctiveness. And it was especially true of the British author and explorer Bruce Chatwin, to whom another iconoclast and another Bruce — Weber — pays loving tribute in ‘‘Nowhere Man.’’ Chatwin was a genius of a writer — one has only to read his spellbinding 1977 travelogue, ‘‘In Patagonia,’’ to understand this — but what has always, and equally, bewitched me about him was how lightly he seemed to move through the world, how he understood, from a young age, that the idea of home is a fantasy, a romance of belonging that doesn’t actually exist. His was, by any definition, a well-populated life, well-filled with people and adventures and things (before he became a writer, Chatwin was an antiquities and Impressionist art expert at Sotheby’s and would remain an inveterate collector, despite his constant movement): many lifetimes crammed into one. Chatwin’s own life, however, was too brief. He died in 1989 at 48, of an AIDS-related illness. But before he did, one wonders what previously unnoticed patterns — obsessions; questions — he found in his own existence. Would even an observer as keen as he have been surprised by evidence of his actions, the stuff he accumulated and lost? One imagines so. For a life, finally, is the ultimate creation, one whose narrative and essence often elude us until the very end. But it is the people who know this, and who spend their days trying to answer the riddles of their own selfhood anyway, who make the art that endures, transforms and, ultimately, inspires.",The New York Times
2017,U.K. Police Arrest 3 More Over Parsons Green Attack,"LONDON — Three people have been arrested in a 24-hour period in Wales in connection with the terrorist attack at a London Tube station that briefly sowed panic on the city’s transport system last week, the police said on Wednesday, bringing the number of people in custody to five. Scotland Yard said two men, ages 48 and 30, were arrested on Wednesday under counterterrorism laws in Newport, a university city in southeast Wales not far from Cardiff, as part of the investigation into the attack that injured at least 30 people. The arrests came a day after the police said they had detained a 25-year-old man in Wales over the attack, the fifth major assault in Britain this year and the fourth in London. The Islamic State militant group said after the attack that a “detachment” of its fighters had been behind it. The authorities are trying to piece together the events leading up to the bombing, to ascertain whether those involved had been influenced by extremists, and whether they had acted alone or were part of a wider network. “This continues to be a fast-moving investigation — a significant amount of activity has taken place since the attack on Friday,” Cmdr. Dean Haydon, who leads the Counterterrorism Command at the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. “We now have five men in custody and searches are continuing at four addresses. Detectives are carrying out extensive inquiries to determine the full facts behind the attack.” The bombing prompted the British authorities to briefly raise the terrorism threat to the highest possible level, and Commander Haydon asked the public to come forward with any information they might have and to be vigilant for anything that could suggest a terrorist threat. “We are asking the public to look out for anything that seems out of place, unusual or just doesn’t seem to fit in with day-to-day life,” he said. “It may be nothing, but if you see or hear anything that could be terrorist-related, trust your instincts, then act, and call us.” On Saturday, Sunbury-on-Thames, a suburb southwest of London, was shaken after the police arrested two men in connection with the attack: An 18-year-old Iraqi orphan who had a reputation for getting into fights and had been in the foster care of a retired couple, and a 21-year-old from Syria who had escaped the civil war there and was working at a fried-chicken shop. The 18-year-old, who has not been publicly identified, was arrested Saturday morning in the departures area at the port of Dover, where he appeared to be trying to leave the country. The 21-year-old, who was arrested outside Aladdin’s, the shop in the outer London borough of Hounslow where he worked, has been identified as Yahyah Farroukh. In an interview, his brother said that their family had run a bakery in Damascus, Syria, and that Yahyah had opposed President Bashar al-Assad. video OpinionBen Judah",The New York Times
2017,U.K.’s Fancy New Span Promises to Induce Bridge Envy,"LONDON — When the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge opened late last month in New York State — a $4 billion structure spanning the Hudson River that replaced the ramshackle Tappan Zee Bridge — New Yorkers were triumphant. A brass band played “Don’t Stop Believin’” as passers-by gave the 3.2-mile-long bridge and its eight 419-foot tall towers rave reviews. It is perhaps a good thing, then, that they were not comparing the Cuomo bridge with another soon-to-be opened crossing in faraway Scotland over the famed Firth of Forth. Britons could be forgiven for a bit of triumphalism themselves after Queen Elizabeth II cut a blue ribbon this week to formally open the $1.7 billion Queensferry Crossing, which connects Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to the north of the country. The BBC has heralded the span as “the longest three-tower, cable-stayed bridge in the world.” Specifically, the bridge is suspended by 23,000 miles of cables, almost enough to wrap around the Equator, the Scottish government says. The bridge was also blessed by the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland on Monday, and an estimated 10,000 residents and students were allowed to walk across the bridge on Tuesday, before it opens to traffic on Thursday. This being Britain, it was also duly noted that, at 689 feet high, the new bridge was akin to about 48 double-decker buses stacked one on top of another, making it the tallest in the land. The modernist crossing — illuminated by a light show ahead of its opening — was constructed using 35,000 tons of steel. For the 91-year-old queen, the ceremonies may have had a familiar ring: It was 53 years ago that she formally opened the bridge the new one is designed to supplement. (In a twist of coincidence, the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, newly christened for the late New York State governor, had the distinction of being opened by his son, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who arrived in a yellow 1955 Corvette.) Still, as The Guardian newspaper noted with pride, “The Firth of Forth will be one of the few major waterways in the world spanned by bridges built in three consecutive centuries.” (The Forth Road Bridge was opened by the queen in 1964, while the Forth Rail Bridge, a wonder of the Victorian age, was constructed beginning in 1883.) In Britain, a nation obsessed by weather, the Queensferry Crossing is made of hardy stuff and is expected to remain open, regardless of the elements, thanks to its special wind shields. At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the queen paid tribute to British engineering prowess, saying, “The three magnificent structures we see here span three centuries, are all feats of modern engineering, and a tribute to the vision and remarkable skill of those who designed and built them.”",The New York Times
2017,U.N. Group Accuses Burundi Leaders of Crimes Against Humanity,"GENEVA — For more than two years, critics of President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi and independent activists have fallen victim to homicide, have disappeared into secret detention centers or escaped to neighboring countries, recounting torture and rape at the hands of the military and the police. Now, United Nations human rights investigators say they believe Burundi’s top leaders and state security agencies committed crimes against humanity. A panel of investigators set up by the United Nations Human Rights Council a year ago said on Monday that it delivered a list of suspects to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and was giving the Security Council another list of people it said should face sanctions. It urged the International Criminal Court to open an inquiry. As the panel prepares to present its findings this month to the 47-member Human Rights Council, which includes Burundi, its report also raises questions about whether the country should be allowed to remain on the council. “We were struck by the scale and the brutality of the violations,” Fatsah Ouguergouz, an Algerian jurist who led the three-person panel, said in a statement. The panel interviewed more than 500 witnesses over several months. Mr. Ouguergouz did not name Mr. Nkurunziza as a suspect, but the panel attributed the crimes to “the highest levels of the state.” It also described a parallel system of government in which major decisions, including some that led to severe human rights violations, were made by the president and a small entourage of people close to him. “The president is the spider in the center of this parallel system web,” Françoise Hampson, a member of the panel, said in an interview. Mr. Nkurunziza also controlled the state intelligence agency and other government organizations, and was therefore responsible for their conduct, she added. The panel focused on events since April 2015, when Mr. Nkurunziza announced his intention to run for a third term — a violation of Burundi’s Constitution — leading to political unrest and a failed coup the next month. It also resulted in a ferocious crackdown by security forces on anyone suspected of opposition, causing what the panel called a pervasive climate of fear. Mr. Ouguergouz said it was not possible to assess the number of victims, but the panel believes that hundreds of people were executed, thousands detained and more than 400,000 Burundians fled the country. The panel found that the abuses “were frequently of an extremely cruel nature,” and in many instances inflicted serious physical and psychological trauma on victims, most of whom were young men suspected of opposition activities or sympathies. Perpetrators identified by the panel include high-level officials of the country’s National Intelligence Services and the national police force, military officials and members of Imbonerakure, the ruling party’s youth league. The panel’s investigations followed up an initial report issued a year ago that documented 564 killings in Burundi from April 2015 through August 2016 and said those numbers were probably conservative. Since 2016, the panel said, the authorities had committed some abuses “in a more clandestine but equally brutal manner.” The testimony collected by the panel included: A woman’s description of being held down and repeatedly raped by men wearing police uniforms who had forced their way into her home after her husband was arrested. A man’ description of being held by the national intelligence agency in a cell with several bodies, some of them decapitated, and being threatened with the same fate if he did not reveal the information demanded. “He insisted on asking the same question,” one witness said of another officer, who questioned a group of men in the headquarters of the riot police, in Bujumbura, the capital. Then, the witness said, the officer pulled out a pistol and shot one of the men in the head, killing him. The panel said that it had also received reports of attacks by armed opposition groups against the military and the police, but that its ability to investigate those events had been hampered because the government would not cooperate and declined repeated applications to visit Burundi. That refusal to cooperate with a panel created by the Human Rights Council flouted a core requirement for membership in the group, the world’s top human rights body. With the evidence that Burundi’s leaders committed crimes against humanity, the country’s membership on the council puts a renewed focus on the credibility of an institution that is responsible for upholding human rights globally but includes some of the worst offenders. Keeping major abusers off the council is among the changes that Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, has demanded as a condition for continued American membership. The panel did not make a recommendation on Burundi’s membership, but said it thought the issue should be reviewed in light of its report. “The fight against impunity, including in Burundi, has to be the top priority,” Ms. Hampson said. The council will decide this month whether to extend the panel’s powers of inquiry, and diplomats say it may also call for a review of Burundi’s membership by the United Nations General Assembly, which elects council members. “Cooperation with council mechanisms is not optional, but a requirement of membership, and there should be consequences for persistent noncompliance,” John Fisher, Human Rights Watch’s Geneva director, said in a statement “The situation in Burundi will not improve until there is an end to the impunity that lies at the heart of the crisis.” The International Criminal Court in The Hague has started a preliminary investigation of Burundi, which announced in October 2016 that it planned to withdraw from that body in a year. The withdrawal will take effect in October, but the court continues to have jurisdiction to investigate events that occur in Burundi until the withdrawal. The court would need a resolution from the United Nations Security Council to investigate events that occur later.",The New York Times
2017,U.N. Panel Faults Syria’s Military for Chemical Attack,"GENEVA — United Nations investigators added their voices on Wednesday to a mountain of evidence of the Syrian military’s responsibility for a chemical attack on a rebel-held town five months ago that left villagers foaming at the mouth and gasping for breath. A United Nations Commission of Inquiry monitoring the six-year conflict in Syria said that Sukhoi 22 aircraft operated by the Syrian Air Force carried out the attack on the village of Khan Sheikhoun early on April 4. It killed at least 83 people, injured close to 300 others and prompted President Trump to order dozens of cruise missile strikes on the airfield from which the jet fighters had launched their attack. The panel’s findings are the first authoritative statement to pin responsibility for the attack unequivocally on the Syrian government. Although a number of foreign governments, watchdogs and news organizations, including The New York Times, had concluded that Syrian forces were most likely behind the attack, the latest report — released by a body tasked with investigating violations by all sides in the conflict — carries more weight and will be harder for the Syrian government and its allies to dismiss as politicized. Moreover, the panel said that Khan Sheikhoun was the site of just one of at least 20 chemical weapons attacks carried out from March 2013 to March 2017 by government forces. (The number of reported, but not confirmed, uses of chemical weapons is vastly higher.) In March, for example, three people, including a surgeon and two patients, died in an attack on an underground hospital in Idlib Province after a helicopter dropped a barrel bomb that dispensed what appeared to be chlorine gas, the panel found. The White House released a declassified four-page report that details United States intelligence on the chemical weapons attack, asserting that the Syrian and Russian governments have sought to confuse the world community about the assault through disinformation and “false narratives.” “The real significance of the U.N. commission’s report isn’t necessarily its conclusions — these were widely known already — but that its release comes just as the international community is loosening or removing altogether its opposition to Assad’s continued rule,” said Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. He said the report also underscored a failure by the Obama administration to respond effectively when Syria’s military carried out a chemical weapons attack in August 2013, despite President Barack Obama’s having declared the use of chemical weapons “a red line.” Mr. Obama effectively set aside a military response by asking Congress to decide; he later took credit for an agreement with Russia to remove Syria’s chemical stockpiles — a promise that was not carried out. The United Nations panel based its conclusion on interviews with 43 victims and witnesses of the attack, logs of aircraft movements, analysis of satellite and photographs, and the findings of a fact-finding mission set up by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which analyzed medical samples from victims. In June, that organization confirmed the use of sarin nerve agent, or similar toxic weapons, in the attack, but it did not assign blame. The United Nations panel said Syrian jets had dropped three bombs — including what appeared to be a Soviet-era chemical bomb armed with sarin or a sarinlike substance — releasing a cloud of gas. Some victims died in bed and were not found until later that day, the panel said, citing the case of a woman who had returned from the fields to find her four children had died. Hours after the attack, the panel said, air force fighters returned to carry out a series of strikes on a medical point in Khan Sheikhoun and a civil defense center that were treating gas victims. The attack occurred as Syrian and Russian forces carried out airstrikes near Khan Sheikhoun, according to Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, the chairman of the International Commission of Inquiry for Syria. The campaign targeted medical facilities, including the main hospital in the area, reducing the access to treatment for victims of the sarin attack and driving up the number of casualties, the panel said. The panel also reported on Wednesday on other war crimes committed in Syria from March to July, finding that more than 600,000 people were still cut off from food and medical supplies and facing indiscriminate bombardment. De-escalation zones in Syria, which the country’s warring parties agreed to with Iran, Russia and Turkey at talks in Kazakhstan in May, have led to a reduction in violence in some areas, but violence increased elsewhere as armed groups scrambled to consolidate control of territory. Government forces and armed groups struck deals for the evacuation of fighters and civilians from seven towns in April and May, but while humanitarian organizations helped some of the movements, the evacuations were forced and as a result amounted to war crimes, the panel said. Civilians were not consulted on whether they wanted to leave or where they would go. Many left because they feared being jailed or forced into military service — with no guarantee they would be able to return. The panel expressed deep concern over the mounting civilian toll from airstrikes by a United States-led coalition. It determined that 38 people, including a woman and five children, had been killed in an American airstrike on a group of buildings used for religious meetings in Al Jinah, in western Aleppo Province, in March. The United States Central Command said in June that the strike had been lawful because it had targeted a meeting of Qaeda operatives, and that only one civilian had died. But United Nations investigators said the United States had failed to take sufficient precautions to protect civilians and that the attack amounted to a gross violation of international law. The panel’s investigators said the United States had sought to limit collateral damage using 10 bombs that produced minimal blast and fragmentation to hit the building, before following up with two missiles fired by a drone at people fleeing. But military planners of the attack should have been aware that the building was a religious complex, Mr. Pinheiro said. “The commission has not found any evidence that such an Al Qaeda meeting was taking place,” he said.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Charges 4 Turks With Conspiring to Violate Iran Sanctions,"Federal prosecutors in New York announced on Wednesday the filing of a new indictment that charges a former Turkish economy minister and three other Turks with participating in a broad conspiracy to violate the United States’ sanctions against Iran. The new charges represent a significant expansion of a case that had already drawn the attention of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, senior members of the Trump administration and President Trump’s informal adviser, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani has been retained by one defendant, Reza Zarrab, to try to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to his case. Mr. Giuliani has met with Mr. Erdogan to discuss the case; in the past, Mr. Erdogan claimed there were “malicious” intentions behind Mr. Zarrab’s prosecution. Prosecutors have charged that Mr. Zarrab, a gold trader and dual citizen of Iran and Turkey, and his co-defendants conspired to facilitate millions of dollars in transactions on behalf of Iran and other sanctioned entities through the use of front companies and false documentation. The most prominent new defendant charged was Mehmet Zafer Caglayan, 59, who served as the Turkish economy minister from 2011 until 2013 and currently serves in the Turkish Parliament, the indictment said. While Mr. Caglayan was a minister, the indictment charged, he “received tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bribes in cash and jewelry from the proceeds of the scheme to provide services” to the Iranian government and concealed those services from United States regulators. The new indictment also said that high-ranking government officials in Iran and Turkey “participated in and protected this scheme,” with some officials taking bribes. In addition, the indictment said, the leaders of a bank that is majority-owned by the Turkish government “participated in the design of fraudulent transactions intended to deceive U.S. regulators and foreign banks.” Other court filings show it is Halkbank. The new indictment comes at a time of testy relations between Turkey and the United States, which are both members of NATO. Last week, Mr. Erdogan denounced another federal indictment — against three of his bodyguards over a brawl in Washington during his visit in May. Twelve other Turkish security officers were charged in that case in June. Mr. Erdogan has also repeatedly called on the American authorities to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. He is the leader of a Turkish Muslim sect accused by Mr. Erdogan of having helped orchestrate an attempted coup that roiled Turkey in July 2016. Mr. Gulen, a longtime critic of Mr. Erdogan’s, has denied any connection to the coup attempt and vowed to fight extradition. In addition to Mr. Caglayan, the new indictment charged Suleyman Aslan, a former general manager of the bank; Levent Balkan, another former bank executive; and Abdullah Happani, an associate of Mr. Zarrab’s. The four defendants charged on Wednesday are not in United States custody, prosecutors said. Mr. Zarrab has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, had no comment.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Climate Change Policy: Made in California,"A peculiar confluence of history, legal precedent and defiance has set the stage for a regulatory mutiny in California that would reverberate throughout the country. Central Los Angeles.CreditCreditMelissa Lyttle for The New York Times SACRAMENTO — The Trump administration may appear to control climate policy in Washington, but the nation’s most dynamic environmental regulator is here in California. Mary D. Nichols, California’s electric-car-driving, hoodie-wearing, 72-year-old air quality regulator, is pressing ahead with a far-reaching agenda of environmental and climate actions. She says she will not let the Trump administration stand in her way. As chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, Ms. Nichols is the de facto enforcer of the single biggest step the United States has taken to combat the effects of climate change: standards adopted under the Obama administration that mandate a deep cut in emissions from the 190 million passenger cars on America’s roads. Together, those vehicles regularly emit more earth-warming gases than the country’s power plants. At the request of the major automakers, the Environmental Protection Agency officially opened a review of those standards last month. The move was seen as the prelude to a loosening of those targets, which require manufacturers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and light trucks by 2025. But a peculiar confluence of history, legal precedent and regulatory defiance has given California unique authority to write its own air pollution rules. And because 12 other states now follow California’s standards, the state finds itself in an extraordinary position to stage a regulatory mutiny of sorts — with much of the country’s car market in tow. “We’re standing firm. We’re prepared to sue. We’re prepared to do what we need to do,” Ms. Nichols said in a recent interview. “We aren’t going anywhere.” At stake in the dispute between officials in Sacramento, the state capital, and Washington is a measure that the Obama administration estimated would eliminate as much as six billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and save consumers more than $1 trillion at the pump over the lifetime of the cars affected. For now, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the E.P.A., has said that he will not seek to revoke the federal waiver that allows California to set auto emissions standards — an action that would likely propel the issue to court. Automakers, similarly, have not publicly asked for such a move. Still, the auto industry has hardly conceded defeat, several industry officials said. The car companies are urging California to negotiate a loosening of the current standards. “We all have a common stake in working together,” said Mitch Bainwol, president and chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 12 major automakers in the United States. Automakers, he said, want “the certainty of achievable targets.” To understand why California has long blazed the trail for the rest of the country in air quality, gaze down from the hills above Turnbull Canyon at the Los Angeles haze. Ringed by mountains that act as a pollution trap for the fumes from the valley’s cars and factories, the Los Angeles-Long Beach area consistently ranks among the nation’s worst areas for ozone and particle pollution. But California’s smog was once much worse. For much of the 20th century, swaths of Southern California were hit with smog outbreaks that turned the skies so dark that locals once mistook a particularly intense episode for a solar eclipse. Crops wilted; school events were canceled; Hollywood studios shut down their outdoor shoots. The state moved quickly to regulate the obvious sources, like factory smoke stacks, steel mills and coal power plants. Yet the acrid smog persisted. “You couldn’t see the mountains around L.A. on smoggy days,” said John R. Balmes, a physician, air pollution expert and a member of CARB’s board, who has lived in the region for almost four decades. “People’s eyes would burn. They’d have headaches. They’d have problems breathing.” It took Arie J. Haagen-Smit, a Dutch biochemist at the California Institute of Technology, to link the smog to auto emissions. An avid gardener, he become alarmed in the late 1940s by the discolored leaves and flowers in his garden. He soon tracked down the culprit: the largely invisible exhaust from motor vehicles or factories was reacting with sunlight, forming ozone, or smog. Major automakers disputed the chemist’s findings. But a determined Dr. Haagen-Smit pressed his case, recreating smog in flasks to release at public hearings — proving, beyond a doubt, that cars were the source. That fervor elevated him to a job as the first chairman of the state’s air resources board, set up by then Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1967. When Congress established the E.P.A. in 1970 and passed the Clean Air Act later that year, California was granted a waiver to follow air pollution rules it had already established. In facing off with the auto industry, Ms. Nichols has harnessed a similar passion. At a March meeting of the CARB board — where she and her fellow board members resolved to push ahead with stricter emissions rules for cars and trucks, with or without the federal government — she stared down the auto industry representatives present. No matter that Ms. Nichols, a former environmental lawyer and Wall Street Journal reporter who is known to keep a grueling schedule shuttling between CARB’s Sacramento headquarters and her Los Angeles home, was nursing a cold and “could barely croak.” “What were you thinking when you threw yourselves upon the mercy of the Trump administration to try to solve your problems?” she scolded. “Let’s take action today, and let’s move on.” Ms. Nichols is on her second tour as chairwoman of the air resources board; the current California governor, Jerry Brown, appointed her in 1979, during his first stint in office. She was again tapped to head the board in 2007, when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger asked her to return. A clean-car evangelist, she is often seen driving around Los Angeles, where she lives, in her zero-emissions Honda Fit in “electric violet blue.” (She recently leased a second vehicle, a Toyota Mirai, a zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cell car, also in blue.) She initially lauded automakers for supporting an effort, started by President Obama in 2009, to harmonize a mishmash of greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards set by the E.P.A., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and CARB. Having taken almost $80 billion in bailout money, General Motors and Chrysler, especially, were in no position to resist. Still, the automakers soon balked at the ambitious pace of fuel efficiency improvements under the program, which requires automakers to progressively raise the fuel economy of their cars to an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, nearly double the average in 2012. That comes to about 36 miles per gallon in real-world driving. That aggressive target would compel automakers to speed the development of hybrid and electric cars, and to improve the fuel efficiency of their conventional fleets. Automakers also argued that meeting that target would be prohibitively costly, forcing them to raise car prices or to make more battery-powered vehicles than Americans want to buy. In a compromise, the automakers agreed to the program, provided that the standards for the later years — 2022-25 — would be subject to a midterm review. That review was in full swing when Mr. Trump won the presidency in late 2016. Just a day after his electoral victory, the Auto Alliance reached out to the president-elect, urging him to rework the standards, calling them a “substantial challenge” for the auto industry. In a similarly swift maneuver, the Obama administration cut short the review and finalized the rules, calling them “feasible, practical and appropriate,” just before leaving office. The automakers doubled down. In a Feb. 21 letter, the auto industry alliance implored Mr. Pruitt, the E.P.A. head, to overturn President Obama’s 11th-hour decision. The standards, the alliance argued, “threaten to depress an industry that can ill afford spiraling regulatory costs.” The E.P.A. has reversed President Obama’s decision. Last month, the agency officially called for comments on standards for model years 2021-25, widening the review’s scope. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which focuses mostly on auto safety, not emissions, is expected to lead the review. “We’re going to work on the CAFE standards so you can make cars in America again,” Mr. Trump said in a speech in Detroit this year, referring to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which were first put in place in 1975. For a meaningful reprieve, however, automakers need Ms. Nichols on board. If CARB does not sign onto the reopened review, the automakers face the prospect of separate rules for California and its follower states — a coalition that covers more than 130 million residents and more than a third of the vehicle market in the United States. Ms. Nichols is not budging. At the first public hearing on the reopened midterm review last week, CARB’s emissions compliance chief, Annette Hebert, threatened to abandon the review if the E.P.A. took steps to weaken the emissions standards. Should the agency try to curtail California’s ability to set its own rules — by challenging its Clean Air Act waiver, for example — the fight will more than likely end in court, said Kevin Poloncarz, a San Francisco lawyer focusing on air and climate change law. “Pulling that waiver would be like declaring an all-out war on California,” he said. Even in California, some critics challenge the expansive powers of a board of unelected officials with the authority to set environmental policy. All but two of the board’s 14 voting members are appointed by the governor, and today include a doctor, an almond farmer and a paint company executive. Over the years, CARB has expanded its reach, regulating products as diverse as lawn mowers and bulldozers, air fresheners, paint thinners and even hair and bug spray. It has sent inspectors to Tokyo and Stuttgart, Germany, to monitor the testing of cars manufactured overseas. And it oversees a system of air-quality management districts across California that issue and enforce their own local regulations. The agency is insulated even from state budgetary and legislative pressures. Its $956 million budget comes from user fees, like permits paid by polluters or the fees paid by car owners for smog certification, instead of from the state’s general fund. Accusations of overreach exploded in 2015, when Mr. Brown made a push to require a 50 percent reduction in petroleum use in motor vehicles by 2030, with CARB managing the reduction. Republicans and even some Democrats balked at the plan, and an oil industry campaign warned that the law would vastly expand CARB’s authority and could even lead to gas rationing. Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally. The governor eventually abandoned his push. He also signed legislation allowing the state Senate and Assembly to appoint one member each to the CARB board, enhancing lawmakers’ control over the agency. “What worries me is that they have unrestrained power,” said Mike Morrell, a Republican state senator who is one of CARB’s toughest critics. “They think they’re the masters of the universe.” CARB’s Arie Jan Haagen-Smit Laboratory in El Monte, Calif., is a reminder of the resources at the agency’s command. At the lab, 120 technicians measure emissions on new engines before they can be used in cars sold in California. They also pull cars from the road to make sure older models stay compliant. A failed test can delay certification, or in the case of an older model, an expensive recall. Engineers at the lab helped expose Volkswagen’s diesel emissions cheating, a scandal that affected about 600,000 cars in the United States. The lab is now strengthening its testing, and will move to a new state-of-the-art new facility in Riverside by 2020. Even as CARB remains steadfast, however, Ms. Nichols is eager to persuade automakers that they ultimately stand to benefit from stricter fuel economy rules. This year, Britain and France proposed to end the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2040. Volvo recently said that the models it introduces starting in 2019 will be either hybrids or powered solely by batteries. Without an aggressive shift toward zero- and low-emissions cars, the American auto industry risks becoming a global laggard, Ms. Nichols said. It is no time, she said, to be meddling with standards already in place. “We want to start conversations about post-2025,” Ms. Nichols said. “That’s what we’re getting ready for.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Desire for North Korea Oil Cutoff Puts China in a Tight Spot,"BEIJING — What the Chinese call the Friendship Pipeline runs for 20 miles, crossing under the Yalu River and spanning the border between North Korea and China. For more than half a century, it has been both a symbol of the two nations’ alliance and a lifeline for the North’s economy. Now, in response to North Korea’s latest and most powerful nuclear test, the Trump administration is expected to press China to impose an oil embargo on the North, cutting off the flow of petroleum through the pipeline and on tankers, too. The United States has called for similar measures before, and Beijing has almost always refused. But no previous American administration has pressed the case as an implicit choice between cutting off the fuel and potential military action. That puts President Xi Jinping of China in a particularly difficult position. With an important Communist Party leadership conference next month, he will not want to look weak in the face of American pressure. But a destabilizing war on the Korean Peninsula would be even less welcome. “Xi cannot afford to look like he is caving in under U.S. pressure,” said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “He needs something back from the U.S. to make the Chinese cooperation less costly to its image and geopolitical interests.” Mr. Zhang said that if Mr. Trump agreed to a version of a strategy proposed by China to ease the crisis — a freeze of the North’s nuclear program in exchange for suspending joint United States-South Korean military exercises — then Mr. Xi might be more amenable to an oil cutoff. But while Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have raised the possibility of a diplomatic resolution, Mr. Trump has expressed little interest in talking to the North. “Talking is not the answer,” the president recently said on Twitter. On Tuesday, a North Korean diplomat hinted that more nuclear or missile tests were in store, promising what he called “more gift packages” for the United States. The diplomat, Han Tae-song, said at a United Nations disarmament conference in Geneva that “pressures or sanctions will never work” on the North. China fears that putting too much pressure on North Korea could bring down the government of its leader, Kim Jong-un, perhaps resulting in large numbers of refugees crossing into China and leaving an American ally, South Korea, on its border. While Beijing often criticizes the North for its missile tests and nuclear detonations, it keeps the isolated country’s economy alive with exports of energy, mainly crude oil. China cut off oil supplies to North Korea for three days in 2003, after the North fired a missile into waters near Japan. The Chinese government told Pyongyang that the suspension was necessary for technical reasons, diplomats in Beijing said at the time. But that was a rare exception to China’s usual policy. While Mr. Xi has been willing to impose some minor restrictions on China’s energy supplies to North Korea, he has shown no signs of curbing the vital crude oil that keeps the North afloat. How much crude China sends through the Friendship Pipeline — which starts in Dandong, a trading hub in northeastern China, and travels under the Yalu River into North Korea — is not precisely known. China stopped reporting those figures several years ago. But given its recent economic growth, North Korea would be expected to import about 850,000 tons of crude oil this year, almost entirely from China, said Peter Hayes, the director of the Nautilus Institute, a think tank specializing in North Korean energy. Some other experts estimate a slightly lower amount — about 750,000 tons — for the year. Either figure would seem to reflect a substantial increase from a few years ago, though it is hard to be certain. In 2015, the China National Petroleum Corporation, which operates the pipeline to the North, said that the amount of oil sent through it had been kept at 520,000 tons. And China did report vastly reduced supplies of motor and aviation gasoline to North Korea in July — 92 percent less than the July 2016 value, according to the General Administration of Customs. Even if China did cut off crude oil supplies, North Korea — particularly its military — would be able to operate for a while, Mr. Hayes said. The military, which he said uses about a third of the country’s imported oil, has enough stockpiles for “a year of routine, nonwartime usage — could be more, doubt it would be less.” The military could fight for a month before running out of fuel, Mr. Hayes said. The brunt of a fuel cutoff would be felt by ordinary North Koreans, who would be “forced to walk or not move at all,” he said. “There will be less light in households due to less kerosene.” The North Korean government already uses charcoal to make fuel for vehicles, Mr. Hayes said, so a side effect of an oil embargo could be more deforestation in the countryside as trees are felled to produce charcoal. That could lead to further erosion, floods and the potential for famine. An embargo would also reduce the supply of diesel used by farmers to pump water for rice fields and to process crops into food, Mr. Hayes said. Cheng Xiaohe, a Korea analyst at Renmin University, said that a decision by China to cut off oil to the North would signal a willingness to tolerate instability around Mr. Kim’s government — a course that Mr. Cheng doubted the Chinese leader would take. “At the top, the North is not unified,” Mr. Cheng said. “There are factions.” The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid that sometimes reflects the thinking of the country’s leadership, said on Monday in an editorial that “we should avoid resorting to rash and extreme means by imposing a full embargo on North Korea.” A few months ago, the paper said an oil embargo was worth considering if North Korea detonated a sixth nuclear weapon, as it did on Sunday. The editorial said that cutting off crude oil would lead to a conflict between China and North Korea and still fail to halt the North’s nuclear weapons program. Besides the political considerations that China must weigh in considering an oil embargo, there are also practical concerns. China National Petroleum Corporation has said that stopping the flow of oil through the Friendship Pipeline might damage the pipeline. In 2011, engineers for the company wrote that wax in the crude oil could build up and block the pipe if the flow were stopped. They said it was safe to stop the flow for eight hours at most during summer, and for no more than two hours during winter. Mr. Hayes said that China was unlikely to agree to an oil cutoff, however strained its relationship with the North has become. “That would reduce whatever influence the Chinese have left in Pyongyang,” he said.",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Expands Kabul Security Zone, Digging In for Next Decade","KABUL, Afghanistan — Soon, American Embassy employees in Kabul will no longer need to take a Chinook helicopter ride to cross the street to a military base less than 100 yards outside the present Green Zone security district. Instead, the boundaries of the Green Zone will be redrawn to include that base, known as the Kabul City Compound, formerly the headquarters for American Special Operations forces in the capital. The zone is separated from the rest of the city by a network of police, military and private security checkpoints. The expansion is part of a huge public works project that over the next two years will reshape the center of this city of five million to bring nearly all Western embassies, major government ministries, and NATO and American military headquarters within the protected area. After 16 years of American presence in Kabul, it is a stark acknowledgment that even the city’s central districts have become too difficult to defend from Taliban bombings. But the capital project is also clearly taking place to protect another long-term American investment: Along with an increase in troops to a reported 15,000, from around 11,000 at the moment, the Trump administration’s new strategy for Afghanistan is likely to keep the military in place well into the 2020s, even by the most conservative estimates. No one wants to say when any final pullout will take place, because the emphasis now is on a conditions-based withdrawal — presumably meaning after the Afghan government can handle the war alone. But President Trump has kept secret the details of those conditions, and how they are defined. “Until he says what the conditions are, all that means is we’ll be there as long as we want, for whatever reason we want,” said Barnett Rubin, a longtime Afghanistan expert who advised the Obama administration. “And they don’t have to lie to do that, because the conditions will never be good enough to say we’re absolutely not needed.” In practical terms, it means that the American military mission will continue for many more years, despite its unpopularity with the American public. Many military strategists, in America and Afghanistan, have already penciled in plans well into the ’20s, and certainly past any Trump re-election campaign. At the NATO summit meeting in Warsaw last year, the allies, including the United States, agreed to fund the development of the Afghan security forces until the end of what was termed “the transition decade,” meaning from 2014, when Afghan forces began to take charge of their own security, until 2024. “I would guess the U.S. has to plan on being inside Afghanistan for a decade or more in order for there to be any type of resolution,” said Bill Roggio, editor of Long War Journal. “It’s definitely past his first term in office, no two ways about it.” The Green Zone expansion is aimed at making it possible for America and its NATO allies to remain in the capital without facing the risks that have in the past year made Kabul the most dangerous place in Afghanistan, with more people killed there than anywhere else in the country — mostly from suicide bombers. Kabul’s security area had long been a Green Zone-lite compared with its fortresslike predecessor in Baghdad, where there are massive blast walls and a total separation from the general population, enforced by biometric entry passes. In Kabul, thousands of Afghans still commute to jobs and even schools inside the zone, with only light searches for most of them, mindful of the resentment stirred by the Soviets’ heavily militarized central zone during their Afghan occupation. And the Green Zone in Baghdad has, its critics maintain, created an out-of-touch ruling class and Western community, and provided a magnet for protests while just moving enormous bombings elsewhere, further stoking popular discontent with leaders and foreigners. The Kabul Green Zone expansion, which will significantly restrict access, was prompted, according to both Afghan and American military officials, by a huge suicide bomb planted in a sewage truck that exploded at a gate of the current Green Zone on May 31, destroying most of the German Embassy and killing more than 150 people. The loss of life could have been far worse, but Germany had evacuated its embassy a week before the bombing, apparently tipped off by intelligence sources. The military recently appointed an American brigadier general to take charge of greatly expanding and fortifying the Green Zone. In the first stage of the project, expected to take from six months to a year, an expanded Green Zone will be created — covering about 1.86 square miles, up from 0.71 square miles — closing off streets within it to all but official traffic. Because that will also cut two major arteries through the city, in an area where traffic congestion is already rage-inducing for Afghan drivers, the plans call for building a ring road on the northern side of the Wazir Akbar Khan hill to carry traffic around the new Green Zone. In a final stage, a still bigger Blue Zone will be established, encompassing most of the city center, where severe restrictions on movement — especially by trucks — will be put in place. Already, height restriction barriers have been built over roads throughout Kabul to block trucks. Eventually, all trucks seeking to enter Kabul will be routed through a single portal, where they will be X-rayed and searched. The process of turning Kabul into a fortress started before Mr. Trump took office, of course — security measures were tightened and an obtrusive network of blast walls was established in some places years before President Barack Obama left office. Some of the plans for long-term American assistance in Afghanistan were already in place, too, and have been enhanced. An ambitious $6.5 billion program to build a serious Afghan Air Force is scheduled to take until 2023. In Brussels last October, the United States and other donor nations agreed to continue $15 billion in development funding for the country through 2020. Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump has suggested that American forces would remain in Afghanistan until victory. But even his own generals have conceded that a complete military victory in Afghanistan is not possible. The only solution most see is to persuade the Taliban to sit down to peace talks — something they have refused to do as long as American soldiers remain in the country. And with the insurgents gaining ground steadily in the past two years, the Taliban have even less incentive to negotiate. “It seems America is not yet ready to end the longest war in its history,” said the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, after Mr. Trump announced his new policy. “As Trump stated, ‘Americans are weary of the long war in Afghanistan.’ We shall cast further worry into them and force American officials to accept realities.” The Afghan ambassador to Washington, Hamdullah Mohib, said that talking about how much longer Americans may stay in Afghanistan obscures how different the years to come will be from the first 16 years. “I think a lot of the discussions when people talk about American presence in Afghanistan, the memory comes of when they were actively involved in combat and bodies were coming back to the United States. That is no longer the case,” Mr. Mohib said. “The majority of those soldiers are helping us improve our logistics, organizational capabilities, putting systems in place. While yes, there is an element of counterterrorism operations, it’s largely airstrikes supporting the Afghan special forces.” Despite the long-term scenario most military planners have embraced, there are still some dates that could disrupt the calendar. Next year, the country will hold elections for a new Parliament — three years late — but there are concerns that preparations for the elections will not be completed in time. An even greater concern is the following year, 2019, when presidential elections are due. The last presidential election, in 2014, was a fiasco, and amid accusations of fraud and vote-rigging, the outcome ended up in an American-negotiated deal to form a shaky coalition government. The United States may be willing to look past another tainted election, though the last one nearly devolved into factional conflict. Europe and the NATO allies, however, may be another matter; they have repeatedly insisted on clean and credible elections as a condition for continued support. “This may be our last golden opportunity,” said Haroun Mir, an Afghan political analyst. “If we cannot solve our problems by 2019, if we move to an ethnic conflict, this may spread to the Afghan security forces, and that would undermine the entire U.S. effort in Afghanistan.” He doubts the United States would stay if that happened. For now, though, the Americans and their allies seem ready to dig in. The Taliban have been fond of quoting an old Afghan saying: “You have the watches, we have the time.” After Mr. Trump announced his new strategy, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, used a televised speech to turn that expression on its head: “The Taliban should go buy a watch,” he said, because time was now on the government’s side.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. General in Afghanistan Apologizes for ‘Offensive’ Leaflet,"KABUL, Afghanistan — A senior American commander in Afghanistan apologized on Wednesday for a “highly offensive” leaflet that contained an image of a dog and the Taliban flag, which includes an Islamic verse. The Taliban said the leaflet showed what they said was the American forces’ hatred of Islam, adding that Taliban fighters had carried out a suicide attack near the entrance to the Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul, in revenge. Local officials said that attack wounded four Afghan civilians. The leaflet, distributed Tuesday by American forces in Parwan Province, north of Kabul, showed a section of the Taliban’s flag superimposed onto the side of a dog, an animal considered unclean by Muslims. The flag contains an Arabic passage from the Quran. “The design of the leaflets mistakenly contained an image highly offensive to both Muslims and the religion of Islam,” the American commander, Maj. Gen. James B. Linder, said in a statement. “I sincerely apologize,” said General Linder, the American Special Operations commander in Afghanistan. “We have the deepest respect for Islam and our Muslim partners worldwide.” He added that an investigation would be conducted “to determine the cause of this incident and to hold the responsible party accountable.” The leaflet was intended to encourage Afghans to turn against the Taliban and cooperate with Afghan and coalition forces. The governor of Parwan, Mohammad Asim, condemned the leaflet. “Those who have committed this unforgivable mistake in the publicity, propaganda or media section of the coalition forces will be tried and punished,” Mr. Asim said. The episode highlights one of the challenges facing international forces in Afghanistan, most of which are from non-Muslim cultures. Western forces have generally taken pains to avoid stoking sentiment against foreigners. The risk of a reaction against international forces has grown more pronounced with a rise in civilian casualties caused by increased airstrikes by American and Afghan aircraft since the beginning of the year. The Taliban, fighting to restore strict Islamic rule to Afghanistan and drive out foreign forces, issued a statement saying the leaflet made it clear “that this war is a war between Islam and unbelief.” In 2012, American commanders apologized after copies of the Quran and other religious texts were mistakenly burned at Bagram Air Base. That event set off large demonstrations in Kabul and other provinces in which several people were killed. On another occasion, a film of Marines urinating on dead Taliban fighters caused widespread offense, prompting an investigation and criminal charges. So-called information operations conducted by Afghan government and coalition forces have long been used to try to persuade Afghans to turn against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Above the picture of a lion and the dog, the latest leaflet contained an appeal to Afghans to report insurgents to the authorities. “Take back your freedom from the terrorist dogs and cooperate with coalition forces so they can target your enemy and eliminate them,” it said.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Governors at U.N. Assembly: ‘You Have Allies’ on Climate Change,"UNITED NATIONS — Jerry Brown, the governor of California, huddled on Sunday night with European, Brazilian and small-island leaders — gathered here for the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, which formally begins on Tuesday — and pledged to work with them on climate change. On Monday he met with António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, to discuss the future of the Paris agreement. In another era, meetings like these might have been the exclusive domain of the State Department. But with the Trump administration vowing to leave the Paris agreement on climate change — affirmed on Monday by Gary D. Cohn, the chief White House economic adviser, at a meeting with allied ministers — Democratic state governors are taking an increasingly conspicuous role on the international stage, forming something of an informal negotiating team. It is the first time that governors have taken such a prominent role on climate change at the annual General Assembly. Analysts said it would be the first real test of whether governors can persuade world leaders that efforts by American states might be able to take the place, at least in part, of federal government action. The goal, the governors say, is to assure other countries that they, along with and hundreds of cities and businesses, remain committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris accord. “You have allies in the United States. You shouldn’t put your foot on the brake or even tap it just because we have a climate denier in the White House. You’re not alone,” Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said he would tell world leaders this week. He rejected the idea that the governors represent a shadow diplomatic corps. “I don’t think it’s a shadow,” he said. “We’re in the sunlight. We’re shining the bright light of success.” The General Assembly brings together leaders and senior officials from nearly 200 countries for a week of speeches and high-level talks. Climate change — though not the central issue of the meeting — will have a high profile, in part because of confusion over whether the United States can be persuaded to remain in the Paris agreement. The White House has asserted that it will stay in the pact if “suitable terms” are met. It has not laid out what those terms might be. Mr. Cohn’s breakfast meeting on Monday with a handful of ministers to discuss climate change was the only event the White House has scheduled on the topic. Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally. “That’s why we have governors here. Because we don’t have someone from Washington D.C.,” Governor Brown said. “The states are picking up the baton.” Governor Brown, along with Governor Inslee and Gov. David Y. Ige of Hawaii, is also participating in Climate Week, a series of high-level panels on climate change. The Trump administration did not send a representative to the meetings, which are not affiliated with the United Nations. Governor Inslee will also meet with Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, which holds the presidency of United Nations climate change negotiations this year. Another governor, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, was expected to announce this week that his state would join California, 13 other states and Puerto Rico in the United States Climate Alliance, a group of states and territories that has pledged to uphold the Paris agreement. The addition of North Carolina to the group would be notable because it is among the highest-emitting states. Without big producers of greenhouse gasses, experts say, states will struggle to make significant gains in reaching global climate goals. As part of the Paris accord, the Obama administration vowed that United States greenhouse gas emissions would fall at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Each governor in the alliance is promoting individual policies aimed at meeting that goal. Oregon and New York, for instance, plan to shutter their last coal plants by 2020. In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe has ordered new carbon regulations for local power plants. California’s legislature has authorized one of the most sweeping climate programs in the world, aimed at decarbonizing every corner of the state’s economy, from transportation to agriculture. “We certainly believe if the federal government won’t lead in this area, we want the world to understand there are states across the country that are committed,” said Governor Ige, whose state enacted the first 100-percent-renewable energy standard. Terms like “500-year flood” and “100-year flood” are used as shorthand by government officials and actuaries, but they can confuse the public. Despite the push by the climate alliance, though, those states make up just one-third of the nation’s population, and the United States as a whole is still expected to fall short of Mr. Obama’s pledge. The big question, then, is whether the alliance can persuade other states to join its climate efforts. “Unless their leadership is met with followership, the impact will be pretty limited,” said David G. Victor, a professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego. “The idea has always been that if these states can demonstrate the technologies needed to cut emissions, that will help shift the politics in other states. But we have yet to see that play out.” Perhaps the governors’ biggest challenge will be the deep partisan divide over climate change in the country. Nicolas Loris, a research fellow in energy and environmental policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research groups, said he believed the governors were speaking for a minority of Americans. He said that more than half of American states opposed Mr. Obama’s signature effort to cut emissions, known as the Clean Power Plan. “It’s one thing if these governors are communicating their respective state climate plans, as ill-advised as they may be,” Mr. Loris said. “No matter how expensive or ineffective these climate policies may be, it’s their right. They can deliver that message to anyone they please. But they shouldn’t pretend their actions are the will of the federal government or the entire country.” For now the climate alliance is focused on the economic argument that it is possible to cut emissions without harming the economy. According to a recent report from the Brookings Institution, every state in the alliance has managed to cut emissions since 2000 even while expanding their overall economic output. The coalition states say they have created 1.3 million clean energy jobs while cutting emissions. “We have blown up the argument that acting on climate change is bad for your economy,” Governor Inslee said.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Open Results: Kevin Anderson Beats Sam Querrey to Reach Semifinals,"The towering Kevin Anderson took advantage of an even bigger opportunity, beating 17th-seeded Sam Querrey, 7-6(5), 6-7(9), 6-3, 7-6(7), in a quarterfinal match that began Tuesday night at the United States Open and ended at 1:51 a.m. Twenty-eighth-seeded Anderson will face 12th-seeded Pablo Carreño Busta in the semifinals on Friday. Carreño Busta, who beat 29th-seeded Diego Schwartzman, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2, in Tuesday’s first quarterfinal, has also reached the semifinals of a major for the first time. It’s a rare window of opportunity in an era of tennis dominated by the so-called Big Four: Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. “So used to the same guys being there, and they have had such unbelievable consistency,” Anderson said. “So obviously it gives us a bit of a chance that those guys, you see a couple of them in the other half, a couple of them unable to play this year. It allowed or gave some of the guys an opportunity to go deep into the tournament.” Born in Johannesburg, Anderson, 31, turned professional after playing for the University of Illinois. His only previous major quarterfinal had been at the U.S. Open two years ago. Because of rain, that match was relegated to Louis Armstrong Stadium, so Anderson had never before played in Arthur Ashe Stadium before Tuesday night. “That was one of my goals, just to try and further my previous best result,” Anderson said. “I was able to do that today, so that feels very good.” He showed no discomfort with the occasion. The 6-foot-8 Anderson hammered down 22 aces and won 82 percent of first serve points, just outpacing 6-foot-6 Querrey’s 20 aces and 81 percent of first serves won. There were only three breaks in the match — the two traded breaks midway through the second set, and Anderson broke Querrey in the sixth game of the third set. Neither one earned a break point in the first or fourth set. “He’s tough to play against — he’s so overly aggressive,” Querrey said. “A lot of his balls were landing in. It’s just tough. Like you said, just a couple points here and there. I thought he played really well in the big points.” The steady holds through most of the match gave way to wild momentum swings in the tiebreakers. Querrey led 5-2 in the first set tiebreaker before Anderson ran off with five consecutive points. In the second set, Querrey had a 6-1 lead in the tiebreaker before finally closing it out on his eighth set point at 11-9. In the fourth set, Querrey had a set point at 7-6 on Anderson’s serve, but Anderson saved it with a nine-shot rally. Despite being seen as a favorite to reach the final from a bottom half of the draw devoid of the game’s stalwarts, Querrey said he was “pretty happy” with his run to the quarterfinals, which was his best result in 11 appearances here, and the first quarterfinal appearance at the U.S. Open by an American man since 2011. “At the beginning of the week, if you said I would have made quarters, I probably would have signed up for that,” he said. “I know that bottom half of the draw was open, but you can’t say 63 guys blew an opportunity. Only one guy can go through, and Kevin’s pretty tough.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Open Results: Marin Cilic Loses; New Aunt Venus Williams Wins,"Stay here for live results and analysis from Day 5 of the U.S. Open. ■ Complete scores and schedule. The fifth-seeded Marin Cilic, the lone Grand Slam champion or finalist left in the bottom half of the men’s draw, lost, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-4, to 29th-seeded Diego Schwartzman of Argentina on Friday on Louis Armstrong Stadium. Cilic littered the court with misses, hitting 80 unforced errors. His backhand was especially rough, striking just one winner against 36 unforced errors. Cilic’s exit was preceded by the withdrawal of second-seeded Andy Murray and the losses of fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev and eighth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. That left the bottom half of the draw without any player in the top 14 in the rankings. Only one man remaining in the bottom half of the draw, 17th-seeded Sam Querrey, has even made a major semifinal before. The other seeded men are 12th-seeded Pablo Carreño Busta, 16th-seeded Lucas Pouille, 23rd-seeded Mischa Zverev, 28th-seeded Kevin Anderson and Schwartzman. There is also the qualifier Denis Shapovalov and the unseeded Paolo Lorenzi. One of these men will be in the U.S. Open final. Venus Williams reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open for the 15th time in 19 appearances, beating Maria Sakkari, 6-3, 6-4, in the final match of the day session on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Williams took the court just as news media reports began circulating that her sister Serena had given birth to her child in Florida. Venus Williams’s serve was not at its most potent, hitting no aces and eight double faults, but she returned tenaciously, winning half of the points on Sakkari’s serve. Williams has become a fixture deep into Grand Slam tournaments again, reaching the fourth round or better at nine of the last 10, after a period of struggles after she first announced her diagnosis of Sjogren’s syndrome. Williams will face Carla Suarez Navarro in the fourth round. Suarez Navarro beat Williams at the 2009 Australian Open, but Williams leads their head-to-head 4-3, including two wins at Wimbledon. Suarez Navarro will play Williams on her 29th birthday, Sept. 3. The last time she played a Williams sister on her birthday, in 2013, she lost, 6-0, 6-0, to Serena in 53 minutes. Read Juliet Macur’s column on Venus Williams here. Two players who have embarked on very different types of comebacks met at Louis Armstrong Stadium on Friday afternoon. Sloane Stephens, not all that far removed from an 11-month layoff because of a foot injury, and Ashleigh Barty, back on tour after an extended hiatus playing professional cricket, faced each other in a third-round match at the U.S. Open, where Stephens easily advanced with a 6-2, 6-4 victory. Stephens, a 24-year-old American who had surgery on her right foot in January, now appears to be playing some of the finest tennis of her career. After defeating 11th-seeded Dominika Cibulkova in the second round, Stephens needed just 1 hour 17 minutes to dispatch Barty, a 21-year-old Australian who committed 31 unforced errors. “I had a lot of opportunities, and it’s disappointing I couldn’t quite consolidate on a few,” Barty said. “But in saying that, she played great and probably deserved to win more than I did.” It has been a remarkable resurgence for Stephens, a former top-15 player who did not begin playing again until July. But after she had strong showing at the Rogers Cup in Toronto last month, where she defeated Petra Kvitova and Angelique Kerber en route to the semifinals, her world ranking jumped 783 spots. Her confidence seemed to balloon heading into the Open. Now ranked 83rd, Stephens will face 30th-seeded Julia Goerges in the fourth round. It will be Stephens’s first appearance in the fourth round at a Grand Slam event since the 2015 French Open, where she lost to Serena Williams, the eventual champion. — SCOTT CACCIOLA ■ Denis Shapovalov’s surprising run at his first U.S. Open continued as he advanced to the fourth round when his injured opponent, Kyle Edmund, retired from their match with Shapovalov leading 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 1-0. Shapovalov will face the 12th-seeded Pablo Carreño Busta on Sunday. Carreño Busta is the highest remaining seed in the bottom half of the draw. Read more about Shapovalov’s win here. ■ Maria Sharapova rolled into the fourth round of her first Grand Slam tournament since January 2016, defeating the 18-year-old American Sofia Kenin, 7-5, 6-2. Sharapova will play 16th-seeded Anastasija Sevastova on Sunday. ■ Borna Coric could not back up his upset of Alexander Zverev, losing in the third round to No. 28 seed Kevin Anderson, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. Anderson will play Paolo Lorenzi, who is in the fourth round of a Grand Slam event for the first time at age 35. ■ Sam Querrey, the No. 17 seed, defeated the qualifier Radu Albot, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the fourth round at the Open for only the third time in his career. He will face 23rd-seeded Mischa Zverev, who defeated No. 10 John Isner, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (5), on Friday night. Querrey, a Wimbledon semifinalist, is the last American man remaining in singles. ■ Garbiñe Muguruza, the reigning Wimbledon champion, has been demolishing her opponents at the U.S. Open. Through her first three matches of the tournament, including Friday’s third-round win against Magdalena Rybarikova, Muguruza has spent a total of 3 hours 9 minutes on court, losing only nine games without dropping a set. Her match against Rybarikova was a reprise of their semifinal meeting at Wimbledon, and the result was identical: a 6-1, 6-1 victory for Muguruza, seeded third here. (It took 61 minutes.) “My shots were there,” Muguruza said. With the win, Muguruza also knocked Venus Williams and Simona Halep out of contention in the race for the No. 1 ranking, winnowing the field from five to three. Along with Muguruza, Karolina Pliskova (the current No. 1) and Elina Svitolina (No. 4) are still in the running. Muguruza will face Petra Kvitova, the No. 13 seed, in the fourth round. ■ Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, easily advanced with a 6-0, 6-4 win against Carolina Garcia in the third round. Kvitova, the No. 13 seed and a quarterfinalist here in 2015, had lost her two most recent meetings with Garcia, the No. 18 seed. But Kvitova did not even face a break point on her serve as she rolled in the first match of the day on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Kvitova described the match as another step toward normalcy about eight months after she was attacked during a robbery at her home in the Czech Republic. She sustained tendon and nerve damage to her left hand and missed about five months. “Sometimes I do feel a little bit more normal than before,” Kvitova said, “especially on the court and around players and people, around the tennis, which I’m very grateful that I can be part of again. The life is still a little bit strange, but it’s getting better, as well. Hopefully one day it will be better.” — SCOTT CACCIOLA Paolo Lorenzi was meant to be a doctor. Instead of watching Saturday morning cartoons, his father, Marco, would show Paolo and his older brother Bruno preparatory videos of coming surgeries he was set to perform. When he was 18, Paolo Lorenzi, despite being an accomplished junior tennis player, went to the local university in Siena, Italy, to study medicine. Seventeen years later, he still pays token tuition annually to maintain his student status, even though he no longer believes he will ever practice medicine. “I have taken some exams, but now I think it is too late for me to be a doctor,” said Lorenzi after beating his countryman Thomas Fabbiano, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4, to reach his first round of 16 at the U.S. Open. “Now I think my career is as a tennis player.” At 35, Lorenzi is the oldest male player in the Open era to reach a major fourth round for the first time. He began his career going 0-13 in Grand Slam main draws; on 23 occasions, he has failed to advance past qualifying. But last year Lorenzi reached the third round here with a five-set win over Gilles Simon that lasted 4 hours 54 minutes. He lost in the next round to Andy Murray. Last summer he won his first ATP title, in Kitzbühel, Austria, and this past May he hit a career-high ranking of No. 33. Lorenzi credited his late surge to his coach, Claudio Galoppini, and his fitness trainer, Stefano Giovannini. “They really helped me learn to move better and improve my serve,” said Lorenzi, who will play 28th-seeded Kevin Anderson for a spot in the quarterfinals. He does not miss being a doctor. “There are enough surgeons in my family,” he says. “Besides, if I do become a doctor one day, I will be a sports medicine doctor.” — CINDY SHMERLER",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Open Results: Pablo Carreño Busta and Sloane Stephens Reach Semifinals,"This United States Open has been a tournament packed with opportunities for players like Sloane Stephens and Pablo Carreño Busta. With their paths through their draws drained of star power by injuries and upsets, they have capitalized on what they can control — by winning. On Tuesday afternoon, in back-to-back matches at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Stephens and Carreño Busta reached the semifinals at the United States Open for the first time. Stephens, an unseeded, 24-year-old American who has methodically worked her way back from foot surgery at the beginning of the year, survived in the women’s quarterfinals to advance past Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (4). On the men’s side, Carreño Busta became a first-time Grand Slam semifinalist with his 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Diego Schwartzman. “My head is a little clearer, if that makes any sense,” said Stephens, who entered the Open ranked just No. 83 but has won 13 of her last 15 matches over all. “Being injured gave me a whole new perspective on tennis and life and just in general. Now, I play tennis for a living and I enjoy it and have a great time, and I don’t think there’s anything I’d rather be doing.” Amid the relative anonymity of the bottom half of the men’s draw, Carreño Busta, a 26-year-old Spaniard, has quietly churned through the tournament without losing a set. At the same time, Carreño Busta, the No. 12 seed, is fully aware that he has benefited from some breaks. He faced four straight qualifiers to start the tournament, and Schwartzman, seeded 29th, injured his left leg in his fourth-round match. (At 5 feet 7 inches, Schwartzman was the shortest men’s player to appear in a Grand Slam quarterfinal since 1994.) “I know that I have a good draw here,” Carreño Busta said. “But when you have this draw, you have to do your best to take advantage.” Carreño Busta has not always been so fortunate. He recalled drawing Roger Federer in the first round when he made his Grand Slam debut, at the French Open in 2013. “The draw — sometimes you are lucky, sometimes you are unlucky,” Carreño Busta said. None of this is meant to diminish his achievement. In the fourth round, he faced Denis Shapovalov, the Canadian teenager whose ranking had climbed to No. 69 ahead of the Open but not soon enough for him to secure a spot in the main draw without having to go through qualifying. Carreño Busta required three tiebreakers to defeat Shapovalov. With this run, though, Carreño Busta has served notice that he is a long way from 2012, when he underwent surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back, and from 2013, when he tried to clamber his way up the rankings by winning seven straight events on the futures circuit, the lowest level of men’s professional tennis. On Friday, Carreño Busta will face Sam Querrey or Kevin Anderson in the semifinals. As for Stephens, she fought through a wayward forehand — and several pressure-filled moments — to advance to the women’s semifinals, where she will face Venus Williams or Petra Kvitova. In her only previous trip to a Grand Slam semifinal, at the Australian Open in 2013, Stephens had to defeat Serena Williams in three sets to get there. In this tournament, Stephens’s road has been slightly less arduous but no less satisfying. She beat No. 11-seeded Dominika Cibulkova in the second round and 30th-seeded Julia Görges in the fourth round before pushing past the 16th-seeded Sevastova. “This one feels good,” Stephens said. “I think I have a better perspective, just looking at the game totally different. Just happy with where I’m at and looking to build on it.” Stephens’s opponent faced her own adversity late in the first set. Already down a break and visibly frustrated, Sevastova called for a medical timeout so a trainer could work on her on right leg. But after dropping the first set, Sevastova fought back in the second. Her determination was no surprise. Sevastova, 27, retired from the sport in 2013 because of chronic back injuries and wound up missing nearly two years before returning to the tour. She now plays, she said, because she loves the sport and enjoys the stage. “I play for the spectators,” said Sevastova, who ousted Maria Sharapova from the tournament in the fourth round. “I play for everyone, for myself, to play these amazing matches. “Even if I would have lost against Maria the match before, I would be O.K. with myself. Because these two matches, they were unbelievable, some of the best matches of my career. This experience, I will never forget it.” Despite committing 41 unforced errors, Stephens was too potent in the match’s critical moments. She clinched the win with a backhand winner from the baseline. But before she left the grounds, Stephens had to surmount one last challenge: a fly that buzzed around her head at her news conference. She was not amused.“It’s a dragon!” she yelped before swatting at it with one of her sneakers. “I don’t like bugs.” An article on Wednesday about the United States Open misstated the score for the second set of Pablo Carreño Busta’s victory over Diego Schwartzman. Carreño Busta won 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. (The second set was not 7-4.)",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Open Shows One Road to the Top Goes Through College,"When four American women squared off in the semifinals of the United States Open, it signaled a resurgence of women’s tennis in this country. And Kevin Anderson’s appearance in the men’s singles final is giving a boost to college tennis. Anderson, 31, from South Africa, spent three years at the University of Illinois and turned professional 10 years ago. When he beat Pablo Carreño Busta in the semifinals on Friday, he became the first former college player to reach the U.S. Open final since Todd Martin of Northwestern in 1999. Stanford’s John McEnroe, in 1984, was the last former college player to win the Open. College is rarely seen as a direct path to the top in tennis, the way it is in football or basketball. But some see it as the right approach, even if players leave after one or two years to turn pro. “Look at Anderson,” McEnroe said. “He went to college and is in the finals of the U.S. Open. That should send a message to a lot of kids that are rushing it.” McEnroe also pointed to John Isner (University of Georgia) and Steve Johnson (University of Southern California) as examples of American players who improved their game at the collegiate level, matured, and were better prepared for the professional ranks. “It’s harder to do well in the pros at a young age now, so it makes total sense,” he said. Since 2014, a collegiate invitational featuring the 16 top college players has been held during the U.S. Open. In the men’s final Saturday, Tom Fawcett of Stanford defeated Michael Redlicki of Arkansas, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (6), 6-4. In the women’s event, Francesca Di Lorenzo of Ohio State came from 3-0 down in the third set to beat Ingrid Neel of Florida, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. No prize money is attached to the events, but there is a reward. The winners get a wild card into the qualifying draw or main draw of next year’s U.S. Open, depending on their rankings. That equates to a minimum of $8,000 for a first-round appearance in the qualifying rounds or $50,000 for a first-round appearance in the main draw. In 2006, Anderson won the N.C.A.A. doubles title for the Illini alongside Ryan Rowe. Likewise, Di Lorenzo, a sophomore, won the N.C.A.A. women’s doubles championship this year with Miho Kowase, and earned the No. 1 ranking in women’s college tennis. She was also named Ohio State’s female athlete of the year. Di Lorenzo lived in a dorm, even though her family is from just outside Columbus, and she said she loved the college experience. But having gone 74-7 in two years, she may be ready for the next challenge. She will play the Pro Circuit, a minor league of professional tennis, in the next month. Based on that experience, she will make a decision about whether to turn professional. Her father, Dr. Carlo Di Lorenzo, is a physician in Columbus. He watched his daughter’s victory in a red Ohio State jacket, then caught a plane back home a few hours later to see a Buckeyes football game. Being an Ohio State fan, he may be biased, but he said his daughter’s decision to go to the university was the right one. “Unless you are No. 15 or 20, it is the best thing to do,” he said. “The pro life can be tough. College gives you a chance to mature and develop the whole person.” Francesca Di Lorenzo noted how Nicole Gibbs, a former star at Stanford, had progressed this year, reaching the third round of the Australian Open and the second round of the U.S. Open. She saw Jennifer Brady of U.C.L.A. reach the fourth round at the Australian Open and the U.S. Open this year. “That gives us a lot of hope for all of us college players that one day we can be doing the same thing they are doing,” she said. After losing to No. 1 seed Karolina Pliskova in the fourth round of the U.S. Open, Brady said that if she had to make the decision again, she would go back to U.C.L.A. because it helped her develop, and not just as a tennis player. “I learned a lot on court and off court. I matured a lot,” she said. “I had to do things for myself. I had to take ownership of things off court.” She stayed two years at U.C.L.A. and turned pro. Neel, who played Di Lorenzo on Saturday, said that she decided to turn pro after one year at Florida. “It was great,” she said of her brief college experience. “It highlighted what I really wanted, and that’s to pursue tennis. I’m going to focus on being a pro athlete, and when I’m done, I’ll go back and pursue a degree of my choice.” McEnroe also left college after one year, but even that one season, he said, helped prepare him for the rigors of playing on center court against the likes of Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors. “It was one of the best decisions I ever made professionally, even if it was only one year,” he said. “When I was a junior, people were coming after me. I was the hunted instead of the hunter. Giving myself a year in college to get ready for the pro tour was really helpful for me. More kids should look at it.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Open: Del Potro Disrupts Federer-Nadal Meeting; Keys Rounds Out All-American Semifinals,"Stay here for live results and analysis from quarterfinals and semifinals of the U.S. Open. ■ Complete scores and schedule. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, two of the most prolific champions in men’s tennis history, have put together one of the greatest rivalries in the sport, as well. But one glaring hole has been that they have never faced one another at the United States Open. They will not this year, either. No. 24-seeded Juan Martín del Potro upset third-seeded Roger Federer, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4, in a riveting match in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Wednesday, stepping into what so many hoped would be Federer’s place opposite Nadal in one of Friday’s semifinals. Del Potro, the rangy 28-year-old from Argentina, remained steadfast in the face of Federer’s assaults on his backhand and numerous shifts in momentum. “I played my best match of the tournament,” del Potro said in an on-court interview with ESPN after the match. “I did everything well. I served so good and hit my forehand as hard as I can.” Federer wiped away a 0-3 deficit in the third set and then won the first three points in the tiebreaker. But del Potro saved four set points before he finally won that set with a mini break. In the fourth set, del Potro got an early break and held off Federer from there, finishing the victory with an emphatic forehand down the line. This is the second time del Potro has stood in the way of a Federer-Nadal matchup at the U.S. Open. He also did it in 2009 when he beat Nadal in a semifinal and Federer in a five-set final that ended with del Potro, then only 20, lying on his back in a combination of ecstasy and disbelief. There was some disbelief on Wednesday as well. He was asked in the postmatch interview how he had managed to come out on top in the taut third-set tiebreaker. “I think I got lucky,” del Potro said. “I made a double fault at 6-6 and you can’t do that against Federer.” Madison Keys brushed past Kaia Kanepi and completed a sweep. Keys, who won 6-3, 6-3 over Kanepi on Wednesday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, became the fourth American woman in the final four of this year’s United States Open, ensuring an American champion already. Sloane Stephens will face Venus Williams in the first of Thursday’s semifinals, and Keys will face CoCo Vandeweghe in the second. It is the first time the United States (or any country) has claimed all four semifinalists at a women’s Grand Slam event since Wimbledon in 1985, when Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Zina Garrison and Kathy Rinaldi were the last four. The last time it happened in New York was in 1981, when Navratilova, Evert, Tracy Austin and Barbara Potter reached the semifinals. It has been a stellar year for American women’s tennis, even with the country’s best player, Serena Williams, going on maternity leave after winning the Australian Open in January. Venus Williams made the finals of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Vandeweghe made her first major semifinal at the Australian Open. Keys successfully recovered from a second operation on her left wrist to win a tournament in Stanford, beating Vandeweghe in the final. Stephens has won 13 of her last 15 matches, reaching consecutive semifinals in Toronto, Cincinnati, and now New York. The United States team has also reached the Fed Cup final this year for the first time since 2010. They will play against Belarus in a November final in Minsk. Whoever wins the U.S. Open will be the first American woman aside from Serena Williams to win a Grand Slam since 2008, when Venus Williams won her seventh and most recent major title at Wimbledon. No Americans remain in the men’s tournament. Sam Querrey, the lone quarterfinalist, lost to Kevin Anderson on Tuesday night. There was much more suspense after the match than during the match on Wednesday as Rafael Nadal won his quarterfinal against Russian teenager Andrey Rublev, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 in just 1 hour 36 minutes. From a very early stage, it was clear that Rublev, a 19-year-old with a lightweight frame, did not have the requisite consistency and staying power to keep pace with Nadal, his childhood idol. Nadal broke Rublev’s serve seven times, won 92 total points to Rublev’s 53 and was very soon answering questions about whether he and Roger Federer will finally get to play at the United States Open. It is the only Grand Slam tournament where they have yet to face off. For it to finally transpire, Federer needs to defeat Juan Martin del Potro on Wednesday evening in the final men’s quarterfinal of the tournament. “It’s something a little bit strange that we never played here, because we played a lot of times in all the important events around the world,” Nadal said in an on-court interview. “Will be much more special if that can happen in a final, but it’s not possible this year. So we’re going to come back and try to make that happen.” With Federer 36 and Nadal 31, the future remains very uncertain, but if they do finally meet here in New York, it will be not only a duel for a place in the final but a duel for the No. 1 ranking, currently held by Nadal. It has been a throwback season from the start: Federer beat Nadal in a five-set classic to win the Australian Open in January. But Nadal, who did not have glittering hardcourt results this summer leading into the U.S. Open, has rarely had such a straightforward path to the semifinals in New York. He did not face a top 50 player in the first five rounds, and though he lost a set to Taro Daniel of Japan in the second round and to Leonardo Mayer of Argentina in the third round, he has now won nine straight sets and looks physically fresh, which has often not been the case at the U.S. Open during his long career. This will be his first U.S. Open semifinal since 2013, when he won his second singles title here. “Well of course this year has been an emotional year,” said the top-seeded Nadal. “I’ve been playing very well I think almost every tournament after some years with some problems in terms of injuries and sometimes without playing that well. So you appreciate it a lot when you come back and play a lot of matches in a row and you win matches and you fight for important titles.” Even though it was a singles match, there were two winners and one loser on Wednesday afternoon. CoCo Vandeweghe’s 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory over Karolina Pliskova not only put her into her first United States Open semifinal in singles. It also guaranteed that Garbine Muguruza will replace Pliskova as the world’s No. 1 women’s player on Monday. Muguruza, the reigning Wimbledon champion from Spain, will be the 24th woman to reach No. 1 since the rankings began in 1975, and she will be the fourth woman in little more than a year to occupy the top spot. It is a time of uncertainty in the women’s game, a time perhaps of transition with Serena Williams, long the dominant player and personality, now on maternity leave and aiming to come back next season. But even in Williams’s absence, the Americans are thriving like rarely before at this year’s U.S. Open. Three Americans have now reached the semifinals: Venus Williams, Sloane Stephens and Vandeweghe. A fourth may soon join them with Madison Keys set to face Kaia Kanepi of Estonia in the final quarterfinal on Wednesday night. “Let’s make it four for four,” Vandeweghe said, hands on her hips, in her post-match interview. It has been 36 years since four American women reached the semifinals at the U.S. Open. In 1981, Tracy Austin, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and Barbara Potter comprised the final four, with Austin going on to defeat Navratilova in a taut final, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-1). Tiebreakers have been the key to success for this generation of Americans as well. Venus Williams and Stephens, who will face each other on Thursday, both won their quarterfinals in third-set tiebreakers. And Vandeweghe took control of her quarterfinal with Pliskova by winning the opening-set tiebreaker after saving a set point earlier in the 10th game. It was an uneven match, full of big serves and unexpected errors under a closed roof in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Both women cracked rackets in frustration, but Vandeweghe has improved her ability to manage her emotions on big occasions this year. It has been a breakthrough season even if it has included pronounced dips in form and a coaching change: Craig Kardon resigned in the spring and has been replaced by the former Wimbledon men’s champion Pat Cash. But there is no quibbling with Vandeweghe’s results in the Grand Slam tournaments. She reached the semifinals of the Australian Open, the quarterfinals at Wimbledon and has now advanced to the semifinals here in the same place where she won the girls title at age 16. “It is a process,” said Vandeweghe, now 25, in her post-match interview. “I did expect it overnight when I was 16, but it is a process and now here I am and I couldn’t wish for anything better.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Plan for New Afghan Force Revives Fears of Militia Abuses,"News Analysis KABUL, Afghanistan — Around the time President Trump announced his new strategy for Afghanistan, a delegation of American and Afghan military officials arrived in New Delhi. They wanted to learn more about the Indian Territorial Army, which has been deployed in contentious areas to ease the burden on India’s regular army. The American military has turned to that force as a potential model for how to maintain the Afghan government’s waning control — without too high a cost — in difficult parts of Afghanistan at a time when the Taliban are resurgent. But diplomats and human rights groups worry that the proposal looks much like an older model — the Afghan Local Police, local militias who were trained and paid by the Americans but were accused of a long series of human violations, including abuse of civilians and sexual abuse of boys. The size of the new force is yet to be decided, but it could number more than 20,000, according to a senior Afghan official who was granted anonymity because the concept is still being discussed. The new local force would be under the command of the army, and recruits would go through similar training as regular soldiers. But the new force would serve primarily in local communities, holding areas cleared by the regular army, whose units would take on a primarily offensive role. Afghan officials said the new approach would in fact help rein in an unwieldy array of militias, rather than empower them to commit abuses. The idea surely appeals to American commanders, like Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. Military officers want to demonstrate progress to Mr. Trump, who said his “original instinct was to pull out.” He has ruled out a “hasty withdrawal” but insisted that there is no “blank check” for what has become the longest war in United States history. But in interviews, at least four Western officials briefed on the plan expressed doubts that the new force would be much different from the old Afghan Local Police militias, given the violent reality that districts are threatened by the Taliban. “It risks being turned into a dangerous shortcut,” one of them said. In a statement, Human Rights Watch, which has widely documented past abuses by Afghan militias, called on the Afghan government to reject the proposal for another force with inadequate training and oversight. “The Afghan government’s expansion of irregular forces could have enormously dangerous consequences for civilians,” said Patricia Gossman, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Instead of creating additional local forces, which are hard to control and prone to abuses, the Afghan government, with U.S. and NATO support, should be strengthening training and oversight to ensure that all forces respect the law.” Over 16 years, the United States has bankrolled a handful of militias, hoping that each of the latest would improve on the previous one’s history of abuses. The Afghan Local Police, or A.L.P., began in 2010 as a 10,000-strong force but now stands at more than 20,000 members. Despite significant training, American officials concluded that the force had brought about mixed results at best, with only one-third of the areas they patrol seeing improvements in security. Independent observers and human rights groups have often described the A.L.P. as a source of abuse, with little of the oversight in paper often materializing on the ground. The forces often have served as the extortion wings of local strongmen. The Afghan National Police was supposed to oversee the local police, but that rarely happened. The National Army has a better reputation for staying above the fray of often nasty local rivalries, but critics worry that drawing it into the same mess could undo hard-gained reforms made over the past year. Creating a new army force that holds territory after the national army has cleared areas is also seen as another step toward a military occupation of the territories, with rule of law and governance often taking a back step. “Placing the new militia under the army leadership, as opposed to the police-district governor oversight structure of the A.L.P., hopes to increase monitoring and control,” said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies Afghan security and governance. “However, since the Afghan Army suffers from leadership problems at the unit level, there is no guarantee that army will be significantly more capable of controlling the new militias than the previous police leadership managed with the A.L.P.” The senior Afghan official said the need for creating such force was born out of the experience of fighting largely on their own since 2014, with American troops reduced to a small advisory role. As districts have come under Taliban attack and the regular forces stretched, they have often turned to local militias to hold the district on the government’s behalf — and on its payroll. The new force will be cheaper than the national army, and more sustainable and accountable than the existing militias. The average army soldier now costs $12,000 to $15,000 a year, the most expensive in the region, the official said. Only 20 percent of that money is for salary; the rest goes to the logistics of his sustainment that could be much reduced in the new force. Capt. Bill Salvin of the United States Navy, a NATO spokesman in Afghanistan, said the mission would “closely monitor the development and implementation of these local forces.” “The most effective local security forces comprise locally recruited personnel, who are far more likely to be accepted by their communities, and if effectively led, could greatly enhance security and reduce abuses and corruption,” he said. While the senior Afghan official insisted that only the conceptual framework of the force had been agreed to, and that details were still being sorted out, several Western officials said that preparations were already underway to pilot the new force in southern districts of Nangarhar Province. The force will hold areas where the Afghan Army and United States special forces have driven out Islamic State militants. The last militia deployed in those districts was loyal to a strongman who is also a member of Parliament. Its members cut off the heads of several suspected Islamic State fighters and displayed them on pedestals built of rocks. “They will be recruiting from the same pool,” one Western official said, registering dismay. Atiqullah Amarkhel, a former Afghan Army general who served during the Communist era in the 1980s, said that young army officers might struggle to control such local forces, who rely on the support of powerful local patrons. He also warned that the American military should draw lessons from similar irregular forces tried by the communist government. “Our government collapsed because of these militia groups,” General Amarkhel said. “I have said several times to the current government — that they should learn from us and that they should not support thieves.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Says A.I.G. Is No Longer ‘Too Big to Fail’ 9 Years After Bailout,"WASHINGTON — A group of federal regulators voted Friday to no longer classify the American International Group as “too big to fail,” freeing the giant insurer from years of tough government oversight. The vote came nine years after the government rescued A.I.G. in a significant bailout at the height of the financial crisis, making the insurance company a symbol of the financial industry’s recklessness. Since nearly collapsing in September 2008, A.I.G. has sold off numerous business lines and significantly revamped its operations. It also repaid the $182 billion in bailout money it received from the government. In an effort to prevent a repeat of the crisis, the Dodd-Frank law of 2010 empowered regulators to designate certain nonbank financial institutions as “systemically important” and subject them to more intensive supervision. A.I.G. and other companies that received the label have fought to shed it, arguing that they aren’t big or interconnected enough to imperil the broader financial system if they run into problems. A.I.G. was one of four nonbank institutions classified as systemically important. Under Dodd-Frank, banks with more than $50 billion in assets are automatically subject to similar levels of heightened regulation. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, voted 6 to 3 to release A.I.G. from the designation. A two-thirds majority of the council’s voting members is required to remove the label. Among those supporting the change were Mr. Mnuchin and Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. Three regulators who were appointed by President Barack Obama voted against relieving A.I.G. of the systemically important designation. Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement that the removal of A.I.G.’s “too big to fail” label “demonstrates our commitment to act decisively to remove any designation if a company does not pose a threat to financial stability.” The government’s action is the latest step by the Trump administration to relax the oversight of major companies. President Trump and his advisers have argued that excessive regulation is stifling the economy, though critics argue that the broad regulatory rollback will set the stage for future problems. After Friday’s vote, Prudential Financial, an insurance company, is the only nonbank to carry the “systemically important” label. The financial arm of General Electric won the removal of the designation last summer after shedding billions of dollars in assets. The insurer MetLife won a case in Federal District Court last spring to have its “too-big-to-fail” label deleted. The Treasury Department under Mr. Obama appealed the MetLife ruling, and that case is still pending, although it has been postponed until the Treasury Department completes a report examining the designation process. That report is expected next month. Brian Duperreault, A.I.G.’s president and chief executive, said in a statement: “The council’s decision reflects the substantial and successful de-risking that A.I.G.’s employees have achieved since 2008.” In a statement, Prudential called on Friday for the government to “rescind our designation” as systemically important, saying the current situation creates “an unbalanced playing field.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Seeks Decades in Prison for Ex-Rikers Guard in Fatal Beating,"Federal prosecutors on Monday asked a judge to sentence a former correction officer on Rikers Island to nearly 30 years in prison for violating the civil rights of a seriously ill inmate who died after the officer assaulted him. The officer, Brian Coll, 48, kicked the inmate, Ronald Spear, repeatedly in the head while other officers held him face down on the floor, according to testimony and other evidence at the trial, which ended in December. Mr. Coll then lifted Mr. Spear’s head and leaned in close, one witness, a fellow correction officer, testified. “This is what you get,” the witness said Mr. Coll told Mr. Spear, using an expletive. “Remember I did this.” Mr. Spear’s death in December 2012 was seen as highlighting the culture of violence and the code of silence among guards that has long existed at Rikers. The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, which has made violence at Rikers a focus of its civil rights investigations and prosecutions, said Mr. Coll should receive a “significant” sentence that “approaches” the 30 years recommended by the court’s probation department, and is “well beyond” the roughly four to six years Mr. Coll’s lawyers have recommended. The jury found that Mr. Coll had deprived Mr. Spear of his constitutional right to be free from excessive force and that Mr. Coll’s actions had resulted in Mr. Spear’s death — for which he can face up to life in prison. “Coll’s conduct was brutal; it was violent, it was willful, and it was callous,” the office of Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney, wrote. Mr. Coll is to be sentenced on Wednesday by Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court. Mr. Spear, 52, was a pretrial detainee in an infirmary unit at Rikers when Mr. Coll assaulted him after they got into a dispute in December 2012. At the time, prosecutors have said, Mr. Spear had heart disease, diabetes and end-stage renal disease that required dialysis. He also used a cane and wore a bracelet that said he was at “risk of fall.” Prosecutors had said that Mr. Coll lied repeatedly after the assault, claiming Mr. Spear had attacked him with a cane, and persuading other officers to lie as well. Mr. Coll was also convicted of charges that included obstruction of justice and falsifying records. New York City paid $2.75 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Mr. Spear’s family. The city also ultimately settled a class-action lawsuit that had been brought by the United States attorney’s office, the Legal Aid Society and a private law firm; the settlement mandated systemwide reforms at Rikers. Mr. Coll’s lawyers, Sam A. Schmidt and Joshua L. Dratel, argued in their sentencing memo that Mr. Coll’s conduct was not “a premeditated, unprovoked assault, but was instead a spontaneous, albeit ultimately unlawful, reaction to a physical encounter initiated by Mr. Spear.” Mr. Coll, in a handwritten letter to the judge, said he felt “truly terrible about what happened that night and I was shocked and surprised that Mr. Spear lost his life.” His lawyers also argued that Mr. Coll had no history of abusing inmates and that the cover-up was not orchestrated by him “but was instead a function of the culture firmly in place at Rikers Island."" Prosecutors called that argument “meritless,” adding: “Coll lied in order to protect himself. That is not so much the product of a corrosive culture as it is the product of self-preservation and a casual disregard for the truth.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Seeks U.N. Consent to Interdict North Korean Ships,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday circulated a draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council that would effectively empower the United States Navy and Air Force to interdict North Korean ships at sea, inspect them to determine whether they are carrying weapons material or fuel into the country, and use “all necessary measures” to enforce compliance. The language is included in a remarkably broad draft that would ban the shipment of all crude oil, refined petroleum and natural gas to North Korea, essentially seeking to plunge a country of 25 million people into a deep freeze this winter if its leaders fail to begin giving up their nuclear weapon and missile programs. The resolution — circulated three days after the North conducted its largest nuclear test to date — would also seek to block all the assets of Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader, and virtually all the assets of the country’s military and its sole political party. The resolution, which the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, said this week she wanted to bring to a vote by next Monday, seems certain to meet vociferous objections from China and Russia. Both hold veto power at the Security Council. But if the sections authorizing interdictions at sea survive, it could set the stage for some of the tensest encounters on the high seas since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when President John F. Kennedy ordered a complete blockade around the island to prevent Soviet missiles from being installed. The resolution calls for something far less comprehensive than a total blockade, which is widely considered an act of war. But it would authorize a committee of the Security Council to “designate vessels for nonconsensual inspections” and authorize all members of the United Nations — using military vessels and aircraft — “to inspect on the high seas any vessel designated by the committee.” That could set up the conditions for a conflict at sea. If the crew of a North Korean ship failed to stop or resisted a boarding party, one senior military official acknowledged in recent days, the result could be an exchange of fire at a time when Pyongyang is threatening to use its nascent nuclear arsenal, and the United States is warning of a “devastating response.” President Trump spoke with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, from the White House on Wednesday morning, just hours before the United States sent its draft of the resolution to all 15 members of the Security Council. Both Mr. Xi and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, have opposed further sanctions, even after North Korea tested what it called a hydrogen bomb — experts have their doubts — on Sunday. “We should not act out of emotions and push North Korea into a dead end,” Mr. Putin said at a meeting in Vladivostok, according to dispatches from South Korean reporters. “We must act with calm and avoid steps that could raise tensions.” That sets up a confrontation at the Security Council pitting the United States, Britain and France against the other two permanent members. Mr. Trump appears to be using the resolution to highlight the contrast between the nations that support maximum sanctions pressure against the North and those seeking the status quo. The Trump administration on Wednesday repeated a drastic — if highly unlikely — warning if United Nations action is blocked. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told reporters aboard Air Force One during a flight from North Dakota that an executive order had been prepared that would authorize a halt in trade with “anybody that does trade with North Korea.” China is among dozens of nations that trade with the North. Even some Democrats have joined the Trump administration in calling for an oil cutoff, including Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. In an interview with CBS News on Wednesday, President Barack Obama’s former defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, said he supported “a strategy of coercive diplomacy” that would steadily increase pressure on the North if it continued to test its missiles and nuclear weapons, and would reduce sanctions if it complied with United Nations resolutions. Mr. Carter, now the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, said he considered it “in China’s interest” to “strangle North Korea,” but said he was not optimistic, “because China has consistently disappointed.” The fate of the Trump administration’s resolution may hinge in part on North Korean actions in the next few days. South Korea’s intelligence and defense agencies have said they see preparations for another missile test from the North’s main missile launch site on the northeast coast. There is some speculation that the test could be aimed at the waters off Guam, which Mr. Kim has said will be among his next targets. That has created a behind-the-scenes debate inside the Trump administration over how to respond — whether to consider a pre-emptive strike on the missile, try to intercept it with antiballistic missile batteries, or simply let the test proceed, especially if the missile appears headed for splashdown in international waters. Administration officials briefed members of Congress on the North Korean standoff on Wednesday, but they were vague about their plans, according to people who attended. Even if the United States managed to win approval of a complete ban on energy exports to the North, there is skepticism that it would be successful. Peter Hayes and David Von Hippel of the Nautilus Institute, experts on North Korea’s energy policies, argued in a paper this week that the country would adjust to an energy embargo. The country, they wrote, “could quickly cut its nonmilitary use by about 40 percent of its annual oil use,” substituting other fuels. “There will be little or no immediate impact on the Korean People’s Army’s nuclear or missile programs,” they added, and “little or no immediate impact on the K.P.A.’s routine or wartime ability to fight due to energy scarcity, given its short war strategy and likely stockpiling.” In a Skype conversation from Australia, Mr. Hayes said that “what worries me is that the American government may not understand that this will not work.”",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Slaps Duties on Canadian Jet, Raising Trade Tensions","OTTAWA — The United States announced Tuesday that it would impose duties on imports of a new jet made by the Canadian jet maker Bombardier, a decision likely to fuel trade tensions between the United States and Canada just as the two countries face off over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In response to a trade case filed by the American jet maker Boeing, the United States Commerce Department ruled that Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft, a smaller, regional aircraft that entered service last year, had received subsidies of 219.63 percent of the plane’s sales price, and it said it would begin collecting duties equivalent to that amount. That will more than triple the price of the new jet, chilling Bombardier’s future sales and potentially giving Boeing more space to expand into the market for smaller aircraft. “The U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules,” Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said in a statement. In a statement Tuesday evening, Bombardier said it strongly disagreed with the decision and called the magnitude of the duty “absurd.” The Commerce Department announcement, which centered on Boeing’s claim that the Canadian jet maker had received unfair government subsidies for its products, was the first in a series of rulings on the duties that are to be charged to Bombardier’s products, rulings that could be reversed in months to come. The next decision, on Oct. 5, will consider whether Bombardier sold its jets in the United States at an unfairly low price, a practice known as dumping. That could add an additional duty to imports of the jet. The United States International Trade Commission, a federal agency that monitors trade, will make a final ruling on the case early next year that could uphold or eliminate the duties. Yet federal customs officials are authorized to begin collecting the duties on Bombardier planes immediately. While the new jet has not yet been imported into the United States, the measure could damp future sales. Boeing greeted the news in a statement: “This dispute has nothing to do with limiting innovation or competition, which we welcome. Rather, it has everything to do with maintaining a level playing field.” The ruling was handed down as negotiators from Canada, the United States and Mexico met in Ottawa to negotiate reforms to Nafta, a sprawling trade pact that has guided the North American economy since 1994. In Canada, where trade supports much of the economy, and news of Nafta is splashed across newspapers and television channels, the talks are being viewed as a test of whether the government will stand up to President Trump’s aggressive stance on trade. In response to duties on Bombardier, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to abandon a planned purchase by Canada of military aircraft from Boeing. “We won’t do business with a company that’s busy trying to sue us and put our aerospace workers out of business,” Mr. Trudeau said on Sept. 18 in a joint news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Ms. May also criticized the Boeing case, arguing that it would cost jobs in Northern Ireland, where the wings for Bombardier’s CSeries jet are built. Jerry Dias, president of the Canadian labor union Unifor, said Tuesday that there was “no question” that President Trump’s election to office had ratcheted up trade tensions between the United States and Canada. “At some point or another, Canada is going to have to strike back in a very aggressive way. Just continuing to take it on the chin doesn’t make any sense,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the Nafta negotiations.",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Snatches Tie in Honduras, Saving World Cup Campaign","United States 1, Honduras 1 SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras — When the Honduran goalkeeper Luis López dove and punched Kellyn Acosta’s free kick up in the air in the 85th minute, Matt Besler used the outside of his foot — the only part that would have kept the ball in play — to flick it back across the goal mouth. Jordan Morris, the most industrious player for the United States men’s national team on a scorching Tuesday afternoon here, jumped in next to keep the play alive, leaping to head it toward a thicket of Honduran defenders. The ball proceeded to fall fortuitously to the feet of Bobby Wood. Amid the scramble, Wood, who had come on as a late substitute, did not allow the gravity of his circumstance — the late moment, the team’s dire standing in World Cup qualifying — cloud his head. He maintained only a single thought. “Just finish the play,” Wood said. “Pretty simple.” Wood’s opportunistic goal off a mad scramble not only rescued an unlikely point for the United States in a 1-1 tie with Honduras, it may have also rescued their World Cup hopes. By virtue of the draw, the Americans remain in control of their own fate in qualifying in the Concacaf region. But it is a narrow path: Anything other than a victory over Panama in its next match, Oct. 6 in Orlando, Fla., could leave the United States needing help. The U.S. players indeed looked in need of help near the end of an exhausting afternoon, playing under 91-degree heat and stifling humidity, in which the home team — with World Cup designs of its own — was urged on by a fervent crowd that packed Estadio Olimpico on what had been declared a national holiday. Romell Quioto’s 27th-minute goal, which came after he burst past the back line to receive a through pass before kissing a shot off the post and into the net, sent the crowd into delirium. As the Americans pressed in the second half, sending greater numbers forward, they survived several chances by Honduras that would have sealed the outcome. In the waning moments, though, the Americans summoned their resolve. “This is what qualifying is all about,” said Michael Bradley, the U.S. midfielder and captain. “There are so many days when it’s not pretty. Honestly, in a lot of moments, it has nothing to do with football. It’s about finding a way to survive and dealing with everything that gets thrown at you, having a group that can hold up in the toughest moments.” The United States salvaged a tie, leaving it with 9 points — the same as Honduras, although the Americans have the tiebreaker in goal differential, and 1 point behind Panama, which defeated Trinidad and Tobago late Tuesday night. The Americans are still in a precarious position in their bid to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The fourth-place finisher in Concacaf proceeds to a two-leg playoff against a team from the Asian confederation to reach the World Cup. The United States has not been in such a spot in qualifying since 1989, when it had to win at Trinidad and Tobago in its final qualifying match to claim its berth in the World Cup in Italy a year later. That started a run of consecutive World Cup appearances that only a handful of countries — Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain and Korea — can match. The United States, as it has grown as a soccer country, has done so in the forgiving Concacaf region, which it has mostly dominated along with Mexico over the last 25 years. While countries like England, France and the Netherlands have missed out on qualifying, the United States has eased through qualifying mostly unharried. But the way the United States has played of late — losing by 2-0 at home to Costa Rica on Friday and then escaping with a point on Tuesday — seemed to knock any hubris right out of Coach Bruce Arena. “The door for Russia is not even cracked open right now,” Arena said, holding his thumb and forefinger together for effect. “There’s a lot of work to be done to get to Russia.” Some of it was done Tuesday. When the United States retreated to the locker room at halftime, Arena told his players he did not like their body language after Quioto’s goal, that they appeared to have dropped their heads. Arena had overhauled the starting lineup, changing seven players and leaning heavily on players based in Major League Soccer, who he said were in better shape at this point in the soccer calendar than European-based players, whose seasons were just beginning. While none of the changes had the desired result, Arena took a chance with about 30 minutes left in the second half, removing his two outside defenders — Graham Zusi and DaMarcus Beasley, who had been repeatedly overrun by Quioto and Alberth Elis on the flanks. Arena shifted to a three-man back line, with Geoff Cameron coming on to join Omar Gonzalez and Besler. In the 73rd minute, he sent on Wood — a forward who started in Friday’s loss to Costa Rica — to replace midfielder Darlington Nagbe. When asked what he wanted out of Wood, Arena said: “To score a goal.” Wood concurred: “That’s my job. Coming in as a sub you always want to change the game some way. I want to help the team as much as possible.” As the United States steadily pushed more players forward — with the substitute Paul Arriola on the wing and Bradley in the middle — it still managed few good chances. As the clock reached 75 minutes and then 80, the players on the field said they did not consider what might happen if they did not score a goal. But the thought did go through the mind of their coach. “I was thinking,” Arena said, “we might have an early vacation at the end of the year.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Students in Florence Accuse Police Officers of Rape,"ROME — The Italian authorities are investigating accusations by two American women studying abroad in Florence that they were raped on Thursday by two uniformed members of Italy’s Carabinieri police force, and Italy’s defense minister said there appeared to be “some basis” to the allegations. The accusations have generated considerable coverage in the country’s news media and have shaken Florence’s large community of people involved in study-abroad programs. “Rape is always a serious matter,” Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti said Friday at a conference on women’s issues. “But it’s of unprecedented seriousness if it is committed by Carabinieri in uniform.” The Carabinieri is a paramilitary police force that operates under the control of the Defense Ministry. The two women — 19 and 21, according to local news media reports — have accused the two police officers of raping them in the entrance and elevator of their apartment building in the center of Florence before dawn on Thursday. The officers, who are reportedly in their 30s, have denied the allegations, and they have not been charged. The officers had responded to a call at a club, Flo, where a brawl had broken out and apparently met the women there, according to Italian officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the investigation. The Florence police said the club’s cameras showed the women leaving with two officers. The women told prosecutors that they were intoxicated and had smoked marijuana that evening, according to Italian news media reports, and that the officers accompanied them to their apartment in a service vehicle. The women live in Borgo Santi Apostoli, in the historic center of the city. Prosecutors in Florence are investigating the accusations and have taken statements from the two women, who, according to Italian news media reports, are from New Jersey and Maine, and are studying at Lorenzo de’ Medici – The Italian International Institute. The Italian authorities have collected potential evidence, including the women’s clothes, and the women underwent medical examinations and DNA tests at a Florence hospital. Florence is Italy’s center for study-abroad programs and is a popular destination for American students. Many leading American universities operate programs in the city and house students in villas there. The explosive allegations have dominated news coverage throughout Italy, with articles about them at the top of the country’s newspapers and news websites. On Saturday, the website of Italy’s largest newspaper, Corriere della Sera, featured a video with illustrations depicting the night’s events set to haunting piano music. “If this is true, and I hope that light is shed on the matter as soon as possible, then it would be an act of unheard-of gravity,” Gen. Tullio Del Sette, the commander of the Carabinieri, told the ANSA news agency.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Stumbles in Qualifying on Night Mexico Clinches Place in World Cup,"Costa Rica 2, United States 0 HARRISON, N.J. — If a sense of inevitability about qualifying for next year’s World Cup had begun to take hold for the United States national team under Bruce Arena, a feeling that he had reset the team’s course since replacing the team’s previous coach, Jurgen Klinsmann, that aura vanished Friday night. Costa Rica, playing with poise and a strong opportunistic streak, got two goals from Marco Ureña and some highlight-reel saves from goalkeeper Keylor Navas to defeat the United States, 2-0, before a capacity crowd at Red Bull Arena. The loss doesn’t necessarily put the United States World Cup campaign in a precarious position; the U.S. is done with Costa Rica and Mexico, the two toughest opponents in its final-round group in regional qualifying, and the Americans still have their fate in their hands. But the defeat will raise the temperature for the their final three qualifying matches. The United States is tied for third place with Honduras in its six-team group, 6 points behind Costa Rica and 9 behind Mexico (which qualified for next summer’s World Cup in Russia by defeating Panama, 1-0, late Friday). But only the top three teams advance directly to the World Cup, and now one of those spots has been claimed. The upside for the Americans is that they will close against the bottom three teams — at Honduras on Tuesday, and then home to Panama and at Trinidad and Tobago in October. “This is our reality at the moment,” said midfielder Michael Bradley, the American captain. “The likelihood is that it’s going to go down to the wire, and that can’t faze anybody. That can’t scare us. “Costa Rica and Mexico are gone. Us and Panama and Honduras play a few games and at the end. One will go to the World Cup, one will go to a playoff and one will be out.” One of the big questions entering the match was how the United States defense would hold up without the injured center back John Brooks, who is out for three months. Friday’s one-match answer was definitive: not well. One central defender, Tim Ream, was beaten by Ureña on the first Costa Rican goal, and a bad pass by his partner, Geoff Cameron, started the sequence for the second goal by Ureña that finished off the Americans in the 82nd minute. Arena called the errant pass from Cameron “a bad mistake,” but all it did was finish off the game. It was the first goal that inexorably changed it. It came in the 30th minute, when the ball landed at the feet of Bryan Ruiz — after the United States players nearby protested that he had handled it. Turning quickly, Ruiz released a pass that settled to the feet of Ureña, who had sprinted through a yawning gap between Ream and Cameron. Ureña took a small touch toward his right, then another and another — keeping Ream at bay — before calmly sliding a shot back across the face of the goal and inside goalkeeper Tim Howard’s back post. “We got split there with our center backs, which shouldn’t happen,” Arena said. Finding itself in an early hole was problematic for Arena’s team. The Ticos rode their defensive 5-4-1 formation and the brilliance of Navas to the quarterfinals of the 2014 World Cup, where they knocked out by the Netherlands on penalty kicks. Once Costa Rica gets a lead, it has the cohesiveness and the savvy to ride it to the finish line. “They’re set up to close down space, to make things difficult,” Bradley said. “It requires patience. It requires the right timing. It requires being sharp.” He added: “I think at times we put together some good play, but we couldn’t get the final part of the play right. In other moments, it was a little too slow, a little too predictable.” The Americans’ plan was to play through Christian Pulisic, the 18-year-old who has flourished since making his national team debut late last year. But Pulisic grew increasingly frustrated Friday — not just at the attention of two defenders seemingly every time he touched the ball, or over a handful of scything tackles, but also because of a number of poor touches that turned into wasted opportunities. “He had a tough game today and obviously they paid a lot of attention to him,” Arena said of Pulisic, who declined to speak to reporters. “You could see early in the game, they always sent a second player to him. I think he got a little frustrated.” Searching for a spark, Arena turned to Clint Dempsey in the 65th minute. The stadium came alive when Dempsey put on his jersey, poured water over his head and shook hands with Arena before replacing left back Jorge Villafaña. But Dempsey, a former captain who most recently has taken on the role of super sub, could do little to change the game. That role went to Navas, who parlayed his 2014 World Cup performance into a transfer to Real Madrid. He made a spectacular save midway through the second half, leaping to his left for Pulisic’s left-footed shot and then reaching back with his right leg to stop the ball after it had been deflected. It was one of 14 shots by the United States, but also one of only two that were on goal. The other came in the 81st minute, when Navas smothered an attempt from Jozy Altidore after he had bulled his way through two defenders. A moment later, Cameron’s errant pass out of the back went straight to the feet of midfielder David Guzman, who pushed it back to spring Ureña, splitting the defense again. He slid the ball against past a helpless Howard, and the Ticos’ victory was secure. Their trip to Russia next summer is all but assured, but for the other team at Red Bull Arena, there is still work to be done.",The New York Times
2017,U.S. Tells 21 States That Hackers Targeted Their Voting Systems,"WASHINGTON — The federal government on Friday told election officials in 21 states that hackers targeted their systems before last year’s presidential election. The notification came roughly a year after officials with the United States Department of Homeland Security first said states were targeted by hacking efforts possibly connected to Russia. The states that told The Associated Press they had been targeted included some key political battlegrounds, such as Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. The A.P. contacted every state election office to determine which ones had been informed that their election systems had been targeted. The others that confirmed they were targeted were Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Washington. Being targeted does not mean that sensitive voter data was manipulated or that results were changed. A hacker targeting a system without getting inside is similar to a burglar circling a house, checking for unlocked doors and windows. Even so, the widespread nature of the attempts and the yearlong lag time in notification from the Department of Homeland Security raised concerns among some election officials and lawmakers. For many states, the calls on Friday were the first official confirmation that they were on the list — even though state election officials across the country have been calling for months for the federal government to share information about any hacks, as have members of Congress. “It is completely unacceptable that it has taken D.H.S. over a year to inform our office of Russian scanning of our systems, despite our repeated requests for information,” California’s secretary of state, Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said in a statement. “The practice of withholding critical information from elections officials is a detriment to the security of our elections and our democracy.” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on a committee that is investigating Russian meddling in last year’s election, has been pushing the department for months to reveal the identities of the targeted states. He said states need such information in real time so that they can strengthen their cyber defenses. “We have to do better in the future,” he said. The Department of Homeland Security said it recognized that state and local officials should be kept informed about cybersecurity risks to election infrastructure. “We are working with them to refine our processes for sharing this information while protecting the integrity of investigations and the confidentiality of system owners,” the department said in a statement. The government did not say who was behind the hacking attempts or provide details about what had been sought. But election officials in several states said the attempts were linked to Russia. The Wisconsin Election Commission, for example, said the state’s systems were targeted by “Russian government cyber actors.” Josie Bahnke, Alaska’s elections division director, said computers in Russia were scanning election systems looking for vulnerabilities. A spokeswoman for the National Association of Secretaries of State said the group had requested a list of the states where there were hacking efforts. In most cases, states said they were told the systems were not breached. Federal officials said that in most of the 21 states the targeting was preparatory activity such as scanning computer systems. The targets included voter registration systems but not vote-tallying software. Officials said there were some attempts to compromise networks, but most were unsuccessful. Only Illinois reported that hackers had succeeded in breaching its voter systems. Other states said their cybersecurity measures turned back efforts to get to crucial information. “There are constant attempts by bad actors to hack our systems,” Iowa’s secretary of state, Paul Pate, a Republican, said in a statement. “But we continue to deflect those attempts.” Colorado said the hacking did not quite amount to a breach. “It’s really reconnaissance by a bad guy to try and figure out how we would break into your computer,” said Trevor Timmons, a spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state’s office. “It’s not an attack. I wouldn’t call it a probe. It’s not a breach, it’s not a penetration.” Earlier this year, a leaked National Security Agency report detailed that hackers obtained information from a company that provided software to manage voter registrations in eight states. The May report said hackers sent phishing emails to 122 local election officials just before the November 2016 election in an attempt to break into their systems. The latest disclosure to the states comes as a special counsel investigates whether there was any coordination during the 2016 presidential campaign between Russia and associates of President Trump. Mr. Trump, a Republican who defeated Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, in the presidential election, has called the Russia story a hoax. He says President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has “vehemently denied” the conclusions of numerous American intelligence agencies. For states that were told they were not targets, the news brought relief. “This is one time we like being at the bottom of the list,” said Lisa Strimple, a spokeswoman for Nebraska’s secretary of state.",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. Urges Fuel Cutoff for North Korea, Saying It’s ‘Begging for War’","WASHINGTON — The Trump Administration, warning that North Korea is “begging for war,” is pressing China and other members of the United Nations Security Council to cut off all oil and other fuels to the country. The effort, which senior administration officials described as a last best chance to resolve the standoff with the North using sanctions rather than military means, came as South Korean officials said Monday that they had seen evidence that North Korea may be preparing another test, likely of an intercontinental ballistic missile. That test, which would be the nation’s third in a month, could be timed to mark the anniversary of the founding of North Korea by Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of the current leader. It is unclear where the test might be aimed, but Pentagon officials said they were examining options in case it was meant to demonstrate that the North could put a missile, with accuracy, off the coast of Guam, an American territory. The call for the fuel cutoff, which is expected to be part of a draft resolution that the United States is beginning to discuss privately with other members of the Security Council, came a day after North Korea’s most powerful nuclear test in the 11 years it has been detonating nuclear weapons. It is far from clear that China’s president, Xi Jinping, would be willing to go along with the highly aggressive step of cutting off fuel to the North. Roughly 90 percent of North Korea’s trade, and nearly all of its imported energy supplies, come from China. China’s overall trade with the North was up significantly in the past 12 months, and it has long feared that an oil cutoff would lead to the collapse of the regime. That, in China’s eyes, would only invite South Korea to take over the North, and put an American ally on China’s border. The subject of fuel cutoff is likely to come up in a phone call with President Xi that the White House was trying to arrange. Speaking to the Security Council in an emergency session on Monday, Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, “is begging for war.” Six systems that North Korea needs to master to achieve a long-sought goal: being able to reliably hit the United States. “We have kicked the can down the road long enough,” Ms. Haley told the council in an emergency meeting. “There is no more road left.” Ms. Haley did not threaten unilateral military action by Washington or repeat the president’s statement on Twitter that South Korea’s effort to engage the North directly was a form of “appeasement.” She said instead that “the time has come for us to exhaust all of our diplomatic means before it’s too late.” Even as Ms. Haley called for more diplomacy, Mr. Trump agreed in a phone call on Monday evening with South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, to allow South Korea to build more powerful non-nuclear ballistic missiles, said Park Soo-hyun, a spokesman for Mr. Moon. While the South has pressed for such permission for many years, the change is unlikely to alter the strategic balance on the Korean Peninsula. “President Trump reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to defend South Korea,” Mr. Park said. “The two leaders also agreed to push for maximum pressure and sanctions against North Korea.” Inside the White House, there is little expectation that the drive to cut off North Korea’s fuel — which echoes the energy embargo that the United States used to try to force Japan to change its behavior in 1941, before the attack on Pearl Harbor — will work because of the Chinese reluctance to take that step. Nonetheless, fuel-related sanctions are the focus of the Trump administration’s latest efforts at the Security Council, according to the senior American officials. Ms. Haley’s comments on Monday were notable in part because while they called for a last stab at diplomacy, they also ruled out the one diplomatic option considered the most viable first step — a Chinese and Russian proposal for a “freeze” on the North’s nuclear and missile testing in return for some kind of freeze on United States military exercises. She said that at a time that the North was threatening the United States, it would be unwise to trim back training with allies. “There are some good reasons for not doing a freeze-for-freeze,” said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a former senior diplomat in both Bush administrations. “But that doesn’t mean no freeze for something. The U.S. has not put forward our own options, what we would be prepared to sign up for. There’s a diplomatic vacuum.” As Mr. Trump considered his options, however, he is also confronting the implications of some of his own rhetoric. He declared that North Korea would not be permitted to fire I.C.B.M.’s — “It won’t happen!” he tweeted on Jan. 2 — and they were fired. He said the United States would bring “fire and fury” to the North if it was threatened, and Sunday’s nuclear test, claimed by the North to be a hydrogen bomb, was accompanied by North Korea’s announcement that the weapon could be fitted on a missile that could reach the United States. In short, Mr. Trump has run the risk of doing what he charged President Barack Obama with doing in Syria: drawing a line and not enforcing it. His senior aides say that it is too early to make that judgment, and that a combination of crushing economic pressure and stepped-up military patrols, missile defenses and practice bombing runs may eventually change Kim Jong-un’s behavior. The president’s only declared line, they argue, is that he will never allow the United States to be under the threat of a nuclear attack by the North. So far, intelligence agencies have stopped short of formally assessing that the North has all the elements it needs to reach the United States with a weapon. But if it is missing some elements – including the ability to protect a warhead from burning up during the stresses of re-entering the atmosphere – it seems likely to achieve them soon. Monday’s meeting of the Security Council was the second time in less than a week that the most powerful body of the United Nations had met to discuss North Korea, and the tenth time it has done so this year. Last month, the council tightened sanctions against North Korea, unanimously adopting a resolution that Ms. Haley called “the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation.” But since then, North Korea carried out one of its most provocative missile tests in recent years, hurling a ballistic missile directly over Japan that prompted the government in Tokyo to warn residents in its path to take cover. And Sunday’s test was the most powerful yet, with a blast that experts said was far more destructive than the bombs that the United States dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. In her remarks, Ms. Haley gave a lengthy summary of the North’s flouting of international law since 1993, when the United Nations urged the country to reconsider its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The North’s moves the following year triggered a crisis similar to today’s, and was the closest the United States and North Korea have come to resuming the Korean War. “Despite our efforts over the past 24 years, the North Korean nuclear program is more advanced and more dangerous than ever,” she said. “They now fire missiles over Japanese airspace.” “They now have I.C.B.M. capabilities,” she said, referring to intercontinental ballistic missiles. “They now claim to have tested a hydrogen bomb. And just this morning there are reports that the regime is preparing for yet another I.C.B.M. launch.” “We have taken an incremental approach,” Ms. Haley added, “and despite the best of intentions, it has not worked.” François Delattre, the French ambassador, also called for new sanctions. “It is no longer a regional threat, it is a global threat,” he said. “It is no longer a virtual threat, it is an imminent threat. It is no longer a serious threat, it is an existential threat.” While Japan and South Korea joined the condemnations, there are clear tensions. Mr. Trump’s jab at the South on Sunday that it was practicing “appeasement” generated headlines in Seoul, as did Mr. Trump’s threat to scrap a free trade agreement with South Korea, one that was signed in part to demonstrate strategic unity. There are clear divisions in South Korea about how to deter the North. Testifying before the National Assembly on Monday, Defense Minister Song Young-moo of South Korea said he had told his American counterpart, Jim Mattis, in a meeting last week that the United States needed to send long-range bombers, aircraft carriers and other strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula more often or regularly to reassure the South Koreans. He said he had told Mr. Mattis that many in his country were calling for the reintroduction of American tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea. He did not disclose how Mr. Mattis responded. Those weapons were removed from the South by the United States more than 25 years ago. Mr. Moon’s office said his government remained opposed to the reintroduction of American tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea, saying that doing so would make it more difficult to persuade North Korea to give up its own nuclear weapons.",The New York Times
2017,"U.S. in Direct Communication With North Korea, Says Tillerson","BEIJING — The Trump administration acknowledged on Saturday for the first time that it was in direct communication with the government of North Korea over its missile and nuclear tests, seeking a possible way forward beyond the escalating threats of a military confrontation from both sides. “We are probing, so stay tuned,” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said, when pressed about how he might begin a conversation with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, that could avert what many government officials fear is a significant chance of open conflict between the two countries. “We ask, ‘Would you like to talk?’ We have lines of communications to Pyongyang — we’re not in a dark situation, a blackout,” he added. “We have a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang,” a reference to North Korea’s capital. The two countries have been trading public threats over North Korea’s nuclear program, with the North declaring that its missiles have the capacity to strike the United States and President Trump vowing to “totally destroy” North Korea. So far, the North Koreans have shown no interest in a serious negotiation. For his part, Mr. Tillerson gave no indication of what the administration might be willing to give up if talks began, and Mr. Trump has made clear he would make no concessions. But many inside and outside government have noted there were no major military exercises between the United States and South Korea scheduled until the spring, so the promise of scaling them back could be dangled. But Mr. Kim would be unlikely to see that as much of a victory and he has rejected any talks that would ultimately require him to disarm. Speaking at the residence of the United States ambassador to Beijing after a meeting with China’s top leadership, Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil and a newcomer to diplomacy, was cagey about whether the inquiries yielded anything, or seem likely to. But hours after he left China, his spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, responding to news reports of Mr. Tillerson’s comments, said in a statement that “despite assurances that the United States is not interested in promoting the collapse of the current regime” or sending American forces into the country, “North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or ready for talks regarding denuclearization.” In fact, while the Americans’ outreach was underway, the exchange of public threats between the two countries accelerated. They have included declarations that the North might conduct an atmospheric nuclear test and that it had the right to shoot down American warplanes in international waters. “We can talk to them,” Mr. Tillerson said at the end of a long day of engaging China’s leadership. “We do talk to them.” When asked whether those channels ran through China, he shook his head. “Directly,” he said. “We have our own channels.” During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said that, if elected, he would sit down and negotiate directly with Mr. Kim, perhaps over a hamburger. He seemed confident that his deal-making skills could extend to nuclear disarmament, but at times talked about getting other powers — chiefly China and Iran — to deal with North Korea for him, because they would have more leverage. But Mr. Tillerson seemed to suggest that the urgency of the problem, with Mr. Kim “launching 84 missiles” in his brief few years as the country’s leader, and its efforts to develop a hydrogen bomb, called for direct talks. And while he said the ultimate goal of those talks had to be denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula — something the two Koreas agreed on in 1992 — progress toward that goal would be “incremental.” His comments marked the first sign that the Trump administration has been trying its own version of what the Obama administration did with Iran: using a series of backchannel, largely secret communications that, after years of negotiation, resulted in a nuclear accord. But Mr. Tillerson was quick to distinguish the very different circumstances of North Korea and Iran — Pyongyang has nuclear weapons, Tehran just a program that could have led to them — and then added: “We are not going to put together a nuclear deal in North Korea that is as flimsy as the one in Iran.” Mr. Tillerson’s comments came as the administration was nearing major decision points about North Korea. While he argued that economic sanctions were finally beginning to bite — “the Chinese are saying it is having an effect,” he argued — he did not claim they would change the North’s behavior. His visit to China came as the Pentagon was considering a variety of far more aggressive military moves, including whether to strike at North Korea’s missile launching sites if it sees preparations for an atmospheric test — which would spew radioactivity into the skies — or use missile defenses to try to shoot down missiles. But all those approaches risk public failure, and if they did not stop Mr. Kim he would appear able to absorb, and ignore, an American effort to strip North Korea of its nuclear arms. American intelligence agencies are looking for ways to step up sabotage of the program, beyond the intensification of cyber attacks launched against some of its missile sites, secretly ordered by President Barack Obama in 2014. Speaking less than an hour after he left a meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Tillerson said the most important thing was to lower the temperature of the threats being exchanged in recent days between Mr. Kim and President Trump. “The whole situation is a bit overheated right now,” he said. “If North Korea would stop firing its missiles, that would calm things down a lot.” When asked whether that caution applied as well to Mr. Trump, who tweeted last weekend that if the North were to keep issuing threats, “they won’t be around much longer,” he skirted any direct criticism of the president. “I think everyone would like for it to calm down,” he said. A study conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, and released in recent days, suggests that at times of diplomatic engagement with the United States, North Korean provocations usually decline. But it is unclear that the trend applies to Mr. Kim, who at 33 has invested dramatically in the nuclear capability, seeing it as critical to his hold on power. There is a long history of negotiations, both secret and public, between the United States and the North, most ending in disappointment. The biggest success came in 1994, when former President Jimmy Carter intervened in a crisis that seemed to threaten the resumption of the Korean War. But there are risks in the talks, too. American intelligence officials believe Mr. Kim is racing ahead to complete his ability to strike the United States with a weapon, figuring that at a minimum that would give him huge negotiating leverage. Some former officials, like Michael J. Morell, who served as acting director and deputy director of the C.I.A., have written in recent weeks that Washington should give up on the hopeless goal of denuclearization, and work on how to deter the North from ever using its weapons. In Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently dissolved the lower house of Parliament and called a snap election, the news that the United States was already in direct contact with North Korea could give ammunition to Mr. Abe’s opponents. The Japanese leader has steadfastly maintained that it is not the time for dialogue with North Korea, arguing in a recent Op-Ed article in The New York Times, that “emphasizing the importance of dialogue will not work with North Korea.” “Now,” said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, “the opposition party members can say, ‘Look, you have been talking about pressure, but the U.S. is just leaving you behind.’ ” Mr. Tillerson’s comments came after three back-to-back meetings in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, just off Tiananmen Square, after his trip was delayed by a malfunction in his plane. The aging Boeing 757, which his predecessors complained about, stranded him in Japan during a refueling stop. He eventually got to Beijing, albeit half a day late, after boarding a C-130 cargo plane, leading to the unusual sight of an American secretary of state walking off the rear ramp of an aircraft better known for carrying troops than diplomats. That left Mr. Tillerson with just six hours or so to meet with Beijing’s leadership before most of the country shut down for Golden Week, a holiday that starts with China’s national day. That will be followed by the 19th Communist Party Congress, a meeting that occurs once every five years. The congress represents Mr. Xi’s moment to solidify his reputation as one of the strongest Chinese leaders in decades. In the period leading up to the Congress, Beijing has sought to preserve the status quo. That was reflected in the public comments of Mr. Tillerson and his Chinese interlocutors, none of whom mentioned the words “North Korea” in public. Mr. Xi told Mr. Tillerson earlier that he wanted to ensure that a planned visit by Mr. Trump to China in November would be a success, according to a summary of their meeting issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese Foreign Ministry noted that China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, and state councilor, Yang Jiechi, who also oversees foreign policy, did discuss the North Korean crisis with Mr. Tillerson. Those accounts did not give any details. But at the end of the day, settling into a couch at the residence of Ambassador Terry Branstad, Mr. Tillerson tried to sound optimistic that traditional diplomacy would help resolve the North Korean issue, even though it has failed past presidents. He insisted that the ultimate goal of the negotiations would be complete denuclearization, a goal many experts believe is foolhardy to attempt, because the North has made clear that its nuclear arsenal is a pillar of the state. That is acknowledged in the North Korean Constitution. “They can change their Constitution,” Mr. Tillerson said. “Especially the people running North Korea — it’s pretty easy for them to change it.”",The New York Times
2017,U.S. to Collect Social Media Data on All Immigrants Entering Country,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security will soon begin collecting social media data from all immigrants entering the United States, part of what agency officials call an effort to more effectively screen those coming to the country but privacy advocates see as an unnecessary intrusion that would do little to protect national security. The department will begin collecting the information on Oct. 18, the same day the Trump administration’s new travel ban on citizens of seven countries and restrictions on those from two others are set to take effect. Green card holders and naturalized citizens will also have their social media information collected, with the data becoming part of their immigration file. It was unclear whether the monitoring would take place only in the application process or could continue afterward. The department published the new requirement in the Federal Register last week, saying it would collect “social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results,” which would be included in an applicant’s immigration file. It said the data would come from “publicly available information obtained from the internet, public records, public institutions, interviewees, commercial data providers.” The data collection has alarmed privacy groups and lawyers, who expressed concerns on about how the department would use the information. Advocates say they also worry that the monitoring could suck in information on American citizens who communicate over social media with immigrants. “This would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the free speech that’s expressed every day on social media,” Faiz Shakir, the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. “This collect-it-all approach is ineffective to protect national security and is one more example of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda.” Efforts to collect social media information are not unique to the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, the department had begun asking visitors to voluntarily provide social media information, and had four pilot screening programs. After the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., counterterrorism officials and lawmakers grew increasingly worried about the use of social media by terrorist groups like the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Many members of Congress, mainly Republicans, began urging the Department of Homeland Security to use data gleaned from visa applicants’ or asylum seekers’ social media accounts as part of the immigration process. Congressional Democrats also supported the effort to collect social media data on visa applicants. “We believe these checks, focused on possible connections to terrorist activity, should be incorporated into D.H.S.’s vetting process for visa determinations, and that this policy should be implemented as soon as possible,” Democratic lawmakers said in a letter at the time. The attackers in San Bernardino, Tashfeen Malik and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, had exchanged private online messages discussing their commitment to jihad and martyrdom, law enforcement officials said. But they did not post any public messages about their plans on Facebook or other social media platforms. One of the pilot projects, which began in December 2015, screened the social media accounts of applicants for so-called fiancé visas, the program under which Ms. Malik entered the United States. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the part of the Department of Homeland Security that approves citizenship and green cards, has previously used social media as part of the screening process for Syrian refugees, but only when the person was flagged because of a hit in an intelligence database or when questions were raised during an interview with immigration officials. Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University, said although it was true that the Obama administration collected social media information, the new monitoring put in place by the Trump administration represented an escalation. “What is different here is that it appears that they are monitoring people who are already in the United States — green card holders, for example,” she said. “And there is a lack of transparency of how they are using this data, which does heighten the concerns for this group of people.”",The New York Times
2017,U2 Offers ‘Songs of Experience’ to a World That’s on Fire,"Back in March 2016, U2 was in Killiney, a luxurious seaside suburb of Dublin, immersed in sessions for the follow-up to its 2014 album “Songs of Innocence.” The band had rented a white Victorian mansion and outfitted it as a recording studio, with equipment set up in the bay-windowed parlor so the band — Bono, the Edge on guitar, Adam Clayton on bass and Larry Mullen Jr. on drums — could jam together. Mr. Mullen had a second kit temporarily nested in a stairwell with a roaring echo — a recording technique learned from Led Zeppelin lore that had already paid off. The day before I visited, he and the Edge had adapted a bass line from a song by Haim into a stomping, start-stop guitar riff, and Bono had immediately roughed out some lyrics. When I arrived, U2 and one of its producers, Jolyon Thomas, gathered to play back the brand-new song, along with half a dozen others destined for the album. There was live recording to be done, too. Bono, perpetually energetic, announced that he had woken up at 5 a.m. with an entirely new chorus lyric for a song. “I dreamed it, so it could be awful,” he warned. With the backup track cranked up loud in the parlor — no earphones or vocal booth for Bono — he sang the new lyrics, take after quick take. A brief silence, and then Bono asked those in the room for opinions. “It feels like a more believable thing,” the Edge said, and there were nods of approval. Things seemed to be moving along fast. But that was more than a year ago, and those lyrics wouldn’t make the album’s final cut. The other songs I heard that day would also go through many metamorphoses before the album was done: changes of structure, tempo, sonics. And then, just as the album was all but complete, British and American elections shook up the world, delaying the album again and eventually bringing a darker, more directly political cast to some of the lyrics. “We needed some distance from it,” Bono said. “The world had changed. We needed to put things on pause to take in the scale of the change.” The album, “Songs of Experience,” is now scheduled to arrive Dec. 1. It appears at a moment when popular culture is gathering its spirit of righteousness and resistance — a moment that could well be suited to U2, whose pealing guitars and martial beats have, through the years, become rock’s sonic signature of idealism. “Songs of Experience” merges personal reflections with tidings from the wider world, and it calls for compassion, empathy and rectitude. “The wickedness in the world, we just let it perforate the album,” Bono said. “But it still had to be a very personal album, not a polemic.” He added, “The elections were a shock to the system personally and a shock to the system politically, not just in America but in Europe. This is my lyrical response to both of those shocks. I leaned more on the personal than the political, but the political is there to put the personal songs in the context of time, of history.” Bono was on the phone from the south of France, just over a week ago. “As I look out the window, at the Mediterranean sea that is so tranquil today,” he said, “I see young families splashing about. And just across, hardly a distance at all, are people tacking their lives to bits of wood and creating these human flotillas to escape from what is still a war across the way. I wanted to write about that.” U2 released “The Blackout” as a performance video at the end of August. It’s a buzzing, thumping rocker that begins, “Dinosaur wonders why it still walks the earth” and later wonders, “Is this an extinction event”; it also observes, “Statues fall/Democracy is flat on its back.” In writing and rewriting the song, Bono said, “I made it about democracy, not an aging rock star.” U2 refuses to rush its albums. Ever more aware of its singular status as a rock band that has started its fifth decade with its original lineup — and is still selling out arenas and stadiums — the group constantly weighs both its past and its determination to move ahead. Its ambitions are high-minded and grandly scaled; its attitude remains earnest, patient and craftsmanlike. “We still really believe that we can make a great record,” the Edge said last month by telephone from Dublin, where he was pondering the final sequence of “Songs of Experience” and working on guitar sounds for the next U2 tour, built around this album. (The band’s current worldwide stadium tour celebrating the 30th anniversary of “The Joshua Tree” runs through October). “Which is a very different motivation to go in to make an album than thinking, ‘Well, we’ve got to whip one out for the fans.’” It’s a sentiment Bono would echo. “It’s almost impossible to be great,” he said. “That’s why we call it great. And that’s our drug of choice. Very good is the enemy of great — there’s lots of that. But who wants to be in a very good band at this point? Whatever you think of our oeuvre, or whatever you think of the U2 group, we’re still attempting to get beyond ourselves.” When U2 released “Songs of Innocence,” it immediately promised a follow-up with the title readers of William Blake would expect: “Songs of Experience.” But “Songs of Experience” isn’t exactly a sequel. “Songs of Innocence” was as explicitly autobiographical as U2 had ever been, including one song named after Bono’s mother, “Iris,” and another citing the street where he grew up, “Cedarwood Road.” In contrast, “Songs of Experience” returns to the broader strokes that fill U2’s catalog: love, fear, mortality, responsibility and hope. Many of the songs, Bono said, are like letters addressed to specific recipients: his family, his friends, the audience, America. Above all, the new album posits “joy as an act of defiance,” Bono said. “That’s the heart of rock ’n’ roll, that’s its life force.” As usual, U2 worked on — and worked over — the album with multiple producers from various spheres and styles. Mr. Thomas has worked with the rawboned rock duo Royal Blood; other producers included Ryan Tedder from OneRepublic, Jacknife Lee and one of the band’s career-long collaborators, Steve Lillywhite. The band also sent some works in progress to Kendrick Lamar, hoping to get a guest rap from him as a kindred socially conscious musician. Instead, Mr. Lamar used a vocal line from Bono for “XXX” on his “DAMN.” album. On U2’s album, the snippet is part of a full-length song about America and its history of welcoming immigrants. The new songs rove from U2’s arena anthems to celestial ambient hymns, echoes of 1950s rock and glimpses of disco and new wave. “All our best work has that pull between experimental on one hand and pop clarity on the other,” Bono said. For “Songs of Experience,” U2’s self-imposed agenda was “a commitment to the fine art of songwriting,” Bono said. He and the Edge both spoke about hearing more innovation outside rock than within it: in R&B, hip-hop and pop. “Seeing the demise of a certain kind of songwriting, particularly in rock, it made the band determined to go there,” Bono said. “Crafting songs, melodies and modulations, and lyrics that people could follow. ‘Sunday Bloody Sunday’ — that’s a big melody, and declarative, and not trying to be cool. The problem with rock now is that it’s trying to be cool. But clear thoughts and big melodies — if they come from a true place, they not only capture the instant, they become eternal in a way.” The Edge offered a simpler criterion: “On this record, we went, ‘Is it going to be played by people in a bar in 25 years?’” After decades in the public eye, U2 is thoroughly self-conscious. Bono, who has leveraged his rock-star renown toward global initiatives that include battling HIV and AIDS and reducing extreme poverty, constantly analyzes his own efforts. “What’s the difference between ‘Innocence’ and “Experience’?” he said. “The core of ‘Innocence’ to me is a lyric from our second album, which says, ‘I can’t change the world, but I can change the world in me.’ The core of ‘Experience’ is — and this is cheeky! — ‘I can change the world, but I can’t change the world in me.’ And so you realize that the biggest obstacle in the way is yourself. There are things to rail against, and there are things that deserve your rage, and you must plot and conspire to overthrow them. But the most wily and fearsome of your enemies is going to turn out to be yourself. And that’s experience.” “Songs of Innocence” was released as a free album that suddenly appeared in the libraries of iTunes users worldwide, only to be greeted by many people not as a gift but as an invasion of their private music collections — an exercise in hubris rather than generosity. Yet band members believe that in the end, the giveaway introduced U2 to the newer, younger fans they see at their recent concert audiences. “Songs of Experience” is being presented as a more old-school album, released through standard channels with plenty of notice. U2 has been playing one of its songs, “The Little Things that Give You Away,” on its “Joshua Tree” tour, and it just released the album’s first studio single, “You’re the Best Thing About Me.” It’s as straightforward a love song as anything in U2’s repertory — sparked, band members said, by the example of vintage Motown songs, though it ended up sounding far different. “You’re putting out a song about your girlfriend when the world is on fire?,” Bono asked, anticipating one reaction. “Yes. Joy is an act of defiance.”",The New York Times
2017,"Uber C.E.O., Reacting to London Ban, Apologizes for ‘Mistakes’","LONDON — Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, apologized in an open letter on Monday for the company’s “mistakes,” after the transport authority for London said last week that it would not renew the ride-hailing service’s license to operate in the city. “While Uber has revolutionized the way people move in cities around the world, it’s equally true that we’ve got things wrong along the way,” Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote. “On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologize for the mistakes we’ve made.” The statement did not specify what, exactly, Uber was apologizing for, but the conciliatory tone represented a stark change for a company that, under its previous chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was better known for its aggressive approach from the get-go. Uber intends to appeal the decision last Friday by Transport for London, a move that would prevent the company from doing business in its biggest European market, and it will be allowed to continue to operate during the appeals process. The company says it has 40,000 drivers in London and 3.5 million customers who use the service at least once every three months. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who had initially accused Uber of responding to the decision with aggressive threats, said he welcomed the apology and supported the idea of talks between the city and the company. “Obviously I am pleased that he has acknowledged the issues that Uber faces in London,” Mr. Khan said in a statement. “Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him,” he added, using the abbreviation for the transit agency. Mr. Khan had said on BBC Radio earlier that Uber was not playing by the rules and had made aggressive threats to take London’s transport authorities to court. “You can’t have it both ways — on the one hand acting in an aggressive manner and threatening all sorts of things, on the other hand brief to journalists that they want to do a deal with TfL,” he said. Fred Jones, a senior executive for Uber in Britain, told BBC radio that Uber was eager to meet with London travel authorities and that the company was “not clear” about the issues the transit agency had raised. In its decision on Friday, the agency cited problems with the company’s approach to background checks and to reporting criminal offenses. “Providing an innovative service is not an excuse for not following the rules,” Mr. Khan said in a statement on Friday. “I have every sympathy with Uber drivers and customers affected by this decision, but their anger really should be directed at Uber,” Mr. Khan added. “They have let down their drivers and customers by failing, in the view of TfL, to act as a fit and proper operator.” The decision was divisive, winning praise from unions and the drivers of London’s iconic black cabs, who view Uber as a threat to their business. A petition started by Uber, which criticizes the move, has received the support of more than 750,000 people. In it, the company accused Transport for London of wanting to “restrict consumer choice” and making a decision that would affect the lives of hard-working drivers. Uber will face more scrutiny of its working model in Britain on Wednesday, when a court will hear its appeal against a case it lost in October. A judge had ruled then that Uber drivers should be classified as employees and should be treated as such. Uber says its drivers prefer to be self-employed. If upheld, the judgment would drastically change the dynamics of the so-called gig economy in Britain, forcing companies like Uber to provide workers with the payment, protections and benefits to which full employees are entitled, rather than treating them as contractors.

2017,Uber Loses License to Operate in London,"LONDON — Uber’s history of scandals and disregard for local rules finally caught up with it on Friday, when London declined to renew the ride-hailing company’s license to operate in the city, its largest European market. Transport for London, the agency that oversees the city’s subways, buses and taxicabs, declared that Uber was not sufficiently “fit and proper.” The designation carries significant weight in Britain. The decision, which Uber plans to appeal, raises the possibility that other cities could be emboldened to crack down on the company. Over the past few years, Uber has been temporarily forced out of a few major markets, like Delhi in India and Austin, Tex. Uber also voluntarily left China after selling its business there to a rival, Didi Chuxing. But it had never been told to leave a market as important as London. Losing the license to operate in London presents a major challenge for Uber’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, who replaced its founder, Travis Kalanick, in August. The company has faced an array of controversies over the past year or so, including charges of insufficient background checks on drivers, the use of software to evade the gaze of the authorities, and complaints of an aggressive, unrestrained workplace culture. In an email to Uber employees obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Khosrowshahi said that he thought the London decision was unfair, but that “the truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation.” He added that “it’s critical that we act with integrity in everything we do, and learn how to be a better partner to every city we operate in.” A ban on operating in one of its largest markets would certainly hit Uber’s bottom line. The company said it had 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in London who used its app at least once every three months. Mr. Khosrowshahi, in a Twitter post on Friday afternoon, acknowledged that Uber was “far from perfect” and urged city regulators to work out a solution with the company. Less than a year ago, a British tribunal ruled that Uber could no longer treat its drivers as self-employed contractors and would have to meet tougher labor standards, including offering holiday pay and pensions. “Fit and proper” is a benchmark that Britain applies across different industries and its charitable organizations to ensure that people or organizations meet the requirements of their industry or specialty. “Uber’s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications,” Transport for London said in a statement. Tests typically assess factors like an individual or company’s honesty, transparency and competence, though there is no formal exam. In Uber’s case, Transport for London said it had examined issues of how the company dealt with serious criminal offenses, how it conducted background checks on drivers and its justification for a software program called Greyball, which “could be used to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app.” In May, Transport for London extended Uber’s license by four months as it considered whether the company met that threshold. “Providing an innovative service is not an excuse for it being unsafe,” London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, wrote in The Guardian soon after the ruling was announced. “The regulatory environment is critical in protecting Londoners’ safety, maintaining workplace standards for drivers and sustaining a vibrant taxi and private hire market with space for a range of providers to flourish.” Uber’s London license will now expire on Sept. 30. But it can continue to operate in the city during the appeal process in Britain’s courts. Tom Elvidge, Uber’s general manager in London, said the agency and Mr. Khan had “caved in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice.” What would London without Uber look like? We want to hear from those in London about their experience, including those who work, or have worked, for Uber. Uber conducted background checks using the methods used for black-cab drivers, he said. “Our pioneering technology has gone further to enhance safety with every trip tracked and recorded by GPS,” Mr. Elvidge said, adding that the company had “a dedicated team who work closely with the Metropolitan Police.” He also said Greyball had not been used to block scrutiny by regulators or the police in London. The move by regulators in London “picks up the political mood of the times,” said Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics. “London, like New York and Paris, is full of urban progressives who, even if they use Uber, feel guilty when they read things about it that they don’t like.” On Thursday, a Dutch appeals court upheld a ban of an Uber service in the Netherlands, saying the company’s low-cost UberPop ride-hailing offering had been operated illegally. The French authorities took a similar case to the Court of Justice of the European Union, and last year Uber and two executives were convicted and fined the equivalent of nearly $500,000 in France in relation to UberPop. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has criticized Uber’s rapid expansion for making congestion worse on city streets. But in 2015, his administration backed down from a fight with Uber by abruptly dropping a plan for a cap on the number of Uber vehicles operating within the city. Until now, London had been one of Uber’s most notable success stories outside the United States. It debuted in the city in 2012, just before the Summer Olympics, initially with a luxury service. It added UberX, which competes more directly with the city’s storied black taxis, a year later. The company now operates in more than 40 cities and towns across Britain. Its arrival here, however, created a clash almost immediately with the black cabs, which trace their roots to 1634. Black-cab drivers, who earn licenses by memorizing some 25,000 streets and 100,000 landmarks for an exacting test known as The Knowledge, complain that Uber drivers are under-regulated. Many fear that the rivalry will put them out of business: Uber fares are about 30 percent lower than those of black cabs. The conflict also involves tensions over ethnicity and class. Most black-cab drivers are white native-born Britons, while many Uber drivers are immigrants. Uber has said it receives hundreds of complaints a month from its drivers about remarks from black-cab drivers. Among the insults hurled are “Uber slave!” and “Go back to your country!” Many black-cab drivers have now signed up with competing apps like Gett and MyTaxi, which like Uber allow passengers to hail rides via their smartphones. Londoners can also choose from a wide variety of private-hire services, known as minicabs. Black-cab drivers, and the unions representing them, cheered Friday’s ruling. Jeffrey Marcus, who has been driving a London taxi for 42 years, described it as “long overdue.” “We’ve got a brilliant taxi service here,” Mr. Marcus, 67, said. “You pay a little more for a licensed taxi, but you get the service.” The reaction online to the Transport for London ruling, however, was generally negative. Hours after the decision was announced, a Change.org petition that was started and heavily promoted by Uber within its app and via emails to customers had over 200,000 signatures. Ahmad Shoaib, an Uber driver, said the service was being unfairly targeted. “I know there have been some problems with drivers, but most of us are good and reliable and play by the rules,” he said. “It is not fair to punish everyone because of the mistakes of one or two people.” Mr. Shoaib switched to Uber from a minicab company in Croydon, in South London, after he saw how much work friends were getting from the ride-hailing service. “London needs Uber,” he said, “it’s cheap and easy.” OpinionSteven Hill",The New York Times
2017,Uber Says It Will Leave Quebec Rather Than Face New Rules,"OTTAWA — Uber said on Tuesday that it would stop service in Montreal and the Quebec province next month rather than accept new government rules, the second setback in a week for the ride-hailing service’s international operations. On Friday, the taxi regulator in London announced that it would not renew Uber’s license, saying that the ride-hailing business had demonstrated a “lack of corporate responsibility.” Until recently, Uber appeared to have reveled in ignoring local regulations as it shoved its way into markets. But its aggressive ways, combined with a series of scandals, may be catching up with it. Last month, Dara Khosrowshahi was brought in as chief executive to replace Uber’s co-founder, Travis Kalanick, who had been forced to step down. Quebec’s decision to dictate terms to Uber is another sign that governments and regulators are less willing to back down when faced by intimidation from the company. In Quebec, where Uber has sparked large protests by Montreal cabdrivers who argue that it has eroded their livelihoods by ignoring laws, the ride-hailing company has operated for a year under a special authorization while it negotiated permanent rules with the government. Last week, Laurent Lessard, the provincial transport minister, announced conditions he was seeking in exchange for extending the program for another 12 months. Jean-Nicolas Guillemette, the general manager of Uber Montreal, said on Tuesday that the company could not accept the government’s plan to increase the minimum training for Uber drivers to 35 hours, up from 20 hours. The higher level matches the rule in Montreal for taxi drivers. Unless the government withdraws its plan, Mr. Guillemette said, Uber would quit the province on Oct. 14. “The minister is attempting to impose old rules on a new model,” Mr. Guillemette told a news conference. “These are major changes.” Uber has about 10,000 drivers in Montreal. Mr. Guillemette said that the increased training would make it difficult to recruit new drivers, particularly those who only want to work part time. Mr. Guillemette added that Uber can provide sufficient training in less time through alternate methods. “We firmly believe that technology allows us to provide what the government wants in terms of training,” he said. Uber hopes to continue discussions with the province leading up to the deadline, Mr. Guillemette. But if the government sticks by its 35-hour rule, he added, “we’ll need to leave.” Mathieu Goudrault, a spokesman for the transport minister, said that the 35-hour minimum would now apply to all taxi drivers in Quebec, adding that the government would not consider a lower threshold for Uber drivers. For licensed taxi drivers, the new minimum represents a considerable reduction from the previous requirement of 150 hours. The province also wants criminal background checks on Uber drivers to be made by the police rather than by private firms. It will also require mandatory, annual vehicle inspections. In London, Uber is appealing the decision by the transport authority to not renew the ride-hailing service’s license to operate in the city. Mr. Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief, apologized in an open letter on Monday for the company’s “mistakes.” Georges Malouf, a taxi company owner speaking on behalf of the industry in Montreal, characterized Uber’s decision as negotiating tactic. “Uber is not obliged to stop its operations, it’s only doing it to frustrate users and to put pressure on the government,” he said in a statement. He added that it now remains to be seen if the provincial government will stand up to the company or “fall flat under Uber’s pressure.” Taxi drivers in Montreal and Quebec City have staged several large protests against Uber. Last October, about 1,500 cabs brought traffic in downtown Montreal to a halt. Cabdrivers and owners also made unsuccessful attempts to obtain court injunctions to shut Uber down. “This is the kind of corporation we don’t need in Quebec,” said Alain Croteau, the Quebec director of the United Steelworkers, which represents most of Montreal’s cabdrivers. “They gave a chance to Uber with the pilot project. The government of Quebec needs to keep its position.”",The New York Times
2017,Uber’s Contrite Stance in London May Hint at a Fruitful New Path,"Breakingviews “Move fast and break things” may have been Facebook’s mantra, but few companies have taken the slogan to heart like Uber Technologies. The ride-hailing company, which not long ago was valued at nearly $70 billion, has pushed aggressively into one market after another. In London, watchdogs are now pushing back, and the Silicon Valley invader is finally seeking permission to continue operating, rather than asking for after-the-fact forgiveness for breaking rules. Dara Khosrowshahi only recently took over as chief executive from Travis Kalanick, an Uber founder who was forced out of the top job for allowing, with an insufficiently vigilant board, a frat-boy culture to permeate the rapidly growing company. With Uber’s reputation tarnished and its valuation in danger of falling, Mr. Khosrowshahi came into the job on a damage-limitation mission. That was even before London’s transportation regulator, Transport for London, dropped its bombshell last week, declining to renew the company’s license to operate in the British capital. Many Londoners are up in arms. A “Save Your Uber” petition begun by the company — a tactic that previously helped reverse regulators’ decisions in London and New York — has attracted nearly 800,000 signatures. Aside from valuing the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of the service, some Uber users fear that Transport for London’s decision suggests that London isn’t as open for business as it likes to appear, especially with the so-called Brexit looming. Yet officials elsewhere have shown themselves even less accommodating. Uber executives were arrested in France, for example. And rules mostly exist for a reason. It is true that the operators of London’s famous, and famously pricey, black cabs, and labor groups, have long lobbied against Uber and its tech-savvy rivals. But the young company has a record of doing whatever suits it best and only answering questions later. Transport for London is right to take doubts about customers’ safety and security seriously, and to consider questions about software that could hamper effective regulation. Mr. Khosrowshahi’s plea for another chance and offer to “work with London to make things right” attest to a more inclusive, stakeholder-friendly approach than the one exhibited by his prickly predecessor; it also contrasts with the initial response from top company executives in Britain. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and others seem to be receptive. As Uber tries to turn its dramatic market-share success into something profitable, the company needs more of that kind of approach. Starting on the Thames, compromise could become its reboot strategy.",The New York Times

When Mr. Grodzki grew up, he fell into the weekend hobby of making bags and pouches, many of which he gave to his friends. Eventually, he said, at the request of a roommate, he made an apron. “Once I made that, it dawned on me that I was making aprons and bags, like my grandfather had been doing,” Mr. Grodzki said. In 2008, shops in Brooklyn and elsewhere started stocking the things he made, and Stanley & Sons Apron and Bag Company was born. Now stylish boutiques across the United States and in Japan carry Stanley & Sons aprons and totes, which are pleasing to the eye and made of canvas, cotton or denim, many with leather straps or accents.

2017,"Under Mayor de Blasio, City Vehicles Rack Up Miles","If it seems like traffic in New York City might be a bit worse than before, there may be an unexpected factor: city workers. New York City’s sprawling municipal work force is driving more than it used to, city statistics reveal. City vehicles logged 102 million miles on the road in the last fiscal year, which ended in June, 25 percent more miles than in 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s first year in office. Accidents are also up: Workers driving city-owned cars for the Department of Buildings were involved in 98 crashes last fiscal year, an increase from 22 crashes four years ago. Department of Correction vehicles were involved in 116 crashes, nearly double the number four years ago. The Department of Transportation and Parks Department fared no better. The city’s fleet — everything from take-home cars to garbage trucks — now exceeds 30,000 vehicles, 10 percent larger than when Mr. de Blasio took office. The growth of the fleet coincides with the sharp expansion of the city’s work force under Mr. de Blasio, a surge in head count that the mayor has proudly defended as necessary for serving the population of a growing city. There are more than 294,000 full-time employees of New York City and the equivalent of 25,000 more who work part time. But transportation advocates have expressed concern that the attendant rise in driving, which has outpaced the growth in head count and has not been previously reported, could undercut some of Mr. de Blasio’s signature goals. More driving makes it harder to reduce the number of traffic fatalities, which Mr. de Blasio has vowed to reduce to zero, and to address the pollution that contributes to climate change. In recent days, Mr. de Blasio has announced his intention to mandate energy efficiency from large buildings across the city, and unveiled new electric vehicle charging stations that will eventually arrive in each of the five boroughs to encourage New Yorkers to buy zero-emission vehicles. “This is nothing less than an existential threat and every person, every state, every city has to be a part of the solution,” Mr. de Blasio said on Wednesday of climate change. But the increase in driving runs afoul of his plan for reducing the city’s emissions 80 percent by the year 2050, which calls for New Yorkers to “significantly reduce the number of miles driven.” On that score, the city government is heading in the other direction. “Very clearly the more cars and trucks we have on our streets, the worse he’s going to do on achieving those goals,” said Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives and an ally of Mr. de Blasio on his Vision Zero traffic safety plan. “The mayor’s blind spot for the myriad externalities of unchecked driving threatens to undo his good work.” Under Mr. de Blasio, the city has doubled the number of electric vehicles in its fleet to 1,500, and nearly one in five of city vehicles are hybrids, according to statistics provided by City Hall. Even so, city vehicles consumed 29.6 million gallons of gasoline in the last fiscal year, according to the most recent mayor’s management report, up from 28.8 million gallons the previous fiscal year. “While it will take our city government significant time to get there, we are working toward the once unthought-of goal of an all-electric car fleet,” Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said in a statement. When it comes to crashes, the city began tracking all manner of collisions — from “scratches and mirror issues” to those in which an injury or death occurred — in the 2014 fiscal year as part of Mr. de Blasio’s traffic safety initiative, city officials said. Since then, the number of traffic crashes involving city vehicles has increased by 8 percent to 6,363, according to the management report. Department of Sanitation vehicles accounted for more than half of that increase since 2014. Its vehicles frequently come in close contact with other cars during garbage collection and snow removal. (The department showed some improvement last year, the management report showed.) The crash and mileage figures do not include the Police Department, which lists only a rate of crashes per 100,000 miles traveled. The department’s crash rate increased in the last fiscal year to 4.6 per 100,000 miles, from 3.9. Four years ago, it was 5.3 per 100,000 miles. The increase in crashes, City Hall officials said, could be attributed to the new system’s improved accounting of minor crashes, rather than an increase in unsafe driving. The number of workers driving city-owned vehicles who were hurt in crashes last year also increased, to 727 injuries, from 510 the year before, according to the mayor’s report. But that jump came after three straight years of declines. And because of the steep rise in the number of miles driven by city workers, the rate of injury per 100,000 miles of driving has actually declined. Moreover, fewer people have been killed in crashes — a key goal of the mayor’s Vision Zero plan. The city recorded one fatality in each of the last two years in crashes involving city vehicles, down from eight in the 2014 fiscal year. That sort of parsing of the data did not satisfy some transit advocates who called on the city to curb its driving. “There are three paths for reducing crashes: design safer streets, stop/prevent dangerous driving and reduce the number of vehicles,” said Charles Komanoff, an energy-policy analyst and environmental activist who has criticized Mr. de Blasio for his daily routine of driving from Gracie Mansion to a gym in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and then to City Hall, a detour that adds more than a dozen miles to his commute. In an email, Mr. Komanoff said the mayor has made improvements on the first, done little on the second and “is stuck in reverse on No. 3.”",The New York Times

In fact, the drop in unemployment and the rise in wages have been stronger for them by some measures. These estimates are based on data that the Labor Department uses for the monthly jobs reports, combined with a model of voting based on demographics. Contrary to popular perception, likelier Trump supporters were doing better over all in the labor market than likelier Clinton supporters both before and after the election. Throughout 2016 and in 2017, both the unemployment rate and a broader measure, U-6, which captures people who are working part-time but want a full-time job and those who would like a job but have given up looking out of frustration, were lower for likelier Trump supporters than for likelier Clinton supporters. Median full-time wages were higher for likelier Trump supporters, too. These results reflect the fact that Trump voters were older and whiter than Clinton voters. Despite less current hardship, likelier Trump supporters might have had more economic anxiety about the future, because they tend to be less educated and likelier to work in so-called routine jobs that are at higher risk from automation. That’s consistent with my previous findings about greater automation risk in redder counties and metro areas. What has happened since Inauguration Day? The unemployment rate has fallen by equal amounts for both groups: to 3.6 percent in July from 4 percent in January for likelier Trump supporters, and to 4.5 percent from 4.9 percent for likelier Clinton supporters. The prime-age employment-population ratio has risen by 0.4 percentage points for both groups. This measure, unlike the unemployment rate, accounts for whether people have dropped out of the labor force entirely. The prime-age labor force participation rate has also increased similarly for both groups. On other measures, likelier Clinton supporters have seen more improvement than likelier Trump supporters since January. The broader U-6 rate has fallen by 0.8 points for likelier Clinton supporters and by 0.6 points for likelier Trump supporters. And median usual weekly earnings are up 2.9 percent for likelier Clinton supporters versus 1.8 percent for likelier Trump supporters. The story is similar if we look at eight months of data after Election Day instead of six months after Inauguration Day. Why are labor market gains tilting in a different direction than economic confidence? The rise in political tribalism in one obvious explanation for partisan differences in confidence in the economy. But there are other reasons. The improvement in labor market outcomes for likelier Clinton supporters might, in part, be a closing of gaps that widened during the recession, such as racial differences in the unemployment rate. (Blacks, who tended to support Mrs. Clinton, endured more economic hardship during the recession than whites.) Also, economic confidence predicts actual behaviors weakly at best. Debates continue about how much economics affected the 2016 vote, but an improving job market is both a core aspiration and a bragging point for incumbent politicians regardless of party. If jobs and wages matter in how Americans judge presidents and how they eventually vote, the post-inauguration decline and persistent partisan divide in Trump’s approval rating are all the more striking given the bigger economic lift received by likelier Clinton supporters. Only seven months into the new administration, it’s far too soon to say whether the Trump years will eventually bring more jobs and higher wages to his base than to his detractors. But so far, the difference in labor market success has, if anything, gone in the opposite direction of the partisan swing in economic confidence. Methodology The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the official unemployment rate and other labor-market indicators from the monthly Current Population Survey (C.P.S.) of households. That survey does not ask respondents whom they voted for or which political party they belong to. But it does ask about demographic variables, including age; race and ethnicity; educational attainment; sex; marital status; presence of dependent children in the household; and state of residence. We used those variables — and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, which includes more than 40,000 respondents who voted for Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton — to predict 2016 vote choice. “Likelier Trump supporters” and “likelier Clinton supporters” in the C.P.S. are defined based on their demographic similarity to actual Trump voters and actual Clinton voters in the C.C.E.S. Estimates of labor market indicators for each group are weighted by the probability of each C.P.S. respondent’s being a likelier Trump supporter or a likelier Clinton supporter. More details are available here; this academic paper takes a similar approach to voting prediction.",The New York Times
2017,"Under ‘Observation,’ Some Hospital Patients Face Big Bills","The New Old Age In April, Nancy Niemi entered Vidant Medical Center in Greenville, N.C., with cardiac problems. She stayed four nights, at one point receiving a coronary stent. Then she went home, but felt faint and took several falls. Five days later, her primary care doctor sent her back to the hospital. This time, her stay lasted 39 days while physicians tried various medications to regulate her blood pressure. Though they eventually succeeded, Mrs. Niemi, 84, a retired insurance agent, had grown so weak that she could no longer walk. “They said, ‘She really needs to go to a skilled nursing facility for physical therapy,’” recalled her son Tom Krpata, 63, who’d come from his home in Holliston, Mass., to be with her. He agreed, but soon learned one of the brutal truths of Medicare policy: Patients can be hospitalized for days, can undergo exams and tests, can receive drugs — without ever officially being admitted to the hospital. Instead, they’re “under observation,” which means they’re outpatients, not inpatients. That can bring financial hardships — including lack of coverage for subsequent nursing home care. That’s why Mrs. Niemi, on observation status through both hospital stays except for one night, had to pay for rehab herself. “By declaring her an outpatient, they really took away her Medicare benefits,” Mr. Krpata said. Patients can appeal virtually any other claim that Medicare denies. But there’s no way to appeal observation status. Even Mrs. Niemi’s congressman, contacted by her family, couldn’t help. But a recent ruling in a case that’s bounced through the courts since 2011 may be a harbinger of changes to come. On July 31, a federal judge in Connecticut certified a class in a class-action lawsuit: all Medicare recipients who’ve been hospitalized and received observation services as outpatients since January 1, 2009. That means hundreds of thousands of people, Ms. Niemi among them, will be eligible to join the suit against the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, with a trial expected next year. If the plaintiffs prevail, they’ll be able to appeal their observation-outpatient stays. “People call in dire situations, and we have to tell them there’s no way to challenge this,” said Alice Bers, litigation director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, which brought the lawsuit with Justice in Aging and a law firm, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. “Now we can tell them, ‘You’re a member of the class, so stay tuned.’” A quick primer on a confusing situation: Medicare Part A covers hospital care for inpatients. Outpatients, including those on observation status, are covered under Part B. That distinction has generated complaints and controversy for years, as the number of inpatient hospitalizations has declined among Medicare recipients and outpatient stays have become more common. Why does the classification matter? Outpatients can face higher payments for drugs and coinsurance, but the big-ticket item is nursing home care. After a hospital discharge, Medicare pays the full cost of skilled nursing for the first 20 days, and most costs up to 100 days — but only for patients who’ve spent three consecutive days as inpatients. Without three inpatient days, patients are on their own. Though most observation patients return home and needn’t to worry about nursing home costs, nearly two-thirds of those who do need skilled nursing have to shoulder the substantial costs themselves, according to a report from the AARP Public Policy Institute. They hadn’t met the three-day inpatient requirement. Many, fearing the costs, skipped rehab in a nursing facility altogether, the researchers found. Mrs. Niemi did go to a nursing home and now owes close to $5,000 — only because nursing homes near Greenville charge a comparatively modest $150 to $160 a day. Nationally, nursing home care cost $225 a day last year, according to the Genworth Cost of Care Study, and more than $400 a day in cities like New York and San Francisco. Recognizing the problem, Congress passed legislation that took effect earlier this year, requiring that hospitals inform patients when they’re not inpatients but are under observation. So while it came as news to Mr. Krpata that his mother’s status would mean no coverage for a nursing home, at least he knew what her status was — not that he could do anything about it. Medicare administrators, who declined to comment for this article because of the ongoing litigation, tried to clarify observation status in 2013 with the so-called “two midnight rule.” When physicians expect a hospitalized patient to need care for at least two midnights, Medicare expects that inpatient care is probably appropriate; for shorter stays, beneficiaries would likely remain outpatients. The rule hasn’t helped, though, according to a report last year from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. Inpatient stays are still decreasing and outpatient stays are growing, the report found. More of those outpatients have “limited access” to skilled nursing afterward, and pay more for it. Gaining the right to appeal observation-outpatient classification won’t solve that problem, even if patients should win their class action suit. “The Medicare appeals system is far from perfect,” said Ms. Bers. Patients routinely lose in the early stages, and though their odds of success improve if they pursue the appeal to an administrative law judge, many drop out before that point. A far more effective remedy: the Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act that Rep. Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, has introduced in each Congress since 2010. It calls for counting any consecutive three days spent in a hospital toward the requirement for nursing home benefits, regardless of whether people are inpatients or outpatients. Not only has the bill drawn broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, a raft of medical and advocacy groups also have also endorsed it, including the American Medical Association and AARP. “Going to a nursing facility is not on everybody’s wish list,” said Carol Levine, director of the United Hospital Fund’s Families and Health Care Project, who said she was not speaking for the group. “But if it’s the best alternative for the patient, they shouldn’t have to jump over these kinds of bureaucratic rules that make it financially impossible.” So far, though, the legislation has gone nowhere. For now, suing Medicare for the right to appeal probably offers the best route to fairer treatment for hospitalized patients. “That’s the way these things move, in incremental steps,” Ms. Levine said. “And this could be an important one.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Undercover With the Alt-Right,"Op-Ed Contributor Last September, Patrik Hermansson, a 25-year-old graduate student from Sweden, went undercover in the world of the extreme right. Posing as a student writing a thesis about the suppression of right-wing speech, he traveled from London to New York to Charlottesville, Va. — and into the heart of a dangerous movement that is experiencing a profound rejuvenation. Mr. Hermansson, who was sent undercover by the British anti-racist watchdog group Hope Not Hate, spent months insinuating himself into the alt-right, using his Swedish nationality (many neo-Nazis are obsessed with Sweden because of its “Nordic” heritage) as a way in. It wasn’t always easy. “You want to punch them in the face,” he told me of the people he met undercover. “You want to scream and do whatever — leave. But you can’t do any of those things. You have to sit and smile.” What he learned while undercover is one part of a shocking, comprehensive new report from Hope Not Hate that sheds light on the strange landscape of the alt-right, the much discussed, little understood and largely anonymous far-right movement that exists mostly online and that has come to national attention in part because of its support for Donald Trump. As a result of the growing influence of the far-right social-media ecosystem, once-moribund hate groups in both the United States and Europe — groups that mostly existed long before “alt-right” entered the vernacular — are enjoying a striking uptick in recruitment. This latest wave of potential members is young — teenage and 20-something men (they’re mostly men) appear to be exhibiting interest in far-right ideas in numbers that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. These young men are being radicalized largely through the work of a popular group of new far-right internet personalities whose videos, blog posts and tweets have been consistently nudging the boundaries of acceptable conversation to the right — one of the explicit goals of racist extremists everywhere. And while “globalist” may be one of the alt-right’s favorite slurs, Hope Not Hate conclusively shows that the alt-right is itself now a global movement with regular interaction among far-right figures from Scotland to Sweden to Seattle. Mr. Hermansson’s story offers vital insights into these groups’ tactics and their sometimes bizarre practices. During his time undercover, he hung out with heavily armed Holocaust deniers and attended gatherings where extremists drank mead from a traditional Viking horn and prayed to the Norse god Odin. In Charlottesville, he marched alongside hundreds of young neo-Nazis and white supremacists before he was sprayed with Mace by a counterprotester and witnessed the car attack that killed Heather Heyer. In Britain, Mr. Hermansson attended a private dinner of extremists where Greg Johnson, a reclusive leading American far-right figure who is editor in chief of Counter-Currents Publishing, explained the need to “mainstream this stuff — or, more precisely, we need to bring the mainstream towards us.” Mr. Johnson later expressed confidence that this process is working. “I see the upward curve in web traffic, and the upward trend in quality and quantity of younger people getting involved,” he told Mr. Hermansson in conversation captured on hidden-camera footage. (During that same chat, he said he believed in ethnic homelands and favored telling Jews, “You need to go to Israel or we’re going to freeze you out of our society.”) This goal of mainstreaming is an abiding fixation of the far right, whose members are well aware of the problems their movement has had with attracting young people in recent decades. At one point in Mr. Hermansson’s footage, Colin Robertson, a far-right YouTube personality who goes by the name Millennial Woes, explained to an older extremist the importance of putting forward a friendly, accessible face: “If we don’t appear like angry misfits, then we will end up making friendships with people who don’t agree with us,” he said. Some of Mr. Hermansson’s most arresting footage comes from a June meeting with Jason Reza Jorjani, a founder, along with the American white nationalist Richard Spencer and others, of the AltRight Corporation, an organization established to foster cooperation and coordination among alt-right groups in Europe and North America. Mr. Hermansson and Mr. Jorjani met at an Irish pub near the Empire State Building, where the baby-faced Mr. Jorjani imagined a near future in which, thanks to liberal complacency over the migration crisis, Europe re-embraces fascism: “We will have a Europe, in 2050, where the bank notes have Adolf Hitler, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great. And Hitler will be seen like that: like Napoleon, like Alexander, not like some weird monster who is unique in his own category — no, he is just going to be seen as a great European leader.” More shockingly, Mr. Jorjani bragged about his contacts in the American government. “We had connections in the Trump administration — we were going to do things!” he said at one point. “I had contacts with the Trump administration,” he said at another. “Our original vision was the alt-right would become like a policy group for the Trump administration,” he explained, and the administration figure “who was the interface was Steve Bannon.” Unfortunately, he told Mr. Hermansson, the political establishment was “disconnecting us from the Trump administration, almost completely.” (In June, Mr. Bannon hadn’t yet left the White House and returned to Breitbart, the popular and ardently pro-Trump far-right outlet he had led before his time working for Mr. Trump.) When I called Mr. Jorjani, he was cagier about his “connections” and “contacts” in the White House. All he meant, he said, was that he had been in touch with people who had a direct line to President Trump, though he wouldn’t say who. Asked to comment, a White House spokeswoman said, “We have no knowledge of any conversations or contact with this person.” Either way, Mr. Jorjani said, with the ousters of Michael Flynn in February and then Mr. Bannon in August, he now views the alt-right’s efforts to carve out a place in the White House as having failed. (Mr. Jorjani resigned from the AltRight Corporation in August.) If Mr. Jorjani wasn’t exaggerating to Mr. Hermansson, and he did have a relationship with White House officials, that would certainly be alarming. But even if he was exaggerating, it’s still important to understand how messages like his could travel from the far reaches of the right-wing internet and all the way into — or close to, at least — the White House. The extreme alt-right are benefiting immensely from the energy being produced by a more moderate — but still far-right — faction known as the “alt-light.” The alt-light promotes a slightly softer set of messages. Its figures — such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson and Mike Cernovich — generally frame their work as part of an effort to defend “the West” or “Western culture” against supposed left-liberal dominance, rather than making explicitly racist appeals. Many of them, in fact, have renounced explicit racism and anti-Semitism, though they will creep up to the line of explicitly racist speech, especially when Islam and immigration are concerned. This apparent moderation partly explains why they tend to have much bigger online audiences than even the most important alt-right figures — and why Hope Not Hate describes them as “less extreme, more dangerous.” Alt-light sites like Breitbart, formerly home to Mr. Yiannopoulos, as well as Prison Planet, where Mr. Watson is editor at large, draw millions of readers and are key nodes in a hyperkinetic network that is endlessly broadcasting viral-friendly far-right news, rumors and incitement. Fluent in the language of online irony and absurdism, and adept at producing successful memes, alt-lighters have pulled off something remarkable: They’ve made far-right ideas hip to a subset of young people, and framed themselves as society’s forgotten underdogs. The alt-light provides its audience easy scapegoats for their social, economic and sexual frustrations: liberals and feminists and migrants and, of course, globalists. The alt-light’s dedicated fan base runs into the millions. Mr. Watson has more than a million YouTube followers, for example, while Mr. Yiannopoulos has more than 2.3 million on Facebook. If even a tiny fraction of this base is drafted toward more extreme far-right politics, that would represent a significant influx into hate groups. According to researchers, the key to hooking new recruits into any movement, and to getting them increasingly involved over time, is to simply give them activities to participate in. This often precedes any deep ideological commitment on the recruits’ part and, especially early on, is more about offering them a sense of meaning and community than anything else. Intentionally or not, the far right has deftly applied these insights to the online world. Viewed through the filters of alt-light outlets like Breitbart and Prison Planet, or through Twitter feeds like Mr. Watson’s, the world is a horror show of crimes by migrants, leftist censorship and attacks on common sense. And the best, easiest way to fight back is through social media. The newly initiated are offered many opportunities to participate directly. A teenager in a suburban basement can join a coordinated global effort to spread misinformation about Emmanuel Macron, France’s centrist president, in the hopes of helping far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Anyone who wants to do so can help spread the word about supposed mainstream media censorship of the Muslim “crime wave” the far right says is ravaging Europe. These efforts — a click, a retweet, a YouTube comment — come to feel like important parts of an epochal struggle. The far right, once hemmed in by its own parochialism, has manufactured a worldwide online battlefield anyone with internet access can step into. And if you’re one of those newcomers happily playing the part of infantryman in the “meme wars” that rage daily, maybe, along the way, one of your new online Twitter buddies will say to you, “Milo’s O.K., but have you checked out this guy Greg Johnson?” Or maybe they’ll invite you to a closed online forum where ideas about how to protect Europe from Muslim migrants are discussed a bit more, well, frankly. Maybe, if you’re really lucky, you’ll eventually discover a whole new political movement to join. All of which can explain why members of the hard-core alt-right are watching the explosive success of their more moderate counterparts with open glee, unable to believe their good luck. “I’m just fighting less and less opposition to our sorts of ideas when they’re spoken,” Mr. Johnson, the Counter-Currents editor, told Mr. Hermansson. His optimism, unfortunately, appears to be well founded. OpinionLukas Hermsmeier",The New York Times
2017,Unemployment Is So 2009: Labor Shortage Gives Workers an Edge,"Economic Scene Is a new golden age for the American worker around the corner? For the last couple of years, workers’ median earnings have been rising on a sustained path not seen in years. This may come as a surprise after decades of wage stagnation, when the good jobs of an earlier industrial era — in which workers could go straight from high school to a lifelong place on the factory floor, with a pension on the other end — have largely disappeared, replaced in many cases by work with little security, uncertain hours and few if any benefits. Still, the wage picture is looking decidedly brighter. In 2008, in the midst of the recession, the average hourly pay of production and nonsupervisory workers tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics — those who toil at a cash register or on a shop floor — was 10 percent below its 1973 peak after accounting for inflation. Since then, wages have regained virtually all of that ground. Median wages for all full-time workers are rising at a pace last achieved in the dot-com boom at the end of the Clinton administration. And with employers adding more than two million jobs a year, some economists suspect that American workers — after being pummeled by a furious mix of globalization and automation, strangled by monetary policy that has restrained economic activity in the name of low inflation, and slapped around by government hostility toward unions and labor regulations — may finally be in for a break. But even as they forecast a brighter future for the working class, these economists also worry that the new age of tight labor markets and rising wages will create a different sort of challenge. As Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton University economist who was the chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama, put it, “We are heading for a labor shortage.” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, concurs. “Our problem going forward isn’t going to be unemployment,” he told me. “Over the next 20 to 25 years, a labor shortage is going to put a binding constraint on growth.” Converging factors are at play, Mr. Zandi contended. The Federal Reserve is likely to allow the economy to run “on the hot side.” Years of exceptionally low inflation have finally convinced the Fed to drop its overriding anti-inflationary bias, forged in the high-inflation era of President Jimmy Carter, and to put more weight on the impact that high interest rates have on employment. Manufacturing workers have probably already lost all the jobs to globalization that they were going to lose, Mr. Zandi said. Rather than “take” more American jobs, hundreds of millions of Chinese workers who have joined the global middle class over the last two decades will instead “create” jobs in the United States by buying American-made goods and services. And even as demand for workers accelerates across the United States, employers must contend with the unflinching force of demography: a work force that is growing at its slowest pace in over a half-century, as baby boomers who joined the labor force from the 1960s to the 1980s now gradually age out of it. More than seven years after the recession ended and the job market began to bounce back, only 60 percent of Americans over the age of 16 are working, about 2.5 percentage points fewer than just before the economy took a dive. On average, Mr. Zandi pointed out, aging will slice about a quarter of a percentage point from the labor-force participation rate — the share of Americans either employed or looking for a job — over the next 10 years. By the end of that period, the labor force may even be shrinking. Policy makers who spent their careers pondering the lackluster demand for workers will have to turn their attention to a problem they have not had to fret about much in at least a generation: how to pull more able-bodied people into the work force to offset a wave of retirements. “We have had real wage growth, but the labor supply has been flat for the last two years,” Professor Krueger said. “We get a very small number of workers back with higher wages, just enough to offset the people leaving the labor force because they are older.” The critical question for policy is what other tools are available to draw them back. And the answer requires removing a roadblock standing in the way of this potential golden age: Even if demand for workers is rising, it may not be for the kind of workers on offer, those sitting on the sidelines of the labor force. “The jobs in demand are more skilled than the workers we have,” Professor Krueger told me. The share of men in their prime working years — 25 to 54 — who are in the labor force has declined steadily since the end of World War II. Workers without a college degree have clocked out at increasing rates, as imports and automation undercut their wages. For years, the economy hardly noticed because women were rushing to work in droves, offsetting the retreat among men. But that trend faded around the turn of the century. Since then, the labor-force participation rate of prime-age Americans has shrunk to nearly the lowest in the industrialized world. And, as Professor Krueger noted, once workers stop looking for a job, it is tough to draw them back in. “After they leave the labor market,” he said, “people reorganize their lives.” Indeed. A third of the prime-age workers who have left the labor force are now receiving disability benefits, meaning they are out for good, Professor Krueger estimated. Another 20 percent are in the process of applying for such benefits. In a recently released study, he estimated that about a third of prime-age men not in the labor force use prescription painkillers, namely opiates, suggesting that they will not be returning to work soon. Professor Krueger suggests that the increase in opioid prescriptions could account for about 20 percent of the decline in men’s labor-force participation from 1999 to 2015, and 25 percent of the observed decline in women’s labor-force participation. How to get them back? In a coming study, Melissa Kearney and Katharine Abraham of the University of Maryland identify forces that have pushed workers out of the labor force before the retirement age of 65. Trade is at the top of the list, followed by technology — be it robots or other forms of automation — and disability insurance, which offers people some income in the absence of a job. Supply-side factors — incarceration, or the effect of the minimum wage on labor costs — are next. Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham also identify policies that might draw more workers back into jobs: Improving access to high-quality education, an elusive goal despite recent gains, is critical to equip students to navigate a changing workplace. So is access to child care, to lower barriers to women’s participation in the work force. Expanding wage supports like the earned-income tax credit will be important to make work worthwhile for workers of lesser skills. On the supply side, Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham suggest that being cautious about raising the minimum wage, which could price some workers out of jobs, and reforming disability insurance to encourage recipients to seek jobs. There is more. Discouraging the overprescription of painkillers seems like an obvious choice, given Professor Krueger’s findings. There is also a clear list of things not to be done. For instance, restricting immigration is not the smartest policy when workers are scarce. Raising barriers to imports — inviting retaliation from trading partners — is exactly the wrong approach, especially now that the workers in cheap labor markets that put such pressure on American jobs promise to become big consumers of things made in America. If the goal is to protect economic growth and to give American workers a shot at a new golden age of employment, closing the door on the world economy is not the solution.",The New York Times
2017,Unesco World Heritage Sites 2017 Picks Range From Eritrea to England,"Trending Unesco annually expands its list of World Heritage Sites, and this year’s class of inductees, announced in July, offers both stimulation for travelers, with a rich and varied group of intriguing sites, and a reminder, especially with its remote and more vulnerable picks, that the list itself is not about tourism. The World Heritage program aims to identify and protect cultural and natural sites around the world that demonstrate “outstanding value to humanity,” according to its website. Those spots sometimes constitute the most sought-after destinations for global travel: the Great Wall of China, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru. Others, though, are more obscure or hard to reach or both, including three members of the class of 2017: Okinoshima, a sacred island in Japan; Dauria, a wild landscape shared by Mongolia and Russia; and Asmara, the capital of Eritrea in East Africa. Okinoshima, for example, is off limits to women, per ancient practice. But it is the inclusion of Asmara, cited by Unesco for its modernist architecture dating to its era as an Italian colony, that is perhaps the most controversial choice. Eritrea is the subject of a U.S. State Department travel warning noting that the government restricts travel of foreigners to Asmara. The United Nations has accused Eritrea’s government of crimes against humanity, including enslavement and murder. “Asmara’s mix of local and Italian influences of the 1920s and ’30s is incredible. But it’s very isolated,” politically and geographically, said Tom Hall, the editorial director for Lonely Planet, the travel media company. The ancient city of Hebron, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was another controversial choice, thanks to its inclusion as a Palestinian World Heritage Site. In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel described the decision as “delusional.” Many more of the 21 new inductees, spread among 18 cultural sites and three natural ones, are more easily accessible and without controversy. At least one, the Lake District of northwestern England, is well loved, receiving over 18 million visitors a year. Unesco noted “the combined work of nature and human activity” in the region, including sheep farming on deforested hillsides, stone villages and grand country estates. “What makes it so beautiful and dramatic is a lot of it is pretty barren,” said Janel Jensen, the Europe program manager for REI, which runs a nine-day walking trip, May to October, that includes hiking in the Lake District (from $4,199 a person). “You get an uninterrupted panorama of hills, valleys, lakes and streams.” Tour operators working in Iran lauded the inclusion of Yazd, a remote city in the central Iranian plateau that developed an underground water system and maintains its traditional Persian architecture and Zoroastrian temples. “In terms of architecture, original temples, gardens and mosques, a lot of things are traditional and intact,” said Annie Lucas, the vice president of Mir Corporation, which guides trips in Iran. Ms. Lucas reported that Iran has recently resumed issuing travel visas to Americans, which were halted earlier this year, seemingly in response to President Trump’s travel ban. Mir’s 12-day trip to Tehran, Shiraz, Isfahan and Yazd starts at $5,995 a person. In French Polynesia, Taputapuatea, an ancient ceremonial site on Raiatea Island, also made the list. Oceania Cruises offers an excursion to the site on several South Pacific itineraries including a 12-day cruise departing from Tahiti on Feb. 13 (from $3,149 a person). Other new inductees include Aphrodisias, a third-century Greco-Roman archaeological site in southwestern Turkey; the temples of Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia, extolled for their forest setting and lack of crowds; Los Alerces National Park in Argentina, noted for protecting some of the last stands of native Patagonian forest; and the 19th-century Valongo Wharf in Rio de Janeiro, where slaves were traded. “The Valongo Wharf in Rio tells a story that’s powerful,” said Jonny Bealby, the founder of Wild Frontiers, a travel company devoted to off-the-beaten path trips. “It reminds us of the story of humanity and, good or bad, gives us a sense of our history.” The 15th-century walled city of Ahmedabad, the former capital of the Gujarat state of India, also made the list. “Few tourists go there,” said Catherine Heald, the co-founder and chief executive of Remote Lands, which has been guiding trips to the city, known for its textiles, forts and winding streets for over 11 years. An article last Sunday about Unesco heritage sites referred incorrectly to the Indian city of Ahmedabad. It is the former capital of Gujarat state — not the current capital, which is Gandhinagar.",The New York Times
2017,Uneven Pliskova Battles Back to Advance to 4th Round Against Brady,"As Zhang Shuai stepped to the baseline, needing one good serve to knock off Karolina Pliskova, the world’s No. 1 player, she did so with experience. In 2009, when she was ranked 226th, Zhang defeated the No. 1 player at the time, Dinara Safina, in a shocking upset at the China Open in Beijing. Like Safina, Pliskova is a top-ranked player who has never won a Grand Slam event, adding more pressure to the moment, especially in such an early round. “I know all the opponents are behind me,” Pliskova said of the rankings, “so I should win every match, which is tough.” Facing a match point against her after almost two sets of uneven tennis, Pliskova moved to her right knowing that she had converted only two successful forehands down the line to that point. But with her tennis fortunes hanging in the balance and all the pressure of failing to live up to her lofty ranking, Pliskova had little choice but to go for broke. Without hesitation, she drew her racket back on the move and hammered a piercing forehand down the line. Zhang, now ranked 26th, could not handle it, and the shot heard ’round Arthur Ashe Stadium changed the third-round match. And it might shape the outcome of the women’s draw. A finalist at last year’s Open, Pliskova capitalized on that pivotal forehand to win, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, to avoid what would have been a crushing defeat. “I didn’t have any other choice,” she said of the decision to go down the line. “I just went through it and prayed that it’s going to be in. And it was in.” Her victory set up a fourth-round matchup against Jennifer Brady, a 22-year-old American. Brady, who earned a spot in the round of 16 this year at the Australian Open in her debut appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, defeated Monica Niculescu, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (3), on a lively Court 17. Brady joined the No. 20 seed CoCo Vandeweghe as two of four Americans on Saturday’s card to advance. Vandeweghe showed continued seasoning under her new coach, Pat Cash, to beat No. 10 Agnieszka Radwanska, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4. She will play the unseeded Lucie Safarova in the fourth round. Shelby Rogers, from South Carolina, lost to No. 4 Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, 6-4, 7-5. No. 15 Madison Keys closed out a long day at the Open with 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over No. 17 Elena Vesnina, which ended at 1:46 a.m. Five American women are in the round of 16, the most since 2002. The qualifier Kaia Kanepi, ranked 418th, reached the fourth round of a major for the first time since 2014 with a 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 victory over Naomi Osaka. Kanepi, 32, has missed much of the last two years with plantar fasciitis, and the Open is only her fourth tournament this season. On Monday, Kanepi will play Daria Kasatkina, who upset 12th-seeded Jelena Ostapenko, 6-3, 6-2. Brady, a former star at U.C.L.A., has never played Pliskova or faced a No. 1 player. In light of how Pliskova struggled in her second-round win against Nicole Gibbs and again on Saturday — including getting treatment for a sore right forehand — questions are emerging about the No. 1 seed’s inconsistent level of play. “I play good shots, good rallies, and then there is hundreds of mistakes and not a good shot,” Pliskova said. Pliskova, who lost to Angelique Kerber in the final here last year after beating Serena Williams in a semifinal, said her arm felt sore in the second set, but it improved after further treatment following the match and was not a concern. But something was affecting her serve, normally one of her most potent weapons. She won only 57 percent of the points on her first serve, and she had no aces in the third set. That was not how she played a year ago to reach her only Grand Slam final. “You just want to play that good again,” Pliskova said. “I don’t feel like I’m playing that good again, but I’m still in the draw, actually, so I’m not going to be that sad.” Brady knows she is not expected to beat Pliskova, but she vowed to enjoy the experience, just as she did against Niculescu on Court 17. With most of the fans there supporting her, Brady, who was originally from Harrisburg, Pa., before her family moved to Boca Raton, Fla., said the atmosphere reminded her of a typical match at U.C.L.A., where she played for two years before turning professional in 2015. At one point she fell to the court and just stayed there for an extended moment to recuperate from a taxing, competitive match, much like a college student’s reaction to an early-morning alarm clock. “I was just, like, ‘I don’t want to get up and play right now,’” she said, and added: “I like it down here on the ground. I was tired, and laying there felt nice. Yeah, it was a tough match mentally and physically. I felt like in that moment I kind of just was, like, yeah.” Brady is ranked 91st on the WTA tour, and she will need to be at her best to win — unless Pliskova is at her worst. “On paper, I’m not supposed to win this match,” Brady said. “I’ll just go out there and compete and have fun.” An article in some editions on Sunday about Karolina Pliskova’s third-round victory over Zhang Shuai at the United States Open misstated, in some copies, the score for the second set. Pliskova won it 7-5, not 6-5.",The New York Times
2017,"Unilever to Buy Carver, Korean Cosmetics Company, in Bid for Asian Growth","In its pursuit of growth, Unilever is moving away from mayonnaise and toward makeup. The latest sign of the company’s shift from stalwart products came Monday, when Unilever announced plans to buy Carver Korea, an Asian skin care specialist, for 2.27 billion euros, or $2.7 billion. The deal also highlights how aggressively the British-Dutch conglomerate is pushing to expand in Asia, where the skin care market has been growing quickly. By Unilever’s estimates, South Korea is the fourth-biggest skin care market in the world. And the country’s beauty sales could reach as much as $13 billion in sales this year, according to the research company Mintel. Perhaps more important, Korean beauty products have growing fan bases in other major markets like China and Japan. Unilever struck its acquisition despite the geopolitical frost that has descended onto the relationship between Beijing and Seoul. Some Korean skin care manufacturers have suffered from China’s halting group tours into South Korea, amid anger over that country’s deploying an antimissile shield to guard against North Korea. Within the Asian beauty products industry, Carver has become one of the most popular manufacturers around. Its A.H.C. line of products stretches from moisturizers to eye creams to sunblock. “It is an impressive business that is completely aligned to our personal care strategy,” Alan Jope, the president of Unilever’s personal care business, said of Carver. “A.H.C. has been strongly gaining popularity thanks to its efficacious, innovative and premium products, and it therefore offers great opportunities for growth.” Among Unilever’s main focuses in recent years has been personal care, which is the company’s biggest sales category. The division collected €20.2 billion in revenue last year, or about 38 percent of the conglomerate’s overall sales. But Unilever has come under increasing scrutiny over its ability to grow, especially after the company spurned a $143 billion takeover bid by Kraft Heinz in February. Weeks later, it said it would undergo a major restructuring, review its dual legal structure and carry out a hefty stock buyback to appease investors. The company, which makes products like Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Lipton tea, has sought to shrink its exposure to slow-growth commodity businesses like food spreads, a line of products that it is in the process of selling. Under the direction of its chief executive, Paul Polman, Unilever has made acquisitions a central part of its strategy. “They help preserve our market position in attractive segments where we can bring our global scale and local strengths to bear,” the company said in its most recent annual report. “They also bring us disruptive business models and business styles that are entrepreneurial, helping transform our business culture.” In recent years, Unilever has acquired Dollar Shave Club, the men’s shaving darling, as well as the skin care product makers Murad and Dermalogica to help expand its premium offerings. Unilever is buying Carver from its current owners, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs, who bought the beauty care specialist in 2016. That year, according to Unilever, the Korean company reported €321 million in sales and €137 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. “This has been a great opportunity for us to partner with a leading Korean company in an exciting segment of the cosmetics space and to help support its brand, operations and growth around the world,” Ed Han, a managing director at Bain Capital, said in a statement.",The New York Times

2017,United Kingdom,"Wordplay SUNDAY PUZZLE — For about a month, my dog, Jade — known to most as The Extremely Spunky Border terrier, or ESBT — enjoyed an unusual friendship. Border terriers were bred to rid their Scottish ancestors’ households of rodents, and they still “go to ground,” as it is called, but Jade has never shown any particular interest in her genetic lot. She’s a lover, not a fighter, so when the rabbit came knocking, Jade’s reaction was: “Cool! Another four-legged friend to play with!” We see a lot of rabbits in the spring in my area, so it’s often hard to distinguish one bunny from another. One in particular, however, seemed to sense a kindred spirit in Jade, so when the family would forage in my yard, it would lag behind just enough to get Jade’s attention from her bed near the glass door. Jade would beg to be let out and they would chase each other around the yard. When the rabbit had enough, it would duck under our fence to rejoin its family, but it always returned to play with its new friend. This worried me, because while Jade seemed committed to being a peacenik, her genes could have beckoned to her at any time. And I put myself squarely in the “No dead animal ‘gifts’ from the backyard” camp. One day, while the rabbit was leading a merry chase around the yard, it stopped to catch its breath. This is it, I fretted. This is where it ends for this poor bunny. Amazingly, Jade’s self-control kicked in: When the rabbit froze in its tracks to pant, Jade froze in her own tracks and politely waited for her friend to recover, whereupon they resumed their game. Would that we all had that kind of compassion. And I learned not to second-guess the wisdom of the ESBT. The next morning, I came downstairs to let Jade out and the rabbit was sitting in front of the door, waiting for its friend. And every day for a whole month, those two friends, who couldn’t have been more different, played beautifully together. We haven’t seen the rabbit for a while. I hope it’s O.K. and has perhaps moved on to start its own family. But it will always be a reminder that, in addition to her own family, some bunny loved Jade. Andrew Zhou returns today to unite various species from the animal kingdom by using the scientific principles of ANIMAL MAGNETISM, as the revealer at 110A informs us. To make the theme easier to find, the theme clues are starred, and the squares that contain the two animals are shaded or circled, depending on where you are solving. For example, at 23A, the answer to “*Law enforcer with the Coast Guard” is BOARDING OFFICER, which unites a BOAR and a DINGO. BOARDING OFFICER was not familiar to me, but it’s a thing you can train to do with the Coast Guard. Similarly, and I don’t think I would be overstating things by saying that this sounds like the most interesting date on record, 48A’s “*Philosopher who wrote ‘Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made’” is IMMANUEL KANT, which introduces an ELK to an ANT. In nontheme news, Mr. Zhou debuts a whopping 14 entries today, five of which are theme entries, and that’s pretty impressive. I found myself going back after the solve to actually look for the animal pairings, which detracted from the enjoyment of the solve somewhat. Also, I briefly confused myself by getting GOOD WILL AMBASSADORS at 66A and thinking that the animal that I needed to look for was a BASS, not the LAMB and the ASS. ■ 14A: “Happy event after a split?” sounds like an oxymoron, but not if you are thinking about bowling and knocking off a SPARE. ■ 44A: “Little sucker?” is a STRAW in today’s puzzle, but if you are drinking Boba tea, you definitely want a wider straw. ■ 54A: Misdirection alert! “Company known for combining expertise?” sounds as if it refers to a business that combines knowledge, but we’re supposed to be thinking about farming in this clue. The John DEERE company makes combines for harvesting. ■ 65A: Some people tuck their kids into bed, and some people put a SEED in a garden bed. Some do both. But when you’re solving a puzzle, it’s important to think about the different ways that words can be used. ■ 106A: Well, that escalated quickly. “Tie up quickly?” for ELOPE sounds stressful to say the least, but I think this has something to do with “tying the knot.” ■ 4D: ORRERY sounds like a fancy word, but you have, in all likelihood, made one. Remember those foam ball models of the solar system you made for science class? That’s an ORRERY. ■ 12D: More misdirection! Think about different kinds of “calls” and “charges.” “Call with a charge?” sounds like a phone call, but today it’s not; it’s the call OLÉ, which can occur after the charge of a bull during a bull fight. ■ 34D: Yes, this is a play on words having to do with the fact that people who follow RASTAfarianism wear their hair in dreadlocks as part of their religious beliefs. “Person who’s dreaded?” is not a judgment. ■ 46D: “First sign of spring” could well be the buds on the trees or the emergence of crocuses, but today we’re thinking about zodiac signs, and ARIES is the first sign that occurs during spring. ■ 67D: “Heat center of old?” is Shaquille O’NEAL, who used to be with the Miami Heat. ■ 107D: An EGOT is when a performer has won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. Who ISN’T captivated by stories of unusual animal friendships? This list of theme entries took a while to get right (and still, only a few weeks ago, I realized STEPHEN HAWKING’s name also has this property). The original submission contained DRONESTAGRAM, an Instagram-type site for aerial photos, but for Will, it was less “three’s company” than “three’s a crowd.” Upon revision, which required nearly the whole puzzle to be razed, interesting entries like 55-across presented themselves — I dedicate that to all my friends who attended this fine institution. Many are musicians, composers, and puzzlers, incidentally. I learned about 107D (EGOT) from “30 Rock,” produced by 20D (LORNE Michaels). 78D has a property that I hope will cause some solvers to consider 96A (You might pass one in a race) to be BACON. 119A came up in the revision; after I emailed Will about greenlighting its usage, he replied: “SNOT-NOSED is a little rude, so it’s something I would try not to use. Still, if it makes for the best fill, go ahead.” On that note, I wish you all a peaceful and enjoyable long weekend. And you as well, Mr. Zhou. Let’s wrap this up with some more warm fuzzies before we start a new week: Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2017,"United Nations, Facebook, Hamas: Your Monday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • World leaders gather in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly. We’ll be watching their posturing on climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, atrocities in Myanmar and North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. Many of the leaders will be scrutinizing President Trump, who is set to deliver his first centerpiece speech there tomorrow. For Nikki Haley, the American envoy, the week will be a test of how much influence she has among her peers and on Mr. Trump. Here’s a brief explainer of the gathering’s significance and the U.N.’s broader challenges. _____ • Britain lowered its terrorism threat level, a day after the police arrested a second man late Saturday in connection with a bombing in a London subway station that left 29 people injured. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for Friday’s crude bombing attack, which was the fifth terrorist attack in the country this year. “It’s really important that we show business as usual rather than allow terrorists to disrupt our way of life and stop us doing what we’re doing,” said Sadiq Khan, the mayor, as London Fashion Week began on the day of the bombing with a defiant shrug. Above, armed police officers outside a Scottish Premiership soccer match in Glasgow on Saturday. _____ • Arrivals of migrants in Italy have plunged in recent months, leading some to charge that the government in Rome was paying off Libya’s warlords, condemning migrants to misery in militant-run detention centers there. Italian officials denied such payments and said that they had instead resorted to diplomacy. “We approached the issue slowly, slowly, Italian style,” a deputy foreign minister said. “We spoke to everyone.” Separately, Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, announced his intention to lead his center-right party’s ballot again in the next elections. _____ • A clash is brewing between America’s tech giants and an increasing number of governments worried about the companies’ influence and reach. Many regulators are mimicking Europe’s stance on digital privacy, using tougher rules to control how parts of the internet are run. Our correspondents looked at how Facebook, which is used by more than two billion people each month, tries to win over wary regulators. “Ultimately, it’s a grand power struggle,” said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet. Our media columnist argues that Facebook should reveal more about what it knows about Russian interference in last year’s U.S. presidential election. Today, the European Commission is expected to publish a list of options for taxing technology companies. _____ • Across the world, more people are now obese than underweight. Western food companies like Nestlé are aggressively expanding in developing nations, contributing to a new epidemic of diabetes and heart disease, chronic illnesses that are fed by soaring rates of obesity in places that struggled with hunger and malnutrition just a generation ago. • New technologies are testing the limits of computer semiconductors. To deal with that, researchers are taking design cues from human brains. • Rolling Stone, the magazine that was once a bible for the counterculture, is going up for sale on the eve of its 50th anniversary. • Dogecoin was meant to poke fun at the hype around virtual currencies. But investors didn’t get the joke and bought it anyway, bringing its market value as high as $400 million. • Recent U.S. statistics have been rosy. But look farther back, and you’ll find a 50-year decline in men’s lifetime earnings. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • In Myanmar, a new generation of Rohingya Muslims is being radicalized by persecution and an apartheidlike existence in the Buddhist-majority country. Above, a Rohingya imam who says he is a militant, at a refugee camp in Bangladesh. [The New York Times] • Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, said it had agreed to talks with the rival Fatah movement to form a unity government and hold general elections.

On this day in 1973, Jimmy Carter, then governor of Georgia, filled out a report saying that he had seen a U.F.O. It wasn’t such a strange statement at the time — a Gallup poll that year found that 51 percent of people interviewed believed in unidentified flying objects, and that 11 percent believed they had seen “a flying saucer” themselves. Mr. Carter filed his report with the unofficial National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and said he had seen the object in Leary, Ga., in 1969. Decades later, he recounted the incident on CNN: “I and about 25 others saw something in the air that changed colors and was round and came and left. We couldn’t figure out what it was.” But he added that he believed it was impossible “to have space people from other planets or other stars” come to Earth. While he didn’t believe they could visit us, Mr. Carter did record a message for “possible unknown civilizations in the galaxies” as president. It was part of the golden record placed in the Voyager in August 1977. He said it represented “our hope and our determination, our good will in the vast and awesome universe.” Karen Zraick contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2017,"United Nations, Hurricane Maria, Martin Schulz: Your Tuesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • As world leaders converged in New York for their annual gathering at the U.N., President Trump said the international body had grown too bureaucratic and ineffective, but gave no clue as to whether he would cut U.S. funding. Mr. Trump also made a veiled threat to pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement and said that his Bastille Day visit to Paris inspired him to consider staging a Fourth of July military parade back at home. He is expected to stress “sovereignty and accountability” rather than joint action on global crises in his address to the U.N. General Assembly today. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel are also giving speeches. Check back for our live coverage. _____ • Hurricane Maria is gathering pace as it sweeps across the Caribbean, prompting one resident to ask, “When will all of the hurricanes stop?” Above, a nearly deserted street in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe. Our reporter set out to answer questions on links between climate change and extreme weather. At the U.N., Gary Cohn, the top White House economic adviser, told ministers from several major allies that the Trump administration would pull out of the Paris climate deal unless it was revised. Some U.S. governors are also in New York this week, assuring European and other officials that they remain committed to the goals of the accord. _____ • On Sunday, German voters are widely expected to endorse Chancellor Angela Merkel in general elections. That raises the question of what happened to her contender, Martin Schulz, whose chances of unseating her appear to have fizzled. Some analysts said that Mr. Schulz should have put more emphasis on his tenure as president of the European Parliament and less on his experience as a mayor. Mr. Schulz says he still has a chance. Here’s an extended interview with a local newsmagazine. _____ • “Boris is Boris.” That was the reaction of Theresa May, the British prime minister, to a 4,000-word essay by Boris Johnson, her foreign secretary, last week in which he staked out a hard-line position on the country’s departure from the European Union. The article has reignited a fierce debate ahead of a policy speech by Mrs. May on “Brexit” on Friday, in which she is expected to strike a conciliatory tone, and the Conservatives’ party conference next month. Above, Mrs. May in Canada, where she had talks mostly on trade with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. She is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly tomorrow. _____ • In Washington, our correspondents explored the aggressive tactics used by the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation into Russian attempts to disrupt last year’s presidential election. Above, Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the inquiry. Meanwhile, one of our reporters overheard two of the president’s lawyers clash at a popular Washington steakhouse over how much they should cooperate with the investigation. _____ • We asked experts to judge some advanced economies’ health care systems by their quality, sustainability and reach.

North Korea’s economic output might be smaller than Vermont’s, but in the production of one thing the reclusive country recently outpaced the entire United States: tungsten. It’s a rare metal whose price has surged 50 percent since July. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, at 3,422 degrees Celsius, making it useful in light bulbs. Smartphone makers need tungsten because it helps withstand electronic heat in touchscreens. Armed forces need it for its ability to harden the steel used in missiles. Automakers use 25 percent of the global supply for their cutting tools. Most of the world’s tungsten comes from China, where the government has been exerting greater control over production, in part because domestic demand has ballooned. The country makes more cars than the U.S. and Japan combined. The U.S. has had concerns about the increasing price of the rare metal since at least the 1960s. A London-trained American-Chinese citizen, K.C. Li, was credited with first trading the mineral in the U.S. His Wah Chang Corporation was established in New York in 1916.

2017,"United Nations, Hurricane Maria, Rohingya: Your Wednesday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “If the righteous many don’t confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph.” In a bellicose speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, referred to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man,” denounced the Iran nuclear agreement and promised to “crush the loser terrorists” in the Middle East. He thanked Russia and China for supporting recent U.N. sanctions on North Korea, but also indirectly criticized them, calling it “an outrage” that “some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world.” Here are the highlights of the opening day of speeches. Leaders from Japan and Myanmar speak today; South Korea, Russia, China and Indonesia tomorrow; Australia on Friday; and the Philippines and Singapore on Saturday. _____ • In a special session at the U.N., the leaders of island nations appealed for a reconception of humanitarian aid in dealing with climate change. “Forces far beyond our control have pushed us to this dire situation,” said the leader of Antigua and Barbuda, which was devastated by Hurricane Irma. Hurricane Maria, the third major hurricane to sweep through the Caribbean in recent weeks, inflicted “mind boggling” damage on Dominica and is expected to approach the already devastated Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today. Martinique, above, suffered power outages but was largely unscathed. _____ • Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar, avoided any criticism of the country’s military in her much-anticipated speech in the capital, Naypyidaw, addressing the plight of the country’s Rohingya ethnic minority. A stark satellite analysis by Human Rights Watch shows that at least 210 Rohingya villages have been burned to the ground since late August, sending hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fleeing into Bangladesh with accounts of a vast military campaign of killing and rape. Britain suspended aid to the country’s military. _____ • Australia is reeling from the flu. More than 166,000 cases have already been reported, a sharp increase from 91,000 for all of last year. At least 72 people have died, raising questions about Australians’ own “grin and bear it” resilience and the effectiveness of a health care system that fails to vaccinate more than 90 percent of children for flu. _____ • The special counsel inquiry into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election is opting for aggressive tactics. Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, woke up one morning in July to find federal agents with a search warrant had picked the lock of his home and raided it. • Toys “R” Us, one of the world’s largest toy store chains, has filed for bankruptcy protection, but the proceedings are not expected to affect that company’s operations in Australia or Asia. • Norway’s sovereign wealth fund hit $1 trillion for the first time; its sheer size has made it challenging to find markets big enough to invest in. • New U.S. figures show that the number of international visitors to the U.S. dropped by close to 700,000 in the first quarter of 2017, a loss of nearly $2.7 billion in spending. • The iPhone 8 feels like a “swan song,” our tech columnist writes — a worthy, final refinement before the iPhone X and the prospect of a new generation of smartphones. • U.S. stocks were slightly up.

2017,"United Nations, Mexico, Hurricane Maria: Your Wednesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump made a bellicose debut speech at the United Nations, threatening to “totally destroy” North Korea and referring to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man.” He called the Iran nuclear deal “an embarrassment,” promised to “crush the loser terrorists” in the Middle East and said the U.S. was prepared to confront Venezuela’s authoritarian government. (Here’s the video.) Our White House correspondent noted a dissonance between Mr. Trump’s vision of renewed sovereignty of the nation state and his threats to act aggressively against some countries. _____ • Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said that the nuclear deal with Iran was “essential for peace” and that his country would “not close any door to dialogue” with North Korea. (Here’s the video, in French.) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel agreed with Mr. Trump’s assessment of Iran. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey called for more financial assistance for sheltering more than three million Syrian refugees. Among today’s speakers: the presidents of the European Council, Iran and the Palestinian Authority and the prime ministers of Britain, Italy and Japan. _____ • Mexico was hit with a 7.1-magnitude earthquake, just two weeks after it was struck by its most powerful tremor in a century. At least 216 people were killed. Millions poured into the streets and remained there, fearful of returning inside. Images show crushed cars and falling facades. The quake came on the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 quake that killed as many as 10,000 people. _____ • Hurricane Maria left “mind-boggling” damage on the Caribbean island nation of Dominica and in Guadeloupe, the French overseas territory. The Category 5 storm is expected to approach the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today. Here’s a map of its projected path.

2017,United Technologies Makes an Expensive Purchase to Gain Scale,"Breakingviews United Technologies isn’t staying fully grounded in its quest for scale. The industrial conglomerate is paying $30 billion, including debt, for aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins. The strategy makes sense but, with a weak return on investment, United Technologies is paying up for the privilege of getting bigger. The deal, whose $23 billion equity value is a roughly 18 percent premium to the price of Rockwell Collins stock before news of a possible sale emerged a month ago, was widely anticipated last week. Reuters Breakingviews’ estimate of the likely annual cost savings came close to the $500 million promoted in the official release Monday. Taxed at 30 percent and capitalized on a multiple of 10, these are worth $3.5 billion — just a hair more than the deal premium, before allowing for transaction costs and the four years it will take to realize the savings in full. That makes financial sense. The overall return, though, isn’t so compelling. Analysts on average expect Rockwell to make $1.7 billion in earnings before interest and tax in the coming 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters data. Add the cost savings and tax the total profit, and the return on the full price, including $7 billion of Rockwell net debt, barely tops 5 percent. That’s well short of Rockwell’s weighted average cost of capital of 8.4 percent, as calculated by Morningstar. United Technologies chopped more costs out of its last big acquisition, of Goodrich for $16.5 billion in 2012, than it originally promised. Yet justifying the Rockwell Collins purchase needs more. Pricing power with customers like Boeing and Airbus could be one source of value, but if that’s a real factor the deal will face stiff opposition from those companies. So might cross-selling more systems and parts, although revenue generation like that is much more easily hoped for than delivered. Another way to keep shareholders happy might be a future breakup, and adding bulk in aerospace could make that easier. Carving out the climate-control and elevator arms of United Technologies would be a logical step, though on Tuesday executives didn’t sound as if they were in any hurry to do that. A 4 percent drop in the $90 billion company’s stock in trading on Tuesday morning underlines the need for elusive revenue benefits or a lucrative breakup to prove the deal’s potential.",The New York Times
2017,United Technologies to Buy Rockwell Collins in $30 Billion Deal,"United Technologies has agreed to buy the airplane parts maker Rockwell Collins for $30 billion, including debt, establishing an industrial giant and cementing one of the largest deals ever in the aerospace industry. Under the terms of the deal, United Technologies — a deeply diverse business that includes the Otis escalator and elevator brands and Pratt & Whitney, which makes high-performance aircraft engines — will pay $140 a share in cash and stock, both companies said late Monday. Rockwell investors will receive $93.33 a share in cash and the remaining $46.67 in United Technologies stock. The price is an 18 percent premium above where Rockwell’s stock was traded on Aug. 3, a day before news reports said United Technologies was considering a bid for Rockwell. Shares of United Technologies fell on the news. In midday trading on Monday, shares were down 4.5 percent, dragging the Dow Jones industrial average 0.8 percent lower. Rockwell Collins was trading 0.8 percent higher. Buying Rockwell — which produces electronics and avionics for aircraft, including the F-35 fighter jet — would complement United Technologies’ offerings without any overlap. It also would give the firm more negotiating leverage over the airplane makers Boeing and Airbus. A deal for Rockwell, which is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, would also help United gird itself against rivals such as Honeywell International. “This acquisition adds tremendous capabilities to our aerospace businesses and strengthens our complementary offerings of technologically advanced aerospace systems,” United Technologies’ chairman, Gregory J. Hayes, said in a statement. The transaction is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018. Shares of Rockwell Collins, which has a market value of $21.2 billion, have risen 9.8 percent in the last month. United Technologies, which has a market cap of $94.2 billion, has slid 2.9 percent in the same period. United Technologies, which is based in Farmington, Conn., has long sought growth through acquisitions. In 2012, it acquired Goodrich for $18 billion. But United rejected a deal with Honeywell International last year, saying that regulators were likely to block it because of antitrust rules. Last year, in another large aerospace deal, Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway acquired Precision Castparts, which produces parts for aerospace suppliers, for $37 billion including debt.",The New York Times
2017,United Technologies’ Deal for Rockwell Collins Faces Skepticism,"Buying Rockwell Collins for $23 billion — one of the biggest deals in the history of the aerospace industry, uniting two major manufacturers — was meant to be a crowning achievement for United Technologies. Instead, investors and customers appeared to be deeply skeptical of the blockbuster takeover. Never mind that the combined company would have more than $60 billion in sales. Or that its stable of products would include nearly every piece of a plane, from Pratt & Whitney jet engines to cockpit parts, seats and even in-flight entertainment units. Shares in United Technologies dropped nearly 6 percent on Tuesday after the deal was announced. The plunge contributed to a drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, of which United Technologies is a component. And both Boeing and Airbus, two of the companies’ main customers, expressed doubt about the benefits of the union. “We are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of — or add value to — our customers and industry,” Boeing said in a statement. That has left United Technologies to defend a merger that company executives argue creates the largest supplier of aerospace components in the world, capable of delivering both lower-cost parts and innovations. Skeptics appeared to believe that the deal, which may be a prelude to a breakup of the industrial conglomerate years down the road, was an expensive proposition with few clear benefits. Shareholders of United Technologies are instead being asked to accept a halt to share buybacks for the next three to four years, while the company may take a hit to its credit rating. The agreement comes on the heels of a big deal by Rockwell Collins itself: the $8.3 billion takeover of B/E Aerospace, a manufacturer of seats and other interior plane parts. Much of the early speculation about the deal, including from analysts, was that United Technologies planned to spin off its commercial unit, which includes Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners. That invited comparisons to other mergers that functioned in large part as a reshuffling of corporate assets. Dow Chemical and DuPont recently closed their $130 billion merger, a transaction explicitly designed to lead to a breakup of the chemical giant into three smaller businesses. And when Pfizer announced an agreement to buy a fellow drug maker, Allergan, in late 2015, it said that it, too, would consider some sort of corporate split several years afterward. (Pfizer later called off the proposed transaction.) But United Technologies’ chief executive, Gregory J. Hayes, stressed on Tuesday that talk of a corporate breakup was premature. In fact, he said, United Technologies will need the revenue from all of the combined operations’ businesses to pay down the debt that the transaction will incur. But if United Technologies’ stock price lags several years down the line, a potential breakup would be on the table. “I’ve committed to looking at every strategic option out there,” Mr. Hayes said in a telephone interview. In the meantime, he said, putting United Technologies and Rockwell Collins together will yield some $500 million in cost savings. And it will provide customers with a one-stop shop for airplane components that is more efficient and capable of technological advancement. In particular, Mr. Hayes and Kelly Ortberg, Rockwell’s chief executive, spoke about how planes are becoming more digital. Uniting the companies, they argued, will lead to better ways of making the products that future planes will need. Analysts said combining the two companies made enormous sense on a basic level. One, Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley, described the deal on a conference call with analysts as “the logical deal of the decade.” Mr. Hayes, on a call with analysts, joked that his eye had been on Rockwell Collins for more than 30 years, since he was an executive at Sundstrand Aerospace, which merged with United Technologies in 1999. He spoke more sincerely about the long and storied history of the two companies. Goodrich, which United Technologies bought five years ago, made the spacesuits worn on the Mercury space missions. And Collins made the radios that Neil Armstrong used to tell Earth about his first steps on the moon. The deal is unlikely to run into antitrust issues, because the two companies have little overlap in their product portfolios. United Technologies said it anticipated closing the transaction next fall. But many analysts added that the price seemed rich. United Technologies agreed to pay $140 a share in cash and stock. That was 18 percent above where Rockwell’s stock was traded on Aug. 3, a day before news reports said United Technologies was considering a bid. When the assumption of Rockwell’s debt is included, the enterprise value for the deal is about $30 billion. Barbara Noverini, an analyst at Morningstar, calculated in a research note that the purchase price amounted to 14 times Rockwell’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. Other big aerospace deals were valued at roughly 13 times Ebitda. Two of the companies’ major customers did not exactly welcome the deal with open arms. Boeing, in its statement, warned that it would turn to regulators for help if the combination threatened competition in parts manufacturing. And Airbus, whose new lineup of jets has experienced delays because of problems with the latest batch of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, said it hoped the deal ""would not distract UTC from their top operational priority.” Both Boeing and Airbus have increasingly stepped into the business of servicing airplane parts in the aftermarket, traditionally the province of component makers like United and Rockwell. Mr. Hayes said in the telephone interview that he would spend this week pitching his customers on the benefits of the deal. Some analysts also said that collecting even the estimated $500 million in cost savings might be difficult, given the small overlap in the two businesses and the fact that Rockwell Collins is already regarded as efficiently run. At the end of the day, however, Mr. Hayes defended the transaction as simply being a good deal. “It’s just a great combination on so many levels that I don’t think anyone will say that we overpaid at the end of the day,” he told analysts.",The New York Times
2017,Unpopular Delusions and the Madness of Elites,"Who rules the American right? I fairly often find myself talking with people who see either the nation as a whole or at least the right side of the political spectrum as a pure oligarchy, where the big money controls everything. And money definitely plays an outsized and generally malign role in policy. Usually, however, it’s only the root of some evil, not all evil: the vileness of a Roy Moore or Joe Arpaio comes from very different sources, But one area where the simplistic view is close to correct is tax policy. There really is no clamor, even among Republicans, for tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations. And overall public opinion is strongly against. Nor is there a technocratic case for these cuts. There is no evidence whatsoever that tax cuts produce great economic outcomes — zero, zilch, nada. The “experts” who claim otherwise are all hired guns, and notably incompetent hired guns at that. Yet faith in and demands for tax cuts remains; it’s the ultimate zombie idea. And it’s obvious why: advocating tax cuts for the rich and inventing rationales for those cuts is very lucrative.",The New York Times
2017,"Unranked Maryland Upends No. 23 Texas, Spoiling a Coach’s Debut","Maryland 51, Texas 41 AUSTIN. Tex. — With a new head coach and the promise that the program is already on the rebound with its $10 million locker room, big wins in recruiting for the future and some good-looking talent for the present, the focus was on Texas and Tom Herman. Then Maryland spoiled the Longhorns’ unveiling — in an emphatic fashion. Tyrrell Pigrome passed for two touchdowns and ran for another before leaving with an injury on Saturday, and Maryland stunned No. 23 Texas, 51-41. Even after Pigrome twisted his knee and was helped off late in the third quarter, the freshman Kasim Hill came in and led two crucial fourth-quarter touchdown drives that put the game out of reach. Maryland (1-0) led, 27-7, in the second quarter, then held off a Texas rally to halt a 17-game losing streak to ranked opponents, the third-longest streak among Power 5 conference teams. “It’s a breakthrough for the program,” said Maryland wide receiver D. J. Moore, who finished with 133 yards and a touchdown. “No one knew what to expect.” The Longhorns scored three non-offensive touchdowns: a 31-yard interception return and a 65-yard return of a blocked field goal by Holton Hill; and a 91-yard punt return by Reggie Hemphill-Mapps. But those highlights could not deliver a win for Herman, who was brought from Houston to replace Charlie Strong after three straight losing seasons. Texas had its same problems: It gave up a special-teams touchdown, it missed field goals, and its defense was battered and gave up big plays. Shane Buechele passed for 375 yards for Texas (0-1). “I told our guys to never get used to this feeling, but that if we all thought that we were going to come in here and, in nine months, sprinkle some fairy dust on this team and think that we’ve arrived, then we’re wrong,” Herman said.",The New York Times
2017,Unzipping After a Big Night Out,"Metropolitan Diary Dear Diary: I had the opportunity to attend the Tony Awards and arrived home at midnight, happy but also ready to get out of my gown. I was able to unzip it about three inches by pulling the zipper from above, but when I twisted my arm around to complete the job, I couldn’t reach the zipper. After struggling for a few minutes, I put my shoes back on, walked to the building next door and asked the doorman if he could please unzip me. He kindly assisted me. I thought about how, in their acceptance speeches, a number of the Tony winners had acknowledged their dressers. I returned to my building with a smile. “I have one now, too,” I thought.",The New York Times
2017,"Upon Reflection, Mets Won’t Start Matt Harvey on Short Rest","For most of Tuesday, Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson, Manager Terry Collins and the team’s pitching coach, Dan Warthen, all seemed to be of the same mind — that it would be beneficial for Matt Harvey to start Wednesday’s game against the Philadelphia Phillies, even though he would be doing so on short rest. Their prevailing wisdom was that Harvey wanted to quickly get back on the mound after his poor outing on Saturday against the Houston Astros and that his eagerness should be honored since it might help his overall confidence. The fact that Harvey’s career has repeatedly fallen victim to injury and that pitching on three days of rest instead of four appeared to be a little risky seemed to be of less importance to the Mets’ hierarchy. But between the time of the Mets’ pregame news conferences on Tuesday and the end of Tuesday night’s game — a 9-1 loss to Philadelphia — something changed. Without being asked, Collins volunteered that Harvey would not be pitching on Wednesday after all. “By the way, we have reconsidered, and Matt Harvey will not pitch tomorrow,’’ he told reporters in his postgame interview session. “He will pitch on Thursday.” Asked who would, in fact, pitch on Wednesday for the Mets, Collins said, “I haven’t the faintest idea just yet.” Welcome to another day in a deteriorating season for the Mets. The decision to pitch Harvey on three days of rest — something he had never done in 96 career starts, according to Baseball Reference — had first been disclosed on Monday and immediately raised questions. “Well, we took into account the fact that he only threw 70 pitches the other day,” Alderson said a day later when pressed about the decision. “We don’t think there’s a significant medical risk to him at this point. And he wants to get back on the mound.” Collins said, “We’re talking about an injury that’s not a muscular thing, it’s a bone issue,” in reference to the stress injury to the scapula bone in Harvey’s pitching shoulder that caused him to shut down in June and not pitch again until his rocky performance this past Saturday. “He feels great,’’ Collins added. “Even though the success wasn’t there, he came out of the last start feeling really good the next day, which was a big test for us.” The scapula problem was just the latest in a series of injuries that have derailed Harvey’s career since August 2013. Until that point, he had emerged as one of the most intimidating pitchers in baseball. But since then, he has undergone Tommy John surgery that cost him the entire 2014 season, surgery in 2016 to address thoracic outlet syndrome, and then the long layoff this season. And when he has pitched the past two seasons, he has not, in general, looked impressive. So the fact that Harvey struggled so mightily in his latest return was perhaps not that surprising. Initially slotting him to pitch this Wednesday was, however. “It was Matt’s idea, and the manager and pitching coach endorsed it,” Alderson said on Tuesday. “So I was O.K. with it.” But by the end of Tuesday’s game, the Mets no longer were. INSIDE PITCH Jacob deGrom allowed a career-high nine runs, six of them earned, in three and two-thirds innings, his shortest outing of the season, as the Phillies routed the Mets, 9-1. The Phillies scored six runs in the fourth inning, two on a home run by their starting pitcher, Ben Lively, who also had a two-run single in the second. Right fielder Nick Williams also drove in three runs with a bases-loaded double off reliever Josh Smoker in the fourth. Lively held the Mets to one run on four hits, including Travis d’Arnaud’s run-scoring double in the first. The Mets loaded the bases against reliever Hoby Milner in the eighth but failed to score when Juan Lagares hit into an inning-ending double play.",The New York Times
